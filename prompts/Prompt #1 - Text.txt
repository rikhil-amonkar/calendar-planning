You need to schedule a meeting for Harold and Patrick for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. Harold’s calendar is wide open the entire day. Patrick is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30; Find a time that works for everyone’s schedule and constraints. Reassess: Make sure to find a time that is half an hour long, no more and no less. Also, the time found should be of the earliest among all options. Do not find times that are after the earliest. Do not find times that are more than half-an-hour long. Do not find times where Patrick is busy. Do not find times that are before 9:00 or after 17:00 on Monday. Give me a short solution in plain text.
