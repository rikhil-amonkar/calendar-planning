Elizabeth will be at Mission District from 10:30AM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 90 minutes. David will be at Union Square from 3:15PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 45 minutes. Sandra will be at Pacific Heights from 7:00AM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 120 minutes. Thomas will be at Bayview from 7:30PM to 8:30PM. You'd like to meet Thomas for a minimum of 30 minutes. Robert will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 10:00AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 15 minutes. Kenneth will be at Marina District from 10:45AM to 1:00PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 45 minutes. Melissa will be at Richmond District from 6:15PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 15 minutes. Kimberly will be at Sunset District from 10:15AM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 105 minutes. Amanda will be at Golden Gate Park from 7:45AM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Amanda for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
