William will be at Alamo Square from 3:15PM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 60 minutes. Joshua will be at Richmond District from 7:00AM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 15 minutes. Joseph will be at Financial District from 11:15AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 15 minutes. David will be at Union Square from 4:45PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 45 minutes. Brian will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 1:45PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 105 minutes. Karen will be at Marina District from 11:30AM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 15 minutes. Anthony will be at Haight-Ashbury from 7:15AM to 10:30AM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 30 minutes. Matthew will be at Mission District from 5:15PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 120 minutes. Helen will be at Pacific Heights from 8:00AM to 12:00PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 75 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Golden Gate Park from 7:00PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
