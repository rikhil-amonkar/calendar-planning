Linda will be at Marina District from 6:00PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Linda for a minimum of 30 minutes. Kenneth will be at The Castro from 2:45PM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 30 minutes. Kimberly will be at Richmond District from 2:15PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 30 minutes. Paul will be at Alamo Square from 9:00PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Paul for a minimum of 15 minutes. Carol will be at Financial District from 10:15AM to 12:00PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 60 minutes. Brian will be at Presidio from 10:00AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 75 minutes. Laura will be at Mission District from 4:15PM to 8:30PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 30 minutes. Sandra will be at Nob Hill from 9:15AM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 60 minutes. Karen will be at Russian Hill from 6:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
