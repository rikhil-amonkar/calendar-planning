Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nRichmond District to Pacific Heights: 10.\nRichmond District to Marina District: 9.\nPacific Heights to Richmond District: 12.\nPacific Heights to Marina District: 6.\nMarina District to Richmond District: 11.\nMarina District to Pacific Heights: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Richmond District at 9:00AM. Jessica will be at Pacific Heights from 3:30PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 45 minutes. Carol will be at Marina District from 11:30AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
