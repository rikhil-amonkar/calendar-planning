Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nPacific Heights to Nob Hill: 8.\nPacific Heights to Russian Hill: 7.\nPacific Heights to The Castro: 16.\nPacific Heights to Sunset District: 21.\nPacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury: 11.\nNob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8.\nNob Hill to Russian Hill: 5.\nNob Hill to The Castro: 17.\nNob Hill to Sunset District: 25.\nNob Hill to Haight-Ashbury: 13.\nRussian Hill to Pacific Heights: 7.\nRussian Hill to Nob Hill: 5.\nRussian Hill to The Castro: 21.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to Haight-Ashbury: 17.\nThe Castro to Pacific Heights: 16.\nThe Castro to Nob Hill: 16.\nThe Castro to Russian Hill: 18.\nThe Castro to Sunset District: 17.\nThe Castro to Haight-Ashbury: 6.\nSunset District to Pacific Heights: 21.\nSunset District to Nob Hill: 27.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to The Castro: 17.\nSunset District to Haight-Ashbury: 15.\nHaight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights: 12.\nHaight-Ashbury to Nob Hill: 15.\nHaight-Ashbury to Russian Hill: 17.\nHaight-Ashbury to The Castro: 6.\nHaight-Ashbury to Sunset District: 15.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Pacific Heights at 9:00AM. Ronald will be at Nob Hill from 10:00AM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 105 minutes. Sarah will be at Russian Hill from 7:15AM to 9:30AM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 45 minutes. Helen will be at The Castro from 1:30PM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Joshua will be at Sunset District from 2:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 90 minutes. Margaret will be at Haight-Ashbury from 10:15AM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
