Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nThe Castro to Mission District: 7.\nThe Castro to Financial District: 20.\nMission District to The Castro: 7.\nMission District to Financial District: 17.\nFinancial District to The Castro: 23.\nFinancial District to Mission District: 17.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at The Castro at 9:00AM. Laura will be at Mission District from 12:15PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 75 minutes. Anthony will be at Financial District from 12:30PM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."

It checks if Laura's and Anthony's constraints are met, handles cases where the travel time between two locations is not found, and handles cases where the arrival time is invalid. It also checks if the itinerary is empty and prints an error message if any of the constraints are not met."
