Matthew will be at The Castro from 4:30PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 45 minutes. Rebecca will be at Nob Hill from 3:15PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 105 minutes. Brian will be at Marina District from 2:15PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 30 minutes. Emily will be at Pacific Heights from 11:15AM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 15 minutes. Karen will be at Haight-Ashbury from 11:45AM to 5:30PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 30 minutes. Stephanie will be at Mission District from 1:00PM to 3:45PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 75 minutes. James will be at Chinatown from 2:30PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet James for a minimum of 120 minutes. Steven will be at Russian Hill from 2:00PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 30 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Alamo Square from 1:00PM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 120 minutes. William will be at Bayview from 6:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
