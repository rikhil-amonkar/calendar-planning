In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ryan, Ruth and Denise for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nRyan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nRuthhas no meetings the whole day.\nDenise has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:30; \n\nDenise do not want to meet on Monday after 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

It iterates over each hour in the workday and checks if the time slot is available for all participants. If a time slot is found, it returns the time slot and day of the week. If no time slot is found, it returns a message. The script then defines the existing schedules, meeting duration, start and end times, and calls the `find_meeting_time` function to find a proposed time slot. Finally, it prints the proposed time slot and day of the week."
