        "content": "You are an expert at scheduling meetings. Your task is to find a suitable time for a meeting based on the participants' schedules and constraints. In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Joe, Keith, Patricia, Nancy and Pamela for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJoe has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00; \nKeith has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nPatricia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 13:30; \nNancy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 16:30; \nPamela has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

It iterates over all possible time slots and checks if the time slot is available for all participants using the `is_available` function. If a time slot is found that is available for all participants, it returns the time slot and the day of the week.\n\nThe script then defines participants' schedules, meeting duration, and work hours, and calls the `find_meeting_time` function to find a proposed time. Finally, it prints the proposed time and day of the week."
