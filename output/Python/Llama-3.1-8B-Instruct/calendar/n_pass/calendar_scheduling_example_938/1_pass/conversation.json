In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Eugene and Eric for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nEugene is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:30, Friday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30; \nEric is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 17:00, Friday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00; \n\nEric would like to avoid more meetings on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

The `find_meeting_time` function then iterates over the preferred days for Eric, checks for available time slots that are not conflicting with either Eugene's or Eric's schedule, and returns the first available time slot that is long enough to accommodate the meeting. If no suitable time is found, it returns a message indicating this."
