In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Eric and Henry for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nEric has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00; \nHenry has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nHenry would rather not meet on Monday after 10:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

If a suitable time is found, it returns the proposed meeting time and day of the week. If no suitable time is found, it returns `None` for both the proposed time and day of the week.\n\nThe `main` function defines the start and end time of the work hours, the meeting duration, and the schedules of the participants. It calls the `find_meeting_time` function to find a suitable time for the meeting and prints the proposed meeting time and day of the week."
