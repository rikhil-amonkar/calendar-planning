In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Julie and Ruth for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJuliehas no meetings the whole week.\nRuth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \n\nJulie would like to avoid more meetings on Thursday before 11:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

It then iterates over each half hour of the day to find a time slot that is available for both Julie and Ruth. If a time slot is found, it returns the start and end times in the format HH:MM-HH:MM and the day of the week.\n\nIn this example, the script schedules a meeting for Julie and Ruth on Thursday at 11:30-11:30 (half hour is the meeting duration) Thursday."
