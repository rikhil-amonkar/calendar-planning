You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Lyon for 3 days. You would like to visit Paris for 5 days. You plan to stay in Riga for 2 days. You plan to stay in Berlin for 2 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Berlin between day 1 and day 2. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 3 days. From day 20 to day 22, there is a annual show you want to attend in Stockholm. You plan to stay in Zurich for 5 days. You want to spend 2 days in Nice. You have to attend a workshop in Nice between day 12 and day 13. You plan to stay in Seville for 3 days. You want to spend 3 days in Milan. You would like to visit Naples for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nParis and Stockholm, Seville and Paris, Naples and Zurich, Nice and Riga, Berlin and Milan, Paris and Zurich, Paris and Nice, Milan and Paris, Milan and Riga, Paris and Lyon, Milan and Naples, Paris and Riga, Berlin and Stockholm, Stockholm and Riga, Nice and Zurich, Milan and Zurich, Lyon and Nice, Zurich and Stockholm, Zurich and Riga, Berlin and Naples, Milan and Stockholm, Berlin and Zurich, Milan and Seville, Paris and Naples, Berlin and Riga, Nice and Stockholm, Berlin and Paris, Nice and Naples, Berlin and Nice.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 23 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
