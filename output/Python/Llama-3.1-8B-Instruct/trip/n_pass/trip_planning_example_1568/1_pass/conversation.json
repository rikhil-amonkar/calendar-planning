You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 5 days in Prague. From day 5 to day 9, there is a annual show you want to attend in Prague. You want to spend 2 days in Brussels. You want to spend 2 days in Riga. You would like to meet your friends at Riga between day 15 and day 16 to tour together. You would like to visit Munich for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Seville. You would like to visit Stockholm for 2 days. During day 16 and day 17, you have to attend a conference in Stockholm. You plan to stay in Istanbul for 2 days. You plan to stay in Amsterdam for 3 days. You want to spend 5 days in Vienna. You want to meet a friend in Vienna between day 1 and day 5. You want to spend 3 days in Split. You plan to visit relatives in Split between day 11 and day 13.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nRiga and Stockholm, Stockholm and Brussels, Istanbul and Munich, Istanbul and Riga, Prague and Split, Vienna and Brussels, Vienna and Riga, Split and Stockholm, Munich and Amsterdam, Split and Amsterdam, Amsterdam and Stockholm, Amsterdam and Riga, Vienna and Stockholm, Vienna and Istanbul, Vienna and Seville, Istanbul and Amsterdam, Munich and Brussels, Prague and Munich, from Riga to Munich, Prague and Amsterdam, Prague and Brussels, Prague and Istanbul, Istanbul and Stockholm, Vienna and Prague, Munich and Split, Vienna and Amsterdam, Prague and Stockholm, Brussels and Seville, Munich and Stockholm, Istanbul and Brussels, Amsterdam and Seville, Vienna and Split, Munich and Seville, Riga and Brussels, Prague and Riga, Vienna and Munich.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
