You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Venice for 3 days. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 2 days. You would like to visit Munich for 3 days. From day 4 to day 6, there is a annual show you want to attend in Munich. You would like to visit Santorini for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Santorini between day 8 and day 10. You would like to visit Manchester for 3 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 3 days. You would like to visit Bucharest for 5 days. You want to spend 4 days in Tallinn. You want to spend 2 days in Valencia. You have to attend a workshop in Valencia between day 14 and day 15. You plan to stay in Vienna for 5 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBucharest and Manchester, Munich and Venice, Santorini and Manchester, Vienna and Reykjavik, Venice and Santorini, Munich and Porto, Valencia and Vienna, Manchester and Vienna, Porto and Vienna, Venice and Manchester, Santorini and Vienna, Munich and Manchester, Munich and Reykjavik, Bucharest and Valencia, Venice and Vienna, Bucharest and Vienna, Porto and Manchester, Munich and Vienna, Valencia and Porto, Munich and Bucharest, Tallinn and Munich, Santorini and Bucharest, Munich and Valencia.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 24 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
