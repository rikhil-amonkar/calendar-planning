You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 4 days in Vienna. You would like to visit Lyon for 3 days. You plan to stay in Edinburgh for 4 days. From day 5 to day 8, there is a annual show you want to attend in Edinburgh. You want to spend 5 days in Reykjavik. You want to spend 5 days in Stuttgart. You would like to visit Manchester for 2 days. You want to spend 5 days in Split. You are going to attend a wedding in Split between day 19 and day 23. You plan to stay in Prague for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nfrom Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Stuttgart and Split, Stuttgart and Vienna, Prague and Manchester, Edinburgh and Prague, from Manchester to Split, Prague and Vienna, Vienna and Manchester, Prague and Split, Vienna and Lyon, Stuttgart and Edinburgh, Split and Lyon, Stuttgart and Manchester, Prague and Lyon, Reykjavik and Vienna, Prague and Reykjavik, Vienna and Split.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."

The `compute_itinerary` method computes the optimal itinerary based on the given constraints. The `plan_trip` method adjusts the itinerary to account for the annual show in Edinburgh and the wedding in Split. The `load_constraints` function loads the trip constraints from a dictionary, and the `main` function creates a `TripPlanner` instance, computes the itinerary, and prints it as a JSON-formatted string."
