In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kimberly, Megan, Marie and Diana for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMeganhas no meetings the whole day.\nMarie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDiana is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nMegan would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 10:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a meeting that fits within the work hours of all participants, considering their existing schedules and constraints. The solution involves analyzing the busy intervals of each participant, merging these intervals to find collective busy periods, and then identifying free intervals that can accommodate the meeting duration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent all time slots in minutes from a reference point (9:00 AM as 0 minutes) for easier calculations.\n2. **Collect Busy Intervals**: Gather all busy intervals for each participant, including any constraints (e.g., Megan prefers no meetings before 10:00 AM).\n3. **Merge Busy Intervals**: Combine overlapping or adjacent busy intervals across all participants to form a list of non-overlapping busy periods.\n4. **Find Free Intervals**: Determine the gaps between the merged busy intervals within the workday (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM).\n5. **Check Meeting Duration**: Identify the first free interval that can accommodate the meeting duration (30 minutes).\n6. **Convert Back to Time Format**: Translate the identified free interval back to the HH:MM time format and output the result along with the day of the week.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 -> 0 to 480 minutes (from 9:00)\n    work_start = 0\n    work_end = 480  # 17:00 - 9:00 = 8 hours = 480 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Busy intervals for each participant in minutes (start, end)\n    kimberly = [(60, 90), (120, 180), (420, 450)]\n    megan = [(0, 60)]  # Avoid before 10:00, so busy from 9:00 to 10:00\n    marie = [(60, 120), (150, 360), (420, 450)]\n    diana = [(30, 60), (90, 330), (390, 480)]\n    \n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    all_busy = kimberly + megan + marie + diana\n    \n    # Sort by start time\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    # Merge intervals\n    merged_busy = []\n    if all_busy:\n        current_start, current_end = all_busy[0]\n        for i in range(1, len(all_busy)):\n            s, e = all_busy[i]\n            if s <= current_end:\n                current_end = max(current_end, e)\n            else:\n                merged_busy.append((current_start, current_end))\n                current_start, current_end = s, e\n        merged_busy.append((current_start, current_end))\n    else:\n        merged_busy = []\n    \n    # Find free intervals\n    free_intervals = []\n    prev_end = work_start\n    for start, end in merged_busy:\n        if start > prev_end:\n            free_intervals.append((prev_end, start))\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, end)\n    if prev_end < work_end:\n        free_intervals.append((prev_end, work_end))\n    \n    # Find the first free interval that can fit the meeting\n    meeting_start = None\n    for start, end in free_intervals:\n        if end - start >= meeting_duration:\n            meeting_start = start\n            meeting_end = start + meeting_duration\n            break\n    \n    if meeting_start is None:\n        print(\"No suitable time found\")\n    else:\n        # Convert meeting_start and meeting_end to time strings\n        total_minutes_start = meeting_start\n        hours_start = 9 + total_minutes_start // 60\n        minutes_start = total_minutes_start % 60\n        total_minutes_end = meeting_end\n        hours_end = 9 + total_minutes_end // 60\n        minutes_end = total_minutes_end % 60\n        \n        # Format as HH:MM\n        start_str = f\"{hours_start:02d}:{minutes_start:02d}\"\n        end_str = f\"{hours_end:02d}:{minutes_end:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output the day and time in the required format\n        print(\"Monday\")\n        print(f\"{start_str}:{end_str}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The script converts all time slots into minutes starting from 9:00 AM (0 minutes) to 5:00 PM (480 minutes) for uniformity.\n2. **Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are listed in minutes. For example, Kimberly's 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM slot is converted to (60, 90).\n3. **Merging Intervals**: The script combines overlapping or adjacent busy intervals from all participants into a list of non-overlapping intervals. For instance, Megan's constraint (no meetings before 10:00 AM) is treated as a busy interval from 0 to 60 minutes.\n4. **Free Intervals**: The gaps between merged busy intervals are calculated. These gaps represent potential meeting times.\n5. **Meeting Duration Check**: The first free interval that can accommodate the 30-minute meeting is selected. If no such interval exists, a message is printed.\n6. **Output**: The selected interval is converted back to HH:MM format and printed along with the day (Monday in this case). For example, a free interval from 360 to 390 minutes translates to 15:00 to 15:30.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the available time slots by leveraging interval merging and ensures the solution meets all given constraints."
