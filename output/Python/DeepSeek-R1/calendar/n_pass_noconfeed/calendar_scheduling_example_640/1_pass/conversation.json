In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Bobby and Michael for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBobby is busy on Monday during 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nMichael is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the earliest available 30-minute meeting slot between two participants, Bobby and Michael, within their working hours (9:00 to 17:00) on either Monday or Tuesday. The solution involves analyzing their busy schedules, merging overlapping busy intervals, and identifying the earliest free slot that accommodates the meeting duration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert all time strings (like \"9:00\") into minutes past midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Define Busy Intervals**: Hardcode the busy intervals for both participants for each day (Monday and Tuesday) based on the given schedules.\n3. **Merge Busy Intervals**: Combine the busy intervals of both participants for each day, merging any overlapping intervals to form a list of non-overlapping busy periods.\n4. **Calculate Free Intervals**: For each day, compute the free intervals by finding gaps between the merged busy intervals within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n5. **Find Earliest Meeting Slot**: Iterate through the free intervals for each day in order (Monday first, then Tuesday) and check for the first interval that can fit a 30-minute meeting. Convert the start and end times of the meeting back to the \"HH:MM\" format and output the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    parts = time_str.split(':')\n    return int(parts[0]) * 60 + int(parts[1])\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    h = minutes // 60\n    m = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n\ndef merge_intervals(intervals):\n    if not intervals:\n        return []\n    sorted_intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    merged = []\n    start, end = sorted_intervals[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_intervals)):\n        s, e = sorted_intervals[i]\n        if s <= end:\n            if e > end:\n                end = e\n        else:\n            merged.append((start, end))\n            start, end = s, e\n    merged.append((start, end))\n    return merged\n\nbobby_busy = {\n    'Monday': [('14:30', '15:00')],\n    'Tuesday': [('9:00', '11:30'), ('12:00', '12:30'), ('13:00', '15:00'), ('15:30', '17:00')]\n}\n\nmichael_busy = {\n    'Monday': [('9:00', '10:00'), ('10:30', '13:30'), ('14:00', '15:00'), ('15:30', '17:00')],\n    'Tuesday': [('9:00', '10:30'), ('11:00', '11:30'), ('12:00', '14:00'), ('15:00', '16:00'), ('16:30', '17:00')]\n}\n\nwork_start_min = 540  # 9:00\nwork_end_min = 1020   # 17:00\n\ndays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday']\n\nfor day in days:\n    b_intervals = bobby_busy[day]\n    m_intervals = michael_busy[day]\n    all_busy = []\n    for interval in b_intervals:\n        s, e = interval\n        s_min = time_to_minutes(s)\n        e_min = time_to_minutes(e)\n        all_busy.append((s_min, e_min))\n    for interval in m_intervals:\n        s, e = interval\n        s_min = time_to_minutes(s)\n        e_min = time_to_minutes(e)\n        all_busy.append((s_min, e_min))\n    \n    merged_busy = merge_intervals(all_busy)\n    \n    free_intervals = []\n    current = work_start_min\n    for start, end in merged_busy:\n        if current < start:\n            free_intervals.append((current, start))\n        current = max(current, end)\n    if current < work_end_min:\n        free_intervals.append((current, work_end_min))\n    \n    for start_free, end_free in free_intervals:\n        duration = end_free - start_free\n        if duration >= 30:\n            meeting_start = start_free\n            meeting_end = start_free + 30\n            start_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_start)\n            end_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n            print(f\"{start_str}:{end_str}\")\n            print(day)\n            exit(0)\n\nprint(\"No meeting time found\")\nexit(1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `time_to_minutes` function converts time strings (e.g., \"9:00\") into integer values representing minutes past midnight. The `minutes_to_time` function converts these integer values back into formatted time strings.\n2. **Busy Intervals**: The busy intervals for Bobby and Michael are defined in dictionaries (`bobby_busy` and `michael_busy`) for each day (Monday and Tuesday).\n3. **Merging Intervals**: The `merge_intervals` function combines overlapping busy intervals from both participants into a list of non-overlapping intervals for each day.\n4. **Free Intervals Calculation**: For each day, the algorithm calculates free intervals by examining gaps between merged busy intervals within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n5. **Finding the Earliest Slot**: The algorithm checks each free interval in chronological order. The first interval that can accommodate a 30-minute meeting is selected. The meeting start and end times are formatted into \"HH:MM:HH:MM\" and printed along with the day of the week.\n\nThis approach efficiently identifies the earliest available meeting slot by leveraging interval merging and gap analysis, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."
