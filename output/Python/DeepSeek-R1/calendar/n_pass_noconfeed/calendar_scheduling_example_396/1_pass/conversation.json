In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Andrea, Jack, Madison, Rachel, Douglas and Ryan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAndrea's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nJack has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:00 to 14:30; \nMadison has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nRachel is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nDouglas is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 16:30; \nRyan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a meeting that fits within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday, considering the busy schedules of all participants. The meeting duration is 30 minutes. The solution involves analyzing the busy intervals of each participant, merging overlapping intervals, and then identifying the first available gap that can accommodate the meeting.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time Strings to Minutes**: For easier manipulation, each time string (e.g., \"9:00\") is converted into minutes past midnight.\n2. **Collect Busy Intervals**: Gather all busy intervals from each participant's schedule.\n3. **Merge Busy Intervals**: Combine overlapping or adjacent busy intervals to form a list of non-overlapping intervals.\n4. **Find Available Gaps**: Identify gaps between the merged busy intervals (and between work hours and the first/last busy interval) that are at least 30 minutes long.\n5. **Select the First Available Gap**: The first such gap found is chosen as the meeting time.\n6. **Convert Back to Time Format**: Convert the start and end times of the meeting gap back to \"HH:MM\" format for the output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    work_start_min = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end_min = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30    # minutes\n\n    # Convert time string to minutes\n    def time_str_to_minutes(time_str):\n        parts = time_str.split(':')\n        return int(parts[0]) * 60 + int(parts[1])\n\n    # Define busy intervals for each participant\n    participants_busy = {\n        'Andrea': [],\n        'Jack': [(\"9:00\", \"9:30\"), (\"14:00\", \"14:30\")],\n        'Madison': [(\"9:30\", \"10:30\"), (\"13:00\", \"14:00\"), (\"15:00\", \"15:30\"), (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")],\n        'Rachel': [(\"9:30\", \"10:30\"), (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"), (\"12:00\", \"13:30\"), (\"14:30\", \"15:30\"), (\"16:00\", \"17:00\")],\n        'Douglas': [(\"9:00\", \"11:30\"), (\"12:00\", \"16:30\")],\n        'Ryan': [(\"9:00\", \"9:30\"), (\"13:00\", \"14:00\"), (\"14:30\", \"17:00\")]\n    }\n\n    # Collect all busy intervals in minutes\n    all_busy = []\n    for person, intervals in participants_busy.items():\n        for interval in intervals:\n            start_min = time_str_to_minutes(interval[0])\n            end_min = time_str_to_minutes(interval[1])\n            all_busy.append((start_min, end_min))\n    \n    # Sort intervals by start time\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    # Merge intervals\n    merged_busy = []\n    if all_busy:\n        merged_busy = [all_busy[0]]\n        for i in range(1, len(all_busy)):\n            current = all_busy[i]\n            last = merged_busy[-1]\n            if current[0] <= last[1]:\n                merged_busy[-1] = (last[0], max(last[1], current[1]))\n            else:\n                merged_busy.append(current)\n    \n    # Find free gaps\n    gaps = []\n    current_start = work_start_min\n    for busy_interval in merged_busy:\n        if busy_interval[0] > current_start:\n            gap_duration = busy_interval[0] - current_start\n            if gap_duration >= meeting_duration:\n                gaps.append((current_start, busy_interval[0]))\n        current_start = max(current_start, busy_interval[1])\n    \n    # Check after the last busy interval\n    if current_start < work_end_min:\n        gap_duration = work_end_min - current_start\n        if gap_duration >= meeting_duration:\n            gaps.append((current_start, work_end_min))\n    \n    # Select the first gap\n    if gaps:\n        gap_start, gap_end = gaps[0]\n        meeting_start = gap_start\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n        \n        # Convert meeting times back to HH:MM format\n        def min_to_time(minutes):\n            h = minutes // 60\n            m = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n        \n        start_str = min_to_time(meeting_start)\n        end_str = min_to_time(meeting_end)\n        \n        print(\"Monday\")\n        print(f\"{start_str}:{end_str}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The function `time_str_to_minutes` converts time strings (e.g., \"9:00\") into integer values representing minutes past midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Busy Intervals Collection**: Each participant's busy intervals are stored in a dictionary. These intervals are converted to minutes and collected into a list.\n3. **Merging Intervals**: The busy intervals are sorted by their start time. Overlapping or adjacent intervals are merged to form a list of non-overlapping intervals, simplifying the identification of free time slots.\n4. **Finding Gaps**: The algorithm checks for gaps between the merged busy intervals and the work hours. Any gap of at least 30 minutes is considered a potential meeting slot.\n5. **Output**: The first available meeting slot is converted back to \"HH:MM\" format. The day (\"Monday\") and the meeting time slot (e.g., \"11:30:12:00\") are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the available time slots by leveraging interval merging and gap analysis, ensuring the solution meets all constraints provided."
