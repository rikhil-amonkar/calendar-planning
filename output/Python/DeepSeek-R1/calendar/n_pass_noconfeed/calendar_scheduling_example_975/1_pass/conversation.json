In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Nicole and Daniel for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nNicole has meetings on Tuesday during 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 15:00 to 15:30, Friday during 12:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nDaniel is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Friday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the earliest available one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 from Monday to Friday that fits both Nicole and Daniel's schedules. The solution involves analyzing their busy intervals, merging these intervals to find common free slots, and selecting the earliest possible meeting time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert time strings (like \"09:00\") into total minutes past midnight for easier calculations.\n2. **Define Busy Intervals**: Represent each participant's busy times per day as lists of intervals in minutes.\n3. **Merge Busy Intervals**: Combine and merge overlapping busy intervals from both participants for each day to find the combined busy periods.\n4. **Find Free Slots**: For each day, compute free intervals by examining gaps between the merged busy intervals and the boundaries of the workday (9:00 to 17:00).\n5. **Check Slot Duration**: Identify the first free slot of at least 60 minutes duration across the days in order.\n6. **Output Result**: Convert the identified slot back to the HH:MM format and output the day and time range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    parts = time_str.split(':')\n    return int(parts[0]) * 60 + int(parts[1])\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    h = minutes // 60\n    m = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n\ndef merge_intervals(intervals):\n    if not intervals:\n        return []\n    sorted_intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    merged = []\n    start, end = sorted_intervals[0]\n    for interval in sorted_intervals[1:]:\n        if interval[0] <= end:\n            if interval[1] > end:\n                end = interval[1]\n        else:\n            merged.append((start, end))\n            start, end = interval\n    merged.append((start, end))\n    return merged\n\ndays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']\n\nbusy_times = {\n    'Nicole': {\n        'Tuesday': [('16:00', '16:30')],\n        'Wednesday': [('15:00', '15:30')],\n        'Friday': [('12:00', '12:30'), ('15:30', '16:00')]\n    },\n    'Daniel': {\n        'Monday': [('09:00', '12:30'), ('13:00', '13:30'), ('14:00', '16:30')],\n        'Tuesday': [('09:00', '10:30'), ('11:30', '12:30'), ('13:00', '13:30'), ('15:00', '16:00'), ('16:30', '17:00')],\n        'Wednesday': [('09:00', '10:00'), ('11:00', '12:30'), ('13:00', '13:30'), ('14:00', '14:30'), ('16:30', '17:00')],\n        'Thursday': [('11:00', '12:00'), ('13:00', '14:00'), ('15:00', '15:30')],\n        'Friday': [('10:00', '11:00'), ('11:30', '12:00'), ('12:30', '14:30'), ('15:00', '15:30'), ('16:00', '16:30')]\n    }\n}\n\nwork_start = time_to_minutes('09:00')\nwork_end = time_to_minutes('17:00')\nmeeting_duration = 60\n\nfound = False\nresult_day = None\nresult_start = None\n\nfor day in days:\n    all_busy_intervals = []\n    \n    for person in ['Nicole', 'Daniel']:\n        if day in busy_times[person]:\n            for interval in busy_times[person][day]:\n                start_min = time_to_minutes(interval[0])\n                end_min = time_to_minutes(interval[1])\n                all_busy_intervals.append((start_min, end_min))\n    \n    if not all_busy_intervals:\n        slot_start = work_start\n        slot_end = work_start + meeting_duration\n        if slot_end <= work_end:\n            result_day = day\n            result_start = slot_start\n            found = True\n            break\n    else:\n        merged_busy = merge_intervals(all_busy_intervals)\n        current_time = work_start\n        for busy_start, busy_end in merged_busy:\n            if current_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start:\n                slot_start = current_time\n                slot_end = current_time + meeting_duration\n                if slot_end <= work_end:\n                    result_day = day\n                    result_start = slot_start\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n        if found:\n            break\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= work_end:\n            slot_start = current_time\n            slot_end = current_time + meeting_duration\n            result_day = day\n            result_start = slot_start\n            found = True\n            break\n    if found:\n        break\n\nif found:\n    start_time_str = minutes_to_time(result_start)\n    end_time_str = minutes_to_time(result_start + meeting_duration)\n    print(f\"{result_day}:{start_time_str}:{end_time_str}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No suitable time slot found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `time_to_minutes` function converts time strings (e.g., \"09:00\") into minutes since midnight, and `minutes_to_time` converts minutes back to HH:MM format.\n2. **Merging Intervals**: The `merge_intervals` function combines overlapping or adjacent busy intervals to simplify finding free slots.\n3. **Busy Times Setup**: The `busy_times` dictionary holds each participant's busy intervals per day.\n4. **Finding Free Slots**: For each day, the code:\n   - Collects all busy intervals from both participants.\n   - Merges these intervals to find contiguous busy periods.\n   - Checks for gaps between these busy periods and the workday boundaries to find free slots of at least 60 minutes.\n5. **Output**: The earliest valid free slot is converted back to HH:MM format and printed with the corresponding day.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each day in order, ensuring the earliest possible meeting time is found while respecting both participants' schedules."
