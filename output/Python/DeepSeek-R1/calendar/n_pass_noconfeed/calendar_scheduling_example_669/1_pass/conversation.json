In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jean and Doris for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJean is busy on Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDoris has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nDoris would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a meeting between Jean and Doris that fits within their existing schedules and constraints. The meeting must last for 30 minutes and occur between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. Additionally, Doris prefers not to meet on Monday after 14:00. The solution involves analyzing their busy intervals, computing their free time slots, and finding the earliest possible meeting time that satisfies all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Work Hours and Busy Intervals**: The work hours are from 9:00 (540 minutes) to 17:00 (1020 minutes). Jean and Doris have specific busy intervals on Monday and Tuesday.\n2. **Compute Free Intervals**: For each day, compute the free intervals for both participants by subtracting their busy intervals from the work hours. This involves sorting busy intervals and merging overlapping or adjacent intervals to find contiguous free slots.\n3. **Find Common Free Intervals**: For each day, compute the intersection of Jean's and Doris's free intervals to identify time slots where both are available.\n4. **Check Constraints**: For Monday, prioritize time slots ending before 14:00 (840 minutes) to respect Doris's preference. If no such slot is found, consider any available slot on Monday. Tuesday is checked only if no valid slot is found on Monday.\n5. **Select Earliest Meeting Slot**: From the common free intervals, select the earliest possible 30-minute slot that fits within the constraints.\n6. **Output the Result**: Format the selected meeting time as \"HH:MM:HH:MM\" and the corresponding day.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nwork_start = 9 * 60\nwork_end = 17 * 60\n\njean_busy = {\n    'Monday': [],\n    'Tuesday': [(11*60+30, 12*60), (16*60, 16*60+30)]\n}\n\ndoris_busy = {\n    'Monday': [\n        (9*60, 11*60+30),\n        (12*60, 12*60+30),\n        (13*60+30, 16*60),\n        (16*60+30, 17*60)\n    ],\n    'Tuesday': [(9*60, 17*60)]\n}\n\ndays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday']\nmeeting_duration = 30\n\ndef compute_free_intervals(busy_intervals, work_start, work_end):\n    if not busy_intervals:\n        return [(work_start, work_end)]\n    sorted_busy = sorted(busy_intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    free = []\n    current = work_start\n    for start, end in sorted_busy:\n        if current < start:\n            free.append((current, start))\n        current = max(current, end)\n    if current < work_end:\n        free.append((current, work_end))\n    return free\n\nfound = False\nresult_day = None\nresult_start = None\nresult_end = None\n\nfor day in days:\n    jean_free = compute_free_intervals(jean_busy[day], work_start, work_end)\n    doris_free = compute_free_intervals(doris_busy[day], work_start, work_end)\n    common_free = []\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < len(jean_free) and j < len(doris_free):\n        j_start, j_end = jean_free[i]\n        d_start, d_end = doris_free[j]\n        low = max(j_start, d_start)\n        high = min(j_end, d_end)\n        if low < high:\n            common_free.append((low, high))\n        if j_end < d_end:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    \n    if day == 'Monday':\n        for interval in common_free:\n            start_interval, end_interval = interval\n            meeting_start = start_interval\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            if meeting_end <= end_interval and meeting_end <= 14*60:\n                result_day = day\n                result_start = meeting_start\n                result_end = meeting_end\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            break\n            \n        for interval in common_free:\n            start_interval, end_interval = interval\n            meeting_start = start_interval\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            if meeting_end <= end_interval:\n                result_day = day\n                result_start = meeting_start\n                result_end = meeting_end\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            break\n    else:\n        for interval in common_free:\n            start_interval, end_interval = interval\n            meeting_start = start_interval\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            if meeting_end <= end_interval:\n                result_day = day\n                result_start = meeting_start\n                result_end = meeting_end\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            break\n\ndef format_time(minutes):\n    h = minutes // 60\n    m = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n\nstart_str = format_time(result_start)\nend_str = format_time(result_end)\ntime_range_str = f\"{start_str}:{end_str}\"\n\nprint(result_day)\nprint(time_range_str)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The work hours are set from 9:00 (540 minutes) to 17:00 (1020 minutes). Jean's and Doris's busy intervals for Monday and Tuesday are defined.\n2. **Free Intervals Calculation**: The `compute_free_intervals` function processes busy intervals to determine free time slots within work hours. It sorts busy intervals and merges them to find contiguous free periods.\n3. **Common Free Intervals**: For each day, the code computes the intersection of Jean's and Doris's free intervals to find slots where both are available.\n4. **Meeting Slot Selection**: On Monday, the code first checks for slots ending before 14:00. If none are found, it checks any available slot. Tuesday is only considered if no valid Monday slot exists.\n5. **Result Formatting**: The selected meeting time is converted from minutes to \"HH:MM\" format for start and end times, combined into \"HH:MM:HH:MM\", and printed with the meeting day.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down available time slots while respecting all constraints, ensuring the earliest possible meeting time is selected."
