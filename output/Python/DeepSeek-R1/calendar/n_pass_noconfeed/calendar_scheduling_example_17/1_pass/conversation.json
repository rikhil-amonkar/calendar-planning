In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Margaret, Donna and Helen for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMargaret has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nDonna has blocked their calendar on Monday during 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nHelen has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nHelen do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a meeting involving three participants (Margaret, Donna, and Helen) that fits within their busy schedules and adheres to Helen's constraint of not meeting after 13:30. The meeting duration is 30 minutes and must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert all time strings (like \"9:00\") into minutes past midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Define Constraints**: The meeting must start by 13:00 (780 minutes) to ensure it ends by 13:30 (810 minutes), as per Helen's constraint.\n3. **Collect Busy Intervals**: Gather all busy intervals for each participant, converting them into minutes and clipping them to the relevant time range (9:00 to 13:30).\n4. **Merge Busy Intervals**: Combine overlapping or adjacent busy intervals from all participants to form a list of non-overlapping busy periods.\n5. **Find Free Intervals**: Identify gaps between the merged busy intervals where the meeting can be scheduled.\n6. **Check Duration**: From the free intervals, select the first gap that can accommodate the 30-minute meeting duration.\n7. **Convert and Output**: Convert the chosen meeting start and end times back to \"HH:MM\" format and output the result along with the day of the week.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    work_start_min = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end_min = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    helen_constraint_end = 13 * 60 + 30  # 13:30 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n\n    margaret_busy = [\n        [9*60, 10*60],     # 9:00-10:00\n        [10*60+30, 11*60], # 10:30-11:00\n        [11*60+30, 12*60], # 11:30-12:00\n        [13*60, 13*60+30], # 13:00-13:30\n        [15*60, 15*60+30]  # 15:00-15:30\n    ]\n    \n    donna_busy = [\n        [14*60+30, 15*60], # 14:30-15:00\n        [16*60, 16*60+30]  # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n    \n    helen_busy = [\n        [9*60, 9*60+30],   # 9:00-9:30\n        [10*60, 11*60+30], # 10:00-11:30\n        [13*60, 14*60],    # 13:00-14:00\n        [14*60+30, 15*60], # 14:30-15:00\n        [15*60+30, 17*60]  # 15:30-17:00\n    ]\n    \n    all_busy = []\n    \n    for interval in margaret_busy:\n        s, e = interval\n        if e <= work_start_min or s >= helen_constraint_end:\n            continue\n        s_clip = max(s, work_start_min)\n        e_clip = min(e, helen_constraint_end)\n        if s_clip < e_clip:\n            all_busy.append([s_clip, e_clip])\n    \n    for interval in donna_busy:\n        s, e = interval\n        if e <= work_start_min or s >= helen_constraint_end:\n            continue\n        s_clip = max(s, work_start_min)\n        e_clip = min(e, helen_constraint_end)\n        if s_clip < e_clip:\n            all_busy.append([s_clip, e_clip])\n    \n    for interval in helen_busy:\n        s, e = interval\n        if e <= work_start_min or s >= helen_constraint_end:\n            continue\n        s_clip = max(s, work_start_min)\n        e_clip = min(e, helen_constraint_end)\n        if s_clip < e_clip:\n            all_busy.append([s_clip, e_clip])\n    \n    if not all_busy:\n        merged_busy = []\n    else:\n        all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        merged_busy = []\n        start_curr, end_curr = all_busy[0]\n        for i in range(1, len(all_busy)):\n            s, e = all_busy[i]\n            if s <= end_curr:\n                if e > end_curr:\n                    end_curr = e\n            else:\n                merged_busy.append([start_curr, end_curr])\n                start_curr, end_curr = s, e\n        merged_busy.append([start_curr, end_curr])\n    \n    free_intervals = []\n    current = work_start_min\n    for interval in merged_busy:\n        s, e = interval\n        if current < s:\n            free_intervals.append([current, s])\n            current = e\n        else:\n            if e > current:\n                current = e\n    if current < helen_constraint_end:\n        free_intervals.append([current, helen_constraint_end])\n    \n    meeting_start = None\n    for interval in free_intervals:\n        start_free, end_free = interval\n        if end_free -

The script outputs the first suitable meeting time, which in this case is 12:00 to 12:30 on Monday."
