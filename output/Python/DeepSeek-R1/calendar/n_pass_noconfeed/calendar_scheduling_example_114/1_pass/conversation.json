In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Stephanie, Cheryl, Bradley and Steven for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nStephanie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nCheryl has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBradley has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nSteven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a meeting that accommodates all participants' schedules within the given work hours (9:00 to 17:00). The solution involves analyzing each participant's busy intervals, determining their free intervals, and then finding a common free interval of the required duration (60 minutes).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Translate each participant's busy time intervals from HH:MM format into minutes relative to 9:00 (which is considered as 0 minutes).\n2. **Compute Free Intervals**: For each participant, compute their free intervals by identifying gaps between their busy intervals within the workday (0 to 480 minutes, representing 9:00 to 17:00).\n3. **Find Common Free Intervals**: Intersect the free intervals of all participants to find time slots where all are free.\n4. **Check for Suitable Slot**: From the common free intervals, find the first slot that is at least 60 minutes long.\n5. **Convert Back to Time Format**: Translate the start time and end time (start time + 60 minutes) back to HH:MM format and output the result along with the day of the week.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    parts = time_str.split(':')\n    h = int(parts[0])\n    m = int(parts[1])\n    return (h - 9) * 60 + m\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    total_minutes = minutes\n    h = 9 + total_minutes // 60\n    m = total_minutes % 60\n    return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n\ndef intersect_intervals(intervals1, intervals2):\n    i = j = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(intervals1) and j < len(intervals2):\n        low = max(intervals1[i][0], intervals2[j][0])\n        high = min(intervals1[i][1], intervals2[j][1])\n        if low < high:\n            result.append((low, high))\n        if intervals1[i][1] < intervals2[j][1]:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    return result\n\nbusy_times = {\n    \"Stephanie\": [(\"10:00\", \"10:30\"), (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")],\n    \"Cheryl\": [(\"10:00\", \"10:30\"), (\"11:30\", \"12:00\"), (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"), (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")],\n    \"Bradley\": [(\"9:30\", \"10:00\"), (\"10:30\", \"11:30\"), (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"), (\"14:30\", \"15:00\"), (\"15:30\", \"17:00\")],\n    \"Steven\": [(\"9:00\", \"12:00\"), (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"), (\"14:30\", \"17:00\")]\n}\n\nbusy_intervals = {}\nfor person, intervals in busy_times.items():\n    busy_list = []\n    for (start_str, end_str) in intervals:\n        start_min = time_to_minutes(start_str)\n        end_min = time_to_minutes(end_str)\n        busy_list.append((start_min, end_min))\n    busy_intervals[person] = busy_list\n\nfree_intervals = {}\nfor person, intervals in busy_intervals.items():\n    sorted_intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    free_list = []\n    current = 0\n    for start, end in sorted_intervals:\n        if current < start:\n            free_list.append((current, start))\n        current = end\n    if current < 480:\n        free_list.append((current, 480))\n    free_intervals[person] = free_list\n\nparticipants = list(busy_intervals.keys())\ncommon_free = free_intervals[participants[0]]\nfor i in range(1, len(participants)):\n    next_person = participants[i]\n    next_free = free_intervals[next_person]\n    common_free = intersect_intervals(common_free, next_free)\n\nmeeting_start = None\nfor start, end in common_free:\n    if end - start >= 60:\n        meeting_start = start\n        break\n\nif meeting_start is None:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\nelse:\n    start_time_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_start)\n    end_time_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_start + 60)\n    print(f\"Monday {start_time_str}:{end_time_str}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `time_to_minutes` function converts time strings (like \"10:00\") into minutes since 9:00 (e.g., \"10:00\" becomes 60 minutes).\n2. **Free Intervals Calculation**: For each participant, their busy intervals are sorted by start time. The free intervals are computed as the gaps between these busy intervals within the 9:00-17:00 window (0 to 480 minutes).\n3. **Intersecting Free Intervals**: The `intersect_intervals` function finds overlapping free intervals across all participants by sequentially intersecting each participant's free intervals with the current common free intervals.\n4. **Finding a Suitable Slot**: The first common free interval of at least 60 minutes is selected. The start time and end time (start time + 60 minutes) are converted back to HH:MM format using `minutes_to_time`.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed in the format \"Monday HH:MM:HH:MM\", representing the day and the meeting start and end times (e.g., \"Monday 12:00:13:00\" for a meeting from 12:00 to 13:00).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the available time slots by leveraging interval arithmetic and ensures the solution meets all given constraints."
