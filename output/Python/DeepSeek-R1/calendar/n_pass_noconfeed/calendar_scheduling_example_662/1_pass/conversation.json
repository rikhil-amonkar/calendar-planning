In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Gary and David for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nGary has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 14:30 to 16:00; \nDavid has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a meeting between two participants, Gary and David, based on their existing schedules and constraints. The meeting must be scheduled within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on either Monday or Tuesday, and it should last for one hour (60 minutes). The solution involves analyzing the busy intervals of both participants, computing their available time slots, and finding the earliest overlapping slot that can accommodate the meeting duration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent all times in minutes from the start of the day (9:00 AM becomes 540 minutes, 5:00 PM becomes 1020 minutes) for easier calculations.\n2. **Define Busy Intervals**: For each day (Monday and Tuesday), define the busy intervals for both Gary and David based on their given schedules.\n3. **Compute Available Slots**: For each participant and each day, compute their available time slots by subtracting their busy intervals from the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n4. **Find Common Slots**: For each day, find overlapping available time slots between Gary and David that are at least 60 minutes long.\n5. **Select Earliest Slot**: The earliest such overlapping slot is chosen for the meeting. Convert the start and end times back to HH:MM format for output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef subtract_interval(intervals, to_remove):\n    new_intervals = []\n    r_start, r_end = to_remove\n    for start, end in intervals:\n        if end <= r_start or start >= r_end:\n            new_intervals.append((start, end))\n        else:\n            if r_start <= start and r_end >= end:\n                continue\n            elif r_start > start and r_end < end:\n                new_intervals.append((start, r_start))\n                new_intervals.append((r_end, end))\n            elif r_start <= start and r_end < end:\n                new_intervals.append((r_end, end))\n            elif r_start > start and r_end >= end:\n                new_intervals.append((start, r_start))\n    return new_intervals\n\ndef merge_avail(intervals1, intervals2):\n    intervals1_sorted = sorted(intervals1, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    intervals2_sorted = sorted(intervals2, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    i = j = 0\n    common = []\n    while i < len(intervals1_sorted) and j < len(intervals2_sorted):\n        a1, a2 = intervals1_sorted[i]\n        b1, b2 = intervals2_sorted[j]\n        low = max(a1, b1)\n        high = min(a2, b2)\n        if low < high:\n            common.append((low, high))\n        if a2 < b2:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    return common\n\ndef main():\n    work_start = 540  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 1020    # 17:00 in minutes\n    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday']\n    \n    gary_busy = {\n        'Monday': [(570, 600), (660, 780), (840, 870), (990, 1020)],\n        'Tuesday': [(540, 570), (630, 660), (870, 960)]\n    }\n    \n    david_busy = {\n        'Monday': [(540, 570), (600, 780), (870, 990)],\n        'Tuesday': [(540, 570), (600, 630), (660, 750), (780, 870), (900, 960), (990, 1020)]\n    }\n    \n    meeting_duration = 60  # minutes\n    result_day = None\n    result_time = None\n    \n    for day in days:\n        gary_avail = [(work_start, work_end)]\n        for busy in gary_busy[day]:\n            gary_avail = subtract_interval(gary_avail, busy)\n        \n        david_avail = [(work_start, work_end)]\n        for busy in david_busy[day]:\n            david_avail = subtract_interval(david_avail, busy)\n        \n        common_avail = merge_avail(gary_avail, david_avail)\n        for start, end in common_avail:\n            if end - start >= meeting_duration:\n                meeting_start = start\n                meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n                start_hour = meeting_start // 60\n                start_minute = meeting_start % 60\n                end_hour = meeting_end // 60\n                end_minute = meeting_end % 60\n                start_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n                end_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n                result_time = f\"{start_str}:{end_str}\"\n                result_day = day\n                break\n        if result_day:\n            break\n    \n    if result_day:\n        print(result_day)\n        print(result_time)\n    else:\n        print(\"No suitable time found\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The code converts all time values into minutes past midnight for simpler arithmetic operations. For example, 9:00 AM is 540 minutes.\n2. **Busy Intervals**: The busy intervals for Gary and David on Monday and Tuesday are predefined as lists of tuples, where each tuple represents a start and end time in minutes.\n3. **Available Slots Calculation**: For each day, the code calculates available time slots for each participant by subtracting their busy intervals from the work hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM). This is done using the `subtract_interval` function.\n4. **Finding Common Slots**: The `merge_avail` function identifies overlapping available time slots between Gary and David by comparing their sorted available intervals.\n5. **Meeting Scheduling**: The earliest overlapping slot of at least 60 minutes is selected. The start and end times of this slot are converted back to HH:MM format and printed along with the day of the week.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the available time slots for both participants, checks for overlaps, and selects the earliest suitable slot for the meeting, ensuring all constraints are met."
