In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michael, Eric and Arthur for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMichael has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nEric's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nArthur has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute time slot within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday that is free for all participants (Michael, Eric, and Arthur) based on their existing schedules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Translate all time points into minutes past 9:00 AM for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Aggregate Busy Intervals**: Collect all busy intervals from each participant's schedule.\n3. **Merge Overlapping Intervals**: Combine overlapping or adjacent busy intervals to simplify the search for free slots.\n4. **Identify Free Slots**: Calculate gaps between merged busy intervals and the working hours boundaries to find available slots.\n5. **Check Slot Duration**: Find the first free slot that can accommodate the 30-minute meeting.\n6. **Convert Back to Time Format**: Translate the identified slot from minutes back to HH:MM format for output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return (hours - 9) * 60 + minutes\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    total_minutes = minutes + 9 * 60\n    hours = total_minutes // 60\n    minutes = total_minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Convert work hours to minutes\n    work_start = time_to_minutes(\"09:00\")  # 0 minutes\n    work_end = time_to_minutes(\"17:00\")    # 480 minutes\n    \n    # Collect all busy intervals in minutes\n    busy_intervals = []\n    \n    # Michael's busy times\n    michael_meetings = [\n        (\"09:30\", \"10:30\"),\n        (\"15:00\", \"15:30\"),\n        (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")\n    ]\n    for start, end in michael_meetings:\n        s = time_to_minutes(start)\n        e = time_to_minutes(end)\n        busy_intervals.append((s, e))\n    \n    # Eric has no meetings, so no intervals to add\n    \n    # Arthur's busy times\n    arthur_meetings = [\n        (\"09:00\", \"12:00\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"15:00\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"16:00\"),\n        (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ]\n    for start, end in arthur_meetings:\n        s = time_to_minutes(start)\n        e = time_to_minutes(end)\n        busy_intervals.append((s, e))\n    \n    # Sort intervals by start time\n    busy_intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    # Merge overlapping or adjacent intervals\n    merged = []\n    if busy_intervals:\n        current_start, current_end = busy_intervals[0]\n        for interval in busy_intervals[1:]:\n            if interval[0] <= current_end:\n                current_end = max(current_end, interval[1])\n            else:\n                merged.append((current_start, current_end))\n                current_start, current_end = interval\n        merged.append((current_start, current_end))\n    \n    # Find free intervals within work hours\n    free_intervals = []\n    if not merged:\n        free_intervals.append((work_start, work_end))\n    else:\n        # Before first meeting\n        if merged[0][0] > work_start:\n            free_intervals.append((work_start, merged[0][0]))\n        # Between meetings\n        for i in range(1, len(merged)):\n            prev_end = merged[i-1][1]\n            curr_start = merged[i][0]\n            if curr_start > prev_end:\n                free_intervals.append((prev_end, curr_start))\n        # After last meeting\n        if merged[-1][1] < work_end:\n            free_intervals.append((merged[-1][1], work_end))\n    \n    # Find the first free slot of at least 30 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    for start, end in free_intervals:\n        if end - start >= meeting_duration:\n            meeting_start = start\n            meeting_end = start + meeting_duration\n            # Format as HH:MM:HH:MM and day\n            start_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_start)\n            end_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n            print(f\"Monday:{start_str}:{end_str}\")\n            return\n    \n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No suitable time found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `time_to_minutes` function converts HH:MM times into minutes past 9:00 AM, and `minutes_to_time` converts minutes back to HH:MM format.\n2. **Busy Intervals Collection**: Each participant's busy intervals are converted into minutes and stored in a list.\n3. **Merging Intervals**: The busy intervals are sorted by start time and merged if they overlap or are adjacent to form a non-overlapping list.\n4. **Free Slots Calculation**: The gaps between merged busy intervals and the boundaries of the working hours are identified as free slots.\n5. **Slot Selection**: The first free slot that is at least 30 minutes long is selected. The start and end times of this slot are converted back to HH:MM format and printed along with the day (Monday).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the available time slots by leveraging interval merging and gap analysis, ensuring optimal performance even with more complex schedules."
