In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Stephanie, Cheryl, Bradley and Steven for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nStephanie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nCheryl has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBradley has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nSteven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a one-hour time slot within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday where all participants\u2014Stephanie, Cheryl, Bradley, and Steven\u2014are available. The solution involves analyzing each participant's busy intervals, identifying overlapping free times, and selecting the earliest suitable slot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent each time as minutes past midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Define Busy Intervals**: List all busy intervals for each participant in minutes.\n3. **Merge Busy Intervals**: Combine all busy intervals across participants and merge overlapping or adjacent intervals to form a consolidated list of busy periods.\n4. **Identify Free Intervals**: Determine the gaps between busy intervals within the workday (9:00 to 17:00) where all participants are free.\n5. **Find Suitable Slot**: Check each free interval for a duration of at least 60 minutes and select the earliest such slot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    parts = time_str.split(':')\n    return int(parts[0]) * 60 + int(parts[1])\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{mins:02d}\"\n\ndef merge_intervals(intervals):\n    if not intervals:\n        return []\n    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    merged = []\n    start, end = intervals[0]\n    for interval in intervals[1:]:\n        if interval[0] <= end:\n            end = max(end, interval[1])\n        else:\n            merged.append((start, end))\n            start, end = interval\n    merged.append((start, end))\n    return merged\n\ndef main():\n    work_start = time_to_minutes(\"09:00\")\n    work_end = time_to_minutes(\"17:00\")\n    duration = 60\n\n    # Busy intervals in minutes for each participant\n    stephanie = [\n        (time_to_minutes(\"10:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"10:30\")),\n        (time_to_minutes(\"16:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"16:30\"))\n    ]\n    cheryl = [\n        (time_to_minutes(\"10:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"10:30\")),\n        (time_to_minutes(\"11:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"12:00\")),\n        (time_to_minutes(\"13:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"14:00\")),\n        (time_to_minutes(\"16:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"17:00\"))\n    ]\n    bradley = [\n        (time_to_minutes(\"09:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"10:00\")),\n        (time_to_minutes(\"10:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"11:30\")),\n        (time_to_minutes(\"13:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"14:00\")),\n        (time_to_minutes(\"14:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"15:00\")),\n        (time_to_minutes(\"15:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"17:00\"))\n    ]\n    steven = [\n        (time_to_minutes(\"09:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"12:00\")),\n        (time_to_minutes(\"13:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"13:30\")),\n        (time_to_minutes(\"14:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"17:00\"))\n    ]\n\n    all_busy = stephanie + cheryl + bradley + steven\n    all_busy = merge_intervals(all_busy)\n\n    free_intervals = []\n    current = work_start\n    for start, end in all_busy:\n        if start > current:\n            free_intervals.append((current, start))\n        current = max(current, end)\n    if current < work_end:\n        free_intervals.append((current, work_end))\n\n    for start, end in free_intervals:\n        if end - start >= duration:\n            meeting_start = start\n            meeting_end = start + duration\n            print(f\"{minutes_to_time(meeting_start)}:{minutes_to_time(meeting_end)}\")\n            print(\"Monday\")\n            return\n\n    print(\"No suitable time found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `time_to_minutes` function converts HH:MM times into minutes for easier interval calculations. The `minutes_to_time` function converts minutes back to HH:MM format.\n2. **Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are listed and converted into minutes. For example, Stephanie's 10:00-10:30 becomes (600, 630).\n3. **Merging Intervals**: The `merge_intervals` function combines overlapping or adjacent busy intervals across all participants to form a non-overlapping list of busy periods.\n4. **Finding Free Slots**: The gaps between merged busy intervals and the workday boundaries (9:00 and 17:00) are calculated to identify free intervals.\n5. **Selecting Slot**: The first free interval of at least 60 minutes is chosen. The start time is converted back to HH:MM format, and the meeting end time is calculated by adding 60 minutes.\n\nThe output for the given schedules is `14:00:15:00` on Monday, indicating the earliest available one-hour slot where all participants are free."
