In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Anthony, Pamela and Zachary for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAnthony has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nPamela is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nZachary has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nPamela do not want to meet on Monday after 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a one-hour meeting between three participants (Anthony, Pamela, and Zachary) within their available working hours on Monday, considering their existing schedules and constraints. The solution involves determining free time intervals for each participant, finding the common free intervals among all participants, and selecting the earliest slot that accommodates the meeting duration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: For ease of calculation, convert all time values (start and end of meetings, working hours) into minutes from the start of the day (9:00 AM is 540 minutes).\n2. **Define Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are predefined and converted into minutes.\n3. **Compute Free Intervals**: For each participant, compute the free intervals within their available working hours by subtracting their busy intervals from their working window.\n4. **Intersect Free Intervals**: Find common free intervals by intersecting the free intervals of all three participants.\n5. **Find Suitable Meeting Slot**: From the common free intervals, select the first interval that is at least 60 minutes long. The meeting will be scheduled at the start of this interval for one hour.\n6. **Convert Back to Time Format**: Convert the selected start and end times (in minutes) back to the HH:MM format and output the result along with the day of the week.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_free_intervals(busy_intervals, window):\n    start_min, end_min = window\n    if not busy_intervals:\n        return [(start_min, end_min)]\n    sorted_busy = sorted(busy_intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    free = []\n    current_start = start_min\n    for interval in sorted_busy:\n        if interval[0] > current_start:\n            free.append((current_start, interval[0]))\n        if interval[1] > current_start:\n            current_start = interval[1]\n        if current_start >= end_min:\n            break\n    if current_start < end_min:\n        free.append((current_start, end_min))\n    return free\n\ndef intersect_intervals(intervals1, intervals2):\n    result = []\n    for start1, end1 in intervals1:\n        for start2, end2 in intervals2:\n            start_max = max(start1, start2)\n            end_min = min(end1, end2)\n            if start_max < end_min:\n                result.append((start_max, end_min))\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    anthony_busy = [(570, 600), (720, 780), (960, 990)]\n    pamela_busy = [(570, 600), (990, 1020)]\n    zachary_busy = [(540, 690), (720, 750), (780, 810), (870, 900), (960, 1020)]\n    \n    anthony_window = (540, 1020)\n    pamela_window = (540, 870)\n    zachary_window = (540, 1020)\n    \n    anthony_free = compute_free_intervals(anthony_busy, anthony_window)\n    pamela_free = compute_free_intervals(pamela_busy, pamela_window)\n    zachary_free = compute_free_intervals(zachary_busy, zachary_window)\n    \n    common_free = intersect_intervals(anthony_free, pamela_free)\n    common_free = intersect_intervals(common_free, zachary_free)\n    \n    meeting_start = None\n    meeting_end = None\n    for start, end in common_free:\n        if end - start >= 60:\n            meeting_start = start\n            meeting_end = start + 60\n            break\n    \n    def format_time(minutes):\n        hour = minutes // 60\n        minute = minutes % 60\n        return f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}\"\n    \n    start_str = format_time(meeting_start)\n    end_str = format_time(meeting_end)\n    time_range_str = f\"{start_str}:{end_str}\"\n    \n    print(\"Monday\", time_range_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The script starts by converting all time values into minutes for easier arithmetic operations. For example, 9:00 AM is represented as 540 minutes.\n2. **Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are predefined in minutes. For instance, Anthony's first meeting from 9:30 to 10:00 is stored as (570, 600).\n3. **Free Intervals Calculation**: The function `compute_free_intervals` calculates the free time slots for each participant by subtracting their busy intervals from their working window (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM for Anthony and Zachary, and 9:00 AM to 2:30 PM for Pamela).\n4. **Common Free Intervals**: The function `intersect_intervals` finds overlapping free intervals among all three participants by pairwise intersection of their free intervals.\n5. **Meeting Slot Selection**: The earliest common free interval of at least 60 minutes is selected. The meeting is scheduled to start at the beginning of this interval.\n6. **Output**: The selected start and end times are converted back to HH:MM format and printed along with the day of the week (Monday).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the available time slots by leveraging interval arithmetic and ensures the meeting fits within all participants' constraints and schedules."
