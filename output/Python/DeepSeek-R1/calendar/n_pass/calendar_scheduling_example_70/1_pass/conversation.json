In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Denise, Angela and Natalie for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDenise has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nAngelahas no meetings the whole day.\nNatalie is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the earliest available time slot for a meeting that fits within the work hours and accommodates all participants' existing schedules. The solution involves analyzing the busy intervals of each participant, merging overlapping intervals, and then identifying the earliest free interval that can accommodate the meeting duration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert all time strings (like \"9:00\") into minutes since a reference point (here, 9:00 AM) for easier calculations.\n2. **Collect Busy Intervals**: Gather all busy intervals for each participant and store them in a list.\n3. **Merge Busy Intervals**: Sort the busy intervals by their start time and merge any overlapping intervals to form a consolidated list of periods where at least one participant is busy.\n4. **Find Free Intervals**: Compute the free intervals by examining the gaps between the merged busy intervals within the work hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM).\n5. **Identify Suitable Slot**: Traverse the free intervals to find the first interval that is at least as long as the meeting duration (30 minutes). The meeting will be scheduled at the start of this interval.\n6. **Convert Back to Time Strings**: Convert the start and end times of the meeting slot back to the HH:MM format and output the result along with the day of the week.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    parts = time_str.split(':')\n    hour = int(parts[0])\n    minute = int(parts[1])\n    return (hour - 9) * 60 + minute\n\ndef minutes_to_time(total_minutes):\n    hour = 9 + total_minutes // 60\n    minute = total_minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}\"\n\ndef main():\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n    work_end_minutes = 8 * 60  # 17:00 is 8 hours after 9:00\n\n    busy_intervals = []\n    \n    # Denise's busy intervals\n    busy_intervals.append([time_to_minutes(\"12:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"12:30\")])\n    busy_intervals.append([time_to_minutes(\"15:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"16:00\")])\n    \n    # Natalie's busy intervals\n    busy_intervals.append([time_to_minutes(\"9:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"11:30\")])\n    busy_intervals.append([time_to_minutes(\"12:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"13:00\")])\n    busy_intervals.append([time_to_minutes(\"14:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"14:30\")])\n    busy_intervals.append([time_to_minutes(\"15:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"17:00\")])\n    \n    # Angela has no meetings, so no intervals to add\n    \n    if busy_intervals:\n        busy_intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        merged = []\n        start, end = busy_intervals[0]\n        for i in range(1, len(busy_intervals)):\n            s, e = busy_intervals[i]\n            if s <= end:\n                end = max(end, e)\n            else:\n                merged.append([start, end])\n                start, end = s, e\n        merged.append([start, end])\n    else:\n        merged = []\n    \n    free_intervals = []\n    current = 0\n    for interval in merged:\n        s, e = interval\n        if current < s:\n            free_intervals.append([current, s])\n        current = e\n    if current < work_end_minutes:\n        free_intervals.append([current, work_end_minutes])\n    \n    meeting_time = None\n    for interval in free_intervals:\n        start_min, end_min = interval\n        if end_min - start_min >= meeting_duration:\n            meeting_start = start_min\n            meeting_end = start_min + meeting_duration\n            meeting_time = (meeting_start, meeting_end)\n            break\n    \n    if meeting_time is None:\n        print(\"No suitable time found\")\n    else:\n        start_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_time[0])\n        end_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_time[1])\n        time_range_str = f\"{start_str}:{end_str}\"\n        print(\"Monday\")\n        print(time_range_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `time_to_minutes` function converts a time string (e.g., \"12:00\") into minutes since 9:00 AM. The `minutes_to_time` function reverses this process.\n2. **Busy Intervals Handling**: Busy intervals for each participant are collected in a list. For example, Denise's busy intervals are 12:00-12:30 and 15:30-16:00.\n3. **Merging Intervals**: The busy intervals are sorted by start time and merged if they overlap. This ensures we have non-overlapping periods where at least one participant is busy.\n4. **Free Intervals Calculation**: The gaps between merged busy intervals and the work hours boundaries (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM) are calculated to find free intervals.\n5. **Finding Meeting Slot**: The first free interval that can accommodate the 30-minute meeting is selected. The meeting starts at the beginning of this interval.\n6. **Output**: The meeting start and end times are converted back to HH:MM format and printed along with the day (\"Monday\"). For the given schedules, the earliest available slot is 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM."
