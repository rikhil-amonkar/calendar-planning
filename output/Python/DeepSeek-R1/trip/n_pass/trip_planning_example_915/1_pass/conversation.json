You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 3 days. You want to spend 5 days in Venice.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting 7 European cities over 26 days, considering specific constraints such as fixed durations in each city, event dates, and direct flight connections between cities. The solution involves determining the sequence of cities that satisfies all constraints and calculating the day ranges for each stay.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting 7 cities (Bucharest, Venice, Prague, Frankfurt, Zurich, Florence, Tallinn) over 26 days with specific constraints:\n   - Fixed durations for each city (e.g., 3 days in Bucharest, 5 days in Venice).\n   - Event constraints: Wedding in Venice between days 22-26, annual show in Frankfurt from days 12-16, and meeting friends in Tallinn between days 8-12.\n   - Direct flight connections between certain cities (provided as a list).\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Travel Days**: When traveling from city A to city B on day X, day X is counted in both cities. This affects the total days spent in each city.\n   - **Event Constraints**: Frankfurt must be visited from day 12 to 16 to attend the annual show. Venice must include at least one day between 22-26 for the wedding. Tallinn must include at least one day between 8-12 to meet friends.\n   - **Flight Connections**: The itinerary must only use direct flights between consecutive cities.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Segmented Itinerary**: The itinerary is divided into segments:\n     - **Before Frankfurt**: Cities visited before day 12.\n     - **Frankfurt**: Fixed from day 12 to 16.\n     - **After Frankfurt**: Cities visited after day 16.\n   - **Day Calculation**: For each segment, compute the start and end days of each city stay based on durations and travel days (where the end day of one city is the start day of the next city).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves a fixed sequence of cities with predefined durations. The day calculations are linear in the number of cities, making the approach efficient (O(1) for fixed inputs).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    segments = [\n        [(\"Florence\", 5), (\"Prague\", 4), (\"Tallinn\", 5)],\n        [(\"Frankfurt\", 5)],\n        [(\"Bucharest\", 3), (\"Zurich\", 5), (\"Venice\", 5)]\n    ]\n    \n    current_day = 1\n    itinerary_list = []\n    \n    for segment in segments:\n        for (city, duration) in segment:\n            start = current_day\n            end = start + duration - 1\n            if start == end:\n                day_range_str = f\"Day {start}\"\n            else:\n                day_range_str = f\"Day {start}-{end}\"\n            itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": city})\n            current_day = end\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Segments**: The itinerary is divided into three segments:\n   - **First Segment (Days 1-12)**: Visits Florence (5 days), Prague (4 days), and Tallinn (5 days). This segment ensures Tallinn includes days 8-12 to meet friends.\n   - **Second Segment (Days 12-16)**: Frankfurt is visited for exactly 5 days to cover the annual show.\n   - **Third Segment (Days 16-26)**: Visits Bucharest (3 days), Zurich (5 days), and Venice (5 days). Venice's stay ends on day 26, covering the wedding dates.\n\n2. **Day Calculation**:\n   - **Florence**: Starts on day 1, ends on day 5 (duration: 5 days).\n   - **Prague**: Starts on day 5 (same as Florence's end day), ends on day 8 (duration: 4 days).\n   - **Tallinn**: Starts on day 8, ends on day 12 (duration: 5 days).\n   - **Frankfurt**: Starts on day 12, ends on day 16 (duration: 5 days).\n   - **Bucharest**: Starts on day 16, ends on day 18 (duration: 3 days).\n   - **Zurich**: Starts on day 18, ends on day 22 (duration: 5 days).\n   - **Venice**: Starts on day 22, ends on day 26 (duration: 5 days).\n\n3. **Output**: The itinerary is printed as a JSON object with day ranges and corresponding cities, ensuring all constraints are met. The travel days are implicitly handled by overlapping the end day of one city with the start day of the next."
