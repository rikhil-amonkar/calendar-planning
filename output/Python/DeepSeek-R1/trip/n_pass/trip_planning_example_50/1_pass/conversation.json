        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal itinerary for visiting three European cities (Vilnius, Munich, and Mykonos) over 12 days, adhering to specific constraints on the number of days spent in each city and the availability of direct flights between them. The solution involves determining a valid sequence of cities based on flight connections and then calculating the day ranges for each stay, considering that travel days are counted in both the departing and arriving cities.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting three cities (Vilnius, Munich, Mykonos) for a total of 12 days, with specific days allocated to each city (4 days in Vilnius, 3 in Munich, and 7 in Mykonos). Direct flights are available from Vilnius to Munich (unidirectional) and between Munich and Mykonos (bidirectional). The challenge is to find a valid sequence of cities such that consecutive cities in the sequence have a direct flight connection.\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the flight connections as a directed graph where each node is a city, and edges represent direct flights. For example:\n   - Vilnius \u2192 Munich (unidirectional)\n   - Munich \u2194 Mykonos (bidirectional)\n3. **Permutation Check**: Generate all permutations of the three cities and check each permutation to find a valid sequence where each consecutive city pair has a direct flight in the required direction.\n4. **Day Range Calculation**: For the valid city sequence, calculate the day ranges for each stay. The start day of each subsequent city is the end day of the previous city (since travel days are shared between cities). The day range for each city is computed as `start_day` to `start_day + days_in_city - 1`.\n5. **Output**: Construct a JSON-formatted dictionary containing the itinerary with day ranges for each city.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 12\n    city_days = {\n        \"Vilnius\": 4,\n        \"Munich\": 3,\n        \"Mykonos\": 7\n    }\n    \n    graph = {\n        \"Vilnius\": [\"Munich\"],\n        \"Munich\": [\"Mykonos\"],\n        \"Mykonos\": [\"Munich\"]\n    }\n    \n    cities = list(city_days.keys())\n    perms = permutations(cities)\n    found_order = None\n    \n    for perm in perms:\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(len(perm) - 1):\n            from_city = perm[i]\n            to_city = perm[i+1]\n            if to_city not in graph.get(from_city, []):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            found_order = perm\n            break\n            \n    if found_order is None:\n        result = {\"itinerary\": []}\n        print(json.dumps(result))\n        return\n        \n    current_start = 1\n    itinerary_list = []\n    for city in found_order:\n        num_days = city_days[city]\n        end_day = current_start + num_days - 1\n        itinerary_list.append({\n            \"day_range\": f\"Day {current_start}-{end_day}\",\n            \"place\": city\n        })\n        current_start = end_day\n        \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Setup**: The flight connections are represented in a directed graph where each key is a city, and its value is a list of cities reachable via direct flights.\n2. **Permutation Check**: The code generates all possible permutations of the three cities. For each permutation, it checks if consecutive cities have a direct flight from the first to the second city using the graph.\n3. **Valid Sequence**: The first valid sequence found (Vilnius \u2192 Munich \u2192 Mykonos) is used for itinerary planning.\n4. **Day Calculation**: The start day for each city is set to the end day of the previous city. The end day for the current city is calculated as `start_day + days_in_city - 1`. For example:\n   - Vilnius: Days 1-4 (4 days)\n   - Munich: Days 4-6 (3 days, with Day 4 shared with Vilnius and Day 6 shared with Mykonos)\n   - Mykonos: Days 6-12 (7 days)\n5. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON dictionary with day ranges for each city, printed as the final output.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for valid city sequences based on flight connections and calculates the day ranges while accounting for shared travel days, ensuring the solution meets all given constraints."
