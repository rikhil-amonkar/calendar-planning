        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal itinerary for visiting five European cities over 23 days, considering direct flight connections and specific constraints for each city. The constraints include fixed durations for each city stay and specific date ranges for certain cities. The solution involves generating a sequence of city visits that adheres to these constraints and direct flight availability.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting Geneva, Porto, Paris, Reykjavik, and Oslo over 23 days. Specific constraints include:\n   - Geneva must be visited from day 1 to day 7.\n   - Oslo must be visited from day 19 to day 23.\n   - Each city has a fixed duration: Paris (6 days), Oslo (5 days), Porto (7 days), Geneva (7 days), and Reykjavik (2 days).\n   - Direct flights between cities are given, and travel days count towards stays in both departure and arrival cities.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The total \"city-days\" (sum of days spent in each city, counting travel days in both cities) is 27 (23 calendar days plus 4 travel days). Geneva and Oslo are fixed at the start and end, respectively. The middle cities (Porto, Paris, Reykjavik) must fit into the remaining days (day 7 to day 19) with their respective durations.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Permutation Check**: Generate all permutations of the middle cities (Porto, Paris, Reykjavik) to find a valid sequence where each consecutive city pair has a direct flight, and the sequence ends with a direct flight to Oslo.\n   - **Duration Validation**: For each valid permutation, calculate the start and end days of each city stay ensuring the total duration matches the constraints and the sequence ends on day 19 to start Oslo on day 19.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: With only 3 middle cities, there are 6 permutations (3!), making the solution feasible without optimization. The direct flight checks are constant time operations per permutation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef format_day_range(start, end):\n    if start == end:\n        return f\"Day {start}\"\n    else:\n        return f\"Day {start}-{end}\"\n\ndef main():\n    graph = {\n        'Paris': ['Oslo', 'Porto', 'Geneva', 'Reykjavik'],\n        'Oslo': ['Paris', 'Geneva', 'Porto', 'Reykjavik'],\n        'Porto': ['Paris', 'Geneva', 'Oslo'],\n        'Geneva': ['Paris', 'Oslo', 'Porto'],\n        'Reykjavik': ['Paris', 'Oslo']\n    }\n    \n    required_durations = {\n        'Paris': 6,\n        'Porto': 7,\n        'Reykjavik': 2\n    }\n    \n    middle_cities = ['Paris', 'Porto', 'Reykjavik']\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(middle_cities):\n        A, B, C = perm\n        if A in graph['Geneva'] and B in graph[A] and C in graph[B] and 'Oslo' in graph[C]:\n            d1 = required_durations[A]\n            d2 = required_durations[B]\n            d3 = required_durations[C]\n            if d1 + d2 + d3 != 15:\n                continue\n                \n            s1 = 7\n            e1 = s1 + d1 - 1\n            s2 = e1\n            e2 = s2 + d2 - 1\n            s3 = e2\n            e3 = s3 + d3 - 1\n            \n            if e3 != 19:\n                continue\n                \n            itinerary = []\n            itinerary.append({'day_range': format_day_range(1, 7), 'place': 'Geneva'})\n            itinerary.append({'day_range': format_day_range(s1, e1), 'place': A})\n            itinerary.append({'day_range': format_day_range(s2, e2), 'place': B})\n            itinerary.append({'day_range': format_day_range(s3, e3), 'place': C})\n            itinerary.append({'day_range': format_day_range(19, 23), 'place': 'Oslo'})\n            \n            print(json.dumps({'itinerary': itinerary}, indent=None))\n            return\n            \n    print(json.dumps({'itinerary': []}))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Definition**: The `graph` dictionary represents direct flight connections between cities. Each city maps to a list of cities it has direct flights to.\n2. **Duration Constraints**: The `required_durations` dictionary specifies the number of days to spend in each middle city (Paris, Porto, Reykjavik).\n3. **Permutation Check**: The code generates all permutations of the middle cities. For each permutation, it checks if consecutive cities have direct flights and if the last city connects to Oslo.\n4. **Duration Validation**: For valid permutations, the start and end days of each city stay are calculated. The sequence must end on day 19 to start Oslo on day 19.\n5. **Output**: The itinerary is built as a list of dictionaries, each specifying the day range and city. The result is printed in JSON format.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible sequences of city visits, ensuring constraints are met and the itinerary is optimal based on direct flight availability."
