You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Tallinn for 2 days. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 4 days.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal itinerary for visiting 6 European cities over 18 days, adhering to specific constraints on the duration of stays in each city, event timelines, and direct flight connections between cities. The solution involves generating valid permutations of the cities that respect the flight connections and then checking if the itinerary fits within the 18-day window while satisfying all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting 6 cities (Bucharest, Munich, Seville, Milan, Stockholm, Tallinn) over 18 days. Each city has a fixed duration of stay, and certain cities have event constraints that must be met within specific day ranges. Direct flights between cities are provided, and the itinerary must use these flights for transitions.\n2. **Key Constraints**:\n   - **Duration Constraints**: Each city must be visited for a fixed number of days (Bucharest: 4 days, Munich: 5 days, Seville: 5 days, Milan: 2 days, Stockholm: 5 days, Tallinn: 2 days).\n   - **Event Constraints**: \n     - Bucharest must be visited between days 1 and 4.\n     - Munich must be visited between days 4 and 8.\n     - Seville must be visited between days 8 and 12.\n   - **Flight Constraints**: Travel between cities must be via direct flights as specified.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Permutation Generation**: Generate all permutations of the 6 cities to explore possible visitation orders.\n   - **Path Validation**: For each permutation, check if consecutive cities have direct flights.\n   - **Day Calculation**: For valid paths, calculate start and end days for each city stay, ensuring the total days do not exceed 18.\n   - **Event Validation**: Verify that the event constraints for Bucharest, Munich, and Seville are satisfied within their respective day ranges.\n4. **Output**: Once a valid itinerary is found, format the result as a JSON object listing each city with its corresponding day range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    cities = ['Bucharest', 'Munich', 'Seville', 'Milan', 'Stockholm', 'Tallinn']\n    durations = {\n        'Bucharest': 4,\n        'Munich': 5,\n        'Seville': 5,\n        'Milan': 2,\n        'Stockholm': 5,\n        'Tallinn': 2\n    }\n    events = {\n        'Bucharest': (1, 4),\n        'Munich': (4, 8),\n        'Seville': (8, 12)\n    }\n    graph = {\n        'Milan': ['Stockholm', 'Munich', 'Seville'],\n        'Munich': ['Milan', 'Stockholm', 'Bucharest', 'Seville', 'Tallinn'],\n        'Bucharest': ['Munich'],\n        'Seville': ['Munich', 'Milan'],\n        'Stockholm': ['Milan', 'Munich', 'Tallinn'],\n        'Tallinn': ['Stockholm', 'Munich']\n    }\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(cities):\n        valid_path = True\n        for i in range(len(perm)-1):\n            if perm[i+1] not in graph[perm[i]]:\n                valid_path = False\n                break\n        if not valid_path:\n            continue\n            \n        starts = [0] * len(perm)\n        ends = [0] * len(perm)\n        starts[0] = 1\n        ends[0] = starts[0] + durations[perm[0]] - 1\n        for i in range(1, len(perm)):\n            starts[i] = ends[i-1]\n            ends[i] = starts[i] + durations[perm[i]] - 1\n        \n        if ends[-1] > 18:\n            continue\n            \n        event_ok = True\n        for city, (low, high) in events.items():\n            if city in perm:\n                idx = perm.index(city)\n                s = starts[idx]\n                e = ends[idx]\n                if not (s <= high and e >= low):\n                    event_ok = False\n                    break\n            else:\n                event_ok = False\n                break\n                \n        if not event_ok:\n            continue\n            \n        itinerary_list = []\n        for i in range(len(perm)):\n            s = starts[i]\n            e = ends[i]\n            if s == e:\n                day_range_str = f\"Day {s}\"\n            else:\n                day_range_str = f\"Day {s}-{e}\"\n            itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": perm[i]})\n        \n        result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n        print(json.dumps(result))\n        return\n    \n    print(json.dumps({\"itinerary\": []}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The cities, their respective stay durations, event constraints, and direct flight connections are defined.\n2. **Permutation Generation**: All possible permutations of the cities are generated to explore every possible visitation order.\n3. **Path Validation**: For each permutation, the code checks if consecutive cities are connected by direct flights. If not, the permutation is skipped.\n4. **Day Calculation**: For valid paths, the start and end days for each city stay are calculated. The travel day between cities is considered part of both stays.\n5. **Event Validation**: The code checks if the stays in Bucharest, Munich, and Seville overlap with their respective event day ranges (1-4, 4-8, and 8-12).\n6. **Output**: The first valid itinerary found is formatted into a JSON object, listing each city with its day range. If no valid itinerary is found, an empty itinerary is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that the itinerary meets all given constraints while efficiently exploring possible paths through systematic permutation checks."
