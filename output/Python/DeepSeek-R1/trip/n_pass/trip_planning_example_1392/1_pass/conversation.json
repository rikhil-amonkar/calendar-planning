You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 3 days in Naples. You want to meet a friend in Naples between day 18 and day 20. You plan to stay in Valencia for 5 days. You plan to stay in Stuttgart for 2 days. You would like to visit Split for 5 days. You want to spend 5 days in Venice. During day 6 and day 10, you have to attend a conference in Venice. You plan to stay in Amsterdam for 4 days. You plan to stay in Nice for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Nice between day 23 and day 24 to tour together. You want to spend 2 days in Barcelona. You have to attend a workshop in Barcelona between day 5 and day 6. You want to spend 4 days in Porto.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nVenice and Nice, Naples and Amsterdam, Barcelona and Nice, Amsterdam and Nice, Stuttgart and Valencia, Stuttgart and Porto, Split and Stuttgart, Split and Naples, Valencia and Amsterdam, Barcelona and Porto, Valencia and Naples, Venice and Amsterdam, Barcelona and Naples, Barcelona and Valencia, Split and Amsterdam, Barcelona and Venice, Stuttgart and Amsterdam, Naples and Nice, Venice and Stuttgart, Split and Barcelona, Porto and Nice, Barcelona and Stuttgart, Venice and Naples, Porto and Amsterdam, Porto and Valencia, Stuttgart and Naples, Barcelona and Amsterdam.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 24 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
