        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal itinerary for visiting 6 European cities over 18 days, considering direct flight connections and specific constraints on the duration of stay in each city. The solution involves finding a valid sequence of cities connected by direct flights, ensuring the stay in Porto falls within the specified days (16-18), and calculating the day ranges for each city stay.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting 6 cities (Helsinki, Valencia, Dubrovnik, Porto, Prague, Reykjavik) over 18 days with specific stay durations. Direct flights between cities are given, and the itinerary must start and end such that consecutive cities are connected by direct flights. Additionally, Porto must be visited between days 16 and 18.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: \n   - Porto must be the last city because it only connects to Valencia, and after visiting Porto, no further flights are possible.\n   - Valencia must precede Porto since it's the only city connected to Porto.\n   - Prague must precede Valencia because it's the only city (besides Porto) connected to Valencia.\n   - The remaining cities (Dubrovnik, Helsinki, Reykjavik) must form a path ending in a city connected to Prague (either Helsinki or Reykjavik).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Graph Representation**: Represent cities and direct flights as an adjacency list.\n   - **Permutations**: Generate permutations of the first three cities (Dubrovnik, Helsinki, Reykjavik) to find valid paths that connect to Prague.\n   - **Day Calculation**: For the valid city sequence, compute day ranges where each city stay starts on the end day of the previous city (accounting for flight days).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - The permutations of three cities result in 6 combinations, each checked in constant time for path validity and connection to Prague.\n   - The overall complexity is O(1) due to fixed constraints (6 cities).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    graph = {\n        'Helsinki': ['Prague', 'Reykjavik', 'Dubrovnik'],\n        'Prague': ['Helsinki', 'Valencia', 'Reykjavik'],\n        'Valencia': ['Prague', 'Porto'],\n        'Porto': ['Valencia'],\n        'Reykjavik': ['Helsinki', 'Prague'],\n        'Dubrovnik': ['Helsinki']\n    }\n    \n    days_map = {\n        'Helsinki': 4,\n        'Valencia': 5,\n        'Dubrovnik': 4,\n        'Porto': 3,\n        'Prague': 3,\n        'Reykjavik': 4\n    }\n    \n    fixed_tail = ['Prague', 'Valencia', 'Porto']\n    all_cities = list(days_map.keys())\n    head_cities = [city for city in all_cities if city not in fixed_tail]\n    \n    candidates = []\n    for perm in permutations(head_cities):\n        valid_path = True\n        for i in range(len(perm) - 1):\n            if perm[i+1] not in graph[perm[i]]:\n                valid_path = False\n                break\n        if valid_path and perm[-1] in graph['Prague']:\n            full_path = list(perm) + fixed_tail\n            candidates.append(full_path)\n    \n    if candidates:\n        candidate_path = candidates[0]\n    else:\n        candidate_path = ['Dubrovnik', 'Helsinki', 'Reykjavik', 'Prague', 'Valencia', 'Porto']\n    \n    start_day = 1\n    itinerary_list = []\n    for city in candidate_path:\n        end_day = start_day + days_map[city] - 1\n        day_range_str = f\"Day {start_day}-{end_day}\"\n        itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": city})\n        start_day = end_day\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Representation**: The `graph` dictionary maps each city to its directly connected cities, representing available direct flights.\n2. **Stay Durations**: The `days_map` dictionary specifies the number of days to spend in each city.\n3. **Fixed Tail**: The last three cities (Prague, Valencia, Porto) are fixed due to flight constraints.\n4. **Permutations Check**: The code generates permutations of the first three cities (Dubrovnik, Helsinki, Reykjavik) to find valid paths that connect to Prague.\n5. **Day Calculation**: For the valid city sequence, the start day of each city is the end day of the previous city. The day ranges are computed and stored in the itinerary list.\n6. **Output**: The itinerary is printed as a JSON object with day ranges and corresponding cities.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal itinerary by leveraging graph connectivity constraints and permutation checks, ensuring all given conditions are met."
