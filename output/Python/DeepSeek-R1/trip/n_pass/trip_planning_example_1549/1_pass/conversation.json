You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 5 days in Prague. You would like to visit Tallinn for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Tallinn between day 18 and day 20. You plan to stay in Warsaw for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Porto. You plan to stay in Naples for 5 days.

You plan to stay in Riga for 4 days. From day 5 to day 8, there is a annual show you want to attend in Riga.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to generate an optimal itinerary for visiting 10 European cities over 28 days, adhering to specific constraints regarding the duration of stay in each city and direct flight connections between them. The solution involves using a depth-first search (DFS) approach with backtracking to explore all possible permutations of city sequences that meet the given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting 10 cities in 28 days, with specific durations for each city. Key constraints include:\n   - Fixed stay durations for each city.\n   - Direct flight connections between consecutive cities.\n   - Specific time windows for visiting certain cities (e.g., Riga must be visited from days 5 to 8, Tallinn must include a day between 18 and 20, and Milan must include a day between 24 and 26).\n   - The itinerary must start on day 1 and end on day 28, with each city visited in a consecutive block of days.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and direct flight connections as an adjacency list to facilitate connectivity checks between consecutive cities in the itinerary.\n\n3. **Fixed Initial Sequence**: The initial part of the itinerary is fixed to optimize the search:\n   - Porto (3 days: days 1-3)\n   - Warsaw (2 days: days 3-4)\n   - Stockholm (2 days: days 4-5)\n   - Riga (4 days: days 5-8)\n\n4. **Permutation Search**: For the remaining 6 cities, generate all permutations and check:\n   - Flight connectivity between consecutive cities.\n   - The cumulative days calculation ensures the last day is 28.\n   - Tallinn's block includes at least one day between 18 and 20.\n   - Milan's block includes at least one day between 24 and 26.\n\n5. **Output**: Once a valid permutation is found, format the itinerary as a JSON object with day ranges for each city.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    city_days = {\n        'Prague': 5,\n        'Tallinn': 3,\n        'Warsaw': 2,\n        'Porto': 3,\n        'Naples': 5,\n        'Milan': 3,\n        'Lisbon': 5,\n        'Santorini': 5,\n        'Riga': 4,\n        'Stockholm': 2\n    }\n    \n    graph = {\n        'Riga': ['Prague', 'Milan', 'Warsaw', 'Stockholm', 'Tallinn', 'Lisbon'],\n        'Stockholm': ['Milan', 'Lisbon', 'Riga', 'Warsaw', 'Prague', 'Tallinn', 'Santorini'],\n        'Milan': ['Stockholm', 'Riga', 'Naples', 'Porto', 'Prague', 'Lisbon', 'Warsaw', 'Santorini'],\n        'Lisbon': ['Stockholm', 'Warsaw', 'Naples', 'Porto', 'Prague', 'Milan', 'Riga'],\n        'Warsaw': ['Naples', 'Lisbon', 'Stockholm', 'Riga', 'Porto', 'Tallinn', 'Prague', 'Milan'],\n        'Naples': ['Warsaw', 'Milan', 'Lisbon', 'Santorini'],\n        'Porto': ['Lisbon', 'Milan', 'Warsaw'],\n        'Prague': ['Riga', 'Tallinn', 'Stockholm', 'Warsaw', 'Lisbon', 'Milan'],\n        'Tallinn': ['Riga', 'Prague', 'Warsaw', 'Stockholm'],\n        'Santorini': ['Stockholm', 'Milan', 'Naples']\n    }\n    \n    start_sequence = ['Porto', 'Warsaw', 'Stockholm', 'Riga']\n    remaining = ['Prague', 'Tallinn', 'Naples', 'Milan', 'Lisbon', 'Santorini']\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(remaining):\n        full_sequence = start_sequence + list(perm)\n        valid_sequence = True\n        for i in range(len(full_sequence) -

Flight connectivity between consecutive cities.\n   - The cumulative days ensure the itinerary ends on day 28.\n   - Tallinn's stay includes a day between 18 and 20.\n   - Milan's stay includes a day between 24 and 26.\n4. **Output**: The first valid itinerary found is formatted into a JSON object with day ranges for each city and printed. If no valid itinerary is found, an empty itinerary is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible city sequences while adhering to the given constraints, ensuring an optimal and valid itinerary is generated."
