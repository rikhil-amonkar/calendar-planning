        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal 21-day itinerary for visiting 8 European cities while adhering to specific constraints such as required stay durations in each city, fixed events during certain days, and direct flight connections between cities. The solution involves carefully planning the sequence of cities, ensuring that all constraints are met and that travel between cities is only via direct flights.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Constraints and Requirements**: \n   - **Total Days**: The trip spans 21 days.\n   - **City Durations**: Each city has a specific number of days to stay (e.g., Dublin: 5 days, Mykonos: 4 days, etc.).\n   - **Fixed Events**: Certain cities must be visited during specific day ranges (e.g., Dublin from day 11 to 15, Mykonos between day 1 and 4, etc.).\n   - **Flight Connections**: Only direct flights between specified city pairs are allowed.\n\n2. **Sequence Cities Based on Constraints**:\n   - **Mykonos (Days 1-4)**: Must be visited first due to the constraint of being there between days 1-4. Mykonos connects only to Naples.\n   - **Naples (Days 4-7)**: Next city after Mykonos, connected via direct flight. Naples connects to Venice.\n   - **Venice (Days 7-9)**: Next city after Naples, connected via direct flight. Venice connects to Istanbul.\n   - **Istanbul (Days 9-11)**: Next city after Venice, connected via direct flight. Must be visited between days 9-11. Istanbul connects to Dublin.\n   - **Dublin (Days 11-15)**: Next city after Istanbul, connected via direct flight. Must be visited during days 11-15 for an event.\n   - **Frankfurt (Days 15-17)**: Next city after Dublin, connected via direct flight. Must be visited between days 15-17.\n   - **Krakow (Days 17-20)**: Next city after Frankfurt, connected via direct flight.\n   - **Brussels (Days 20-21)**: Final city after Krakow, connected via direct flight.\n\n3. **Validate Flight Connections**:\n   - Ensure each consecutive city in the itinerary has a direct flight connection by checking against the predefined list of flight pairs.\n\n4. **Calculate Day Ranges**:\n   - For each city, compute the start and end days based on its duration. The start day of the next city is the same as the end day of the previous city, accounting for travel days where the traveler is in both cities.\n\n5. **Output the Itinerary**:\n   - Format the itinerary as a JSON object with day ranges and corresponding cities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 21\n    cities_order = [\"Mykonos\", \"Naples\", \"Venice\", \"Istanbul\", \"Dublin\", \"Frankfurt\", \"Krakow\", \"Brussels\"]\n    durations = {\n        \"Mykonos\": 4,\n        \"Naples\": 4,\n        \"Venice\": 3,\n        \"Istanbul\": 3,\n        \"Dublin\": 5,\n        \"Frankfurt\": 3,\n        \"Krakow\": 4,\n        \"Brussels\": 2\n    }\n    \n    flight_pairs = [\n        (\"Dublin\", \"Brussels\"),\n        (\"Mykonos\", \"Naples\"),\n        (\"Venice\", \"Istanbul\"),\n        (\"Frankfurt\", \"Krakow\"),\n        (\"Naples\", \"Dublin\"),\n        (\"Krakow\", \"Brussels\"),\n        (\"Naples\", \"Istanbul\"),\n        (\"Naples\", \"Brussels\"),\n        (\"Istanbul\", \"Frankfurt\"),\n        (\"Brussels\", \"Frankfurt\"),\n        (\"Istanbul\", \"Krakow\"),\n        (\"Istanbul\", \"Brussels\"),\n        (\"Venice\", \"Frankfurt\"),\n        (\"Naples\", \"Frankfurt\"),\n        (\"Dublin\", \"Krakow\"),\n        (\"Venice\", \"Brussels\"),\n        (\"Naples\", \"Venice\"),\n        (\"Istanbul\", \"Dublin\"),\n        (\"Venice\", \"Dublin\"),\n        (\"Dublin\", \"Frankfurt\")\n    ]\n    \n    canonical_flights = set()\n    for a, b in flight_pairs:\n        key = (min(a, b), max(a, b))\n        canonical_flights.add(key)\n    \n    for i in range(len(cities_order) - 1):\n        city1 = cities_order[i]\n        city2 = cities_order[i+1]\n        key = (min(city1, city2), max(city1, city2))\n        if key not in canonical_flights:\n            raise RuntimeError(f\"No direct flight between {city1} and {city2} found.\")\n    \n    start = 1\n    itinerary_list = []\n    for city in cities_order:\n        duration = durations[city]\n        end = start + duration - 1\n        itinerary_list.append({\n            \"day_range\": f\"Day {start}-{end}\",\n            \"place\": city\n        })\n        start = end\n    \n    if end != total_days:\n        raise RuntimeError(f\"Itinerary ends at day {end}, but should end at day {total_days}.\")\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by defining the total trip duration (21 days), the sequence of cities to visit, and the required stay durations for each city.\n2. **Flight Connections**: A list of direct flight pairs is defined, and these pairs are stored in a set for quick lookup.\n3. **Flight Validation**: The code checks if consecutive cities in the itinerary have direct flight connections. If any pair lacks a direct flight, an error is raised.\n4. **Itinerary Calculation**: For each city, the start and end days are calculated based on its duration. The start day of the next city is set to the end day of the current city to account for travel days.\n5. **Output**: The computed itinerary is formatted as a JSON object and printed, listing each city along with its corresponding day range.\n\nThis approach ensures all constraints are met, including fixed events, stay durations, and direct flight connections, resulting in an optimal and valid itinerary."
