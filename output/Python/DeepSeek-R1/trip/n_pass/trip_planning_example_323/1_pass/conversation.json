        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal itinerary for visiting four European cities (London, Split, Oslo, and Porto) over 16 days, adhering to specific constraints and direct flight availability between the cities. The constraints include fixed durations in each city, specific date ranges for certain cities, and ensuring that travel days are accounted for correctly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires planning a 16-day trip to four cities with specific constraints:\n   - Stay in Split for 5 days, specifically from day 7 to day 11.\n   - Stay in London for 7 days, with at least part of the stay between day 1 and day 7.\n   - Stay in Oslo for 2 days.\n   - Stay in Porto for 5 days.\n   - Direct flights are available between London-Oslo, Split-Oslo, Oslo-Porto, and London-Split.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The fixed stay in Split from day 7 to day 11 dictates the schedule around these dates. London must be scheduled before or during the first 7 days to meet its constraint. The remaining cities (Oslo and Porto) must fit into the remaining days after Split, considering travel days where a day spent traveling counts towards both cities.\n\n3. **Itinerary Construction**:\n   - **London (Days 1-7)**: This satisfies the 7-day stay requirement and the constraint of being in London between days 1-7.\n   - **Split (Days 7-11)**: The travel from London to Split occurs on day 7, which counts towards both cities. The stay in Split covers days 7-11.\n   - **Oslo (Days 11-12)**: Travel from Split to Oslo on day 11 counts towards both cities. The stay in Oslo covers days 11-12.\n   - **Porto (Days 12-16)**: Travel from Oslo to Porto on day 12 counts towards both cities. The stay in Porto covers days 12-16.\n\n4. **Validation**: The direct flights between consecutive cities (London\u2192Split, Split\u2192Oslo, Oslo\u2192Porto) are checked to ensure the itinerary is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 16\n    split_days = 5\n    split_fixed_start = 7\n    split_fixed_end = 11\n    london_days = 7\n    london_constraint_start = 1\n    london_constraint_end = 7\n    oslo_days = 2\n    porto_days = 5\n    direct_flights = [('London','Oslo'), ('Split','Oslo'), ('Oslo','Porto'), ('London','Split')]\n\n    london_start = london_constraint_start\n    london_end = london_start + london_days - 1\n    if london_end > london_constraint_end:\n        london_end = london_constraint_end\n\n    split_start = split_fixed_start\n    split_end = split_fixed_end\n\n    oslo_start = split_end\n    oslo_end = oslo_start + oslo_days - 1\n\n    porto_start = oslo_end\n    porto_end = porto_start + porto_days - 1\n\n    cities_order = [\"London\", \"Split\", \"Oslo\", \"Porto\"]\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(cities_order) - 1):\n        a, b = cities_order[i], cities_order[i+1]\n        if (a, b) not in direct_flights and (b, a) not in direct_flights:\n            valid = False\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n        result = {\"itinerary\": []}\n    else:\n        itinerary = [\n            {\"day_range\": f\"Day {london_start}-{london_end}\", \"place\": \"London\"},\n            {\"day_range\": f\"Day {split_start}-{split_end}\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n            {\"day_range\": f\"Day {oslo_start}-{oslo_end}\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n            {\"day_range\": f\"Day {porto_start}-{porto_end}\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n        ]\n        result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary}\n    \n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The constraints and direct flight information are initialized as variables.\n2. **London Schedule**: London is scheduled from day 1 to day 7 to meet the 7-day stay requirement within the specified date range (days 1-7).\n3. **Split Schedule**: Split is scheduled from day 7 to day 11 to cover the mandatory 5-day stay including the annual show.\n4. **Oslo and Porto Schedule**: After Split, Oslo is scheduled for 2 days (days 11-12), followed by Porto for 5 days (days 12-16). This utilizes the remaining days efficiently.\n5. **Flight Validation**: The direct flights between consecutive cities in the itinerary are checked to ensure travel feasibility.\n6. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON object with day ranges for each city and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules the trip by leveraging the given constraints and direct flight information, ensuring all requirements are met while minimizing conflicts. The solution is both optimal and feasible for the given problem constraints."
