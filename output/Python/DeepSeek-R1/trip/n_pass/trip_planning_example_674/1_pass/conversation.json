        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting 6 European cities over 14 days, adhering to specific constraints regarding the duration of stay in each city and fixed events on certain days. The solution involves calculating the sequence of cities and their respective stay durations while ensuring direct flights are available between consecutive cities.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting Helsinki, Warsaw, Reykjavik, Madrid, Split, and Budapest over 14 days. Each city has a fixed duration of stay: Helsinki (2 days), Warsaw (3 days), Reykjavik (2 days), Madrid (4 days), Split (4 days), and Budapest (4 days). Additionally, there are constraints:\n   - Helsinki must include days 1 and 2.\n   - Warsaw must include days 9, 10, and 11.\n   - Reykjavik must include at least one of days 8 or 9 (we use both for simplicity).\n   \n2. **Flight Constraints**: Direct flights are available between specific city pairs. The solution must ensure that consecutive cities in the itinerary have a direct flight connection.\n\n3. **Itinerary Construction**: \n   - Start with Helsinki on days 1-2.\n   - Proceed to Madrid (days 2-5) since there's a direct flight from Helsinki to Madrid.\n   - Move to Budapest (days 5-8) via a direct flight from Madrid.\n   - Travel to Reykjavik (days 8-9) via a direct flight from Budapest.\n   - Fly to Warsaw (days 9-11) via a direct flight from Reykjavik.\n   - End with Split (days 11-14) via a direct flight from Warsaw.\n\n4. **Validation**: The itinerary meets all constraints:\n   - Helsinki covers days 1-2.\n   - Warsaw covers days 9-11.\n   - Reykjavik covers days 8-9.\n   - Total days per city match the requirements.\n   - Direct flights exist between consecutive cities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    segments = []\n    \n    segments.append({\"place\": \"Helsinki\", \"start\": 1, \"end\": 2})\n    \n    next_start = segments[-1][\"end\"]\n    segments.append({\"place\": \"Madrid\", \"start\": next_start, \"end\": next_start + 4 - 1})\n    \n    next_start = segments[-1][\"end\"]\n    segments.append({\"place\": \"Budapest\", \"start\": next_start, \"end\": next_start + 4 - 1})\n    \n    next_start = segments[-1][\"end\"]\n    segments.append({\"place\": \"Reykjavik\", \"start\": next_start, \"end\": next_start + 2 - 1})\n    \n    segments.append({\"place\": \"Warsaw\", \"start\": 9, \"end\": 11})\n    \n    next_start = segments[-1][\"end\"]\n    segments.append({\"place\": \"Split\", \"start\": next_start, \"end\": next_start + 4 - 1})\n    \n    itinerary_list = []\n    for seg in segments:\n        day_range_str = f\"Day {seg['start']}-{seg['end']}\"\n        itinerary_list.append({\n            \"day_range\": day_range_str,\n            \"place\": seg['place']\n        })\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by defining the segments of the itinerary in order, beginning with Helsinki for days 1-2.\n2. **Sequential City Visits**: \n   - After Helsinki, the next city is Madrid (days 2-5), utilizing a direct flight.\n   - From Madrid, the journey proceeds to Budapest (days 5-8) via a direct flight.\n   - Next, Reykjavik is visited (days 8-9) with a direct flight from Budapest.\n   - Warsaw is next (days 9-11), reached via a direct flight from Reykjavik.\n   - The trip concludes in Split (days 11-14) via a direct flight from Warsaw.\n3. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted into a JSON object with day ranges and corresponding cities, printed as the final output.\n\nThis approach efficiently sequences the cities while respecting all constraints and ensuring direct flight availability between consecutive destinations. The solution is optimal and meets all specified requirements."
