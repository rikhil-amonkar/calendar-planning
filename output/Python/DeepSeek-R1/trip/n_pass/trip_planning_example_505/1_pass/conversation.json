        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to generate an optimal 8-day itinerary for visiting five European cities (Prague, Stuttgart, Split, Krakow, and Florence) based on given constraints. The itinerary must account for direct flights between cities, specific stay durations in each city, and event constraints (a wedding in Stuttgart and a meeting in Split).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting five cities in 8 days with specific stay durations (Prague: 4 days, others: 2 days each). Travel between cities must be via direct flights, and certain events must occur within specified days (wedding in Stuttgart between days 2-3, meeting in Split between days 3-4). The solution involves finding a valid sequence of cities connected by direct flights and scheduling stays such that all constraints are met.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent cities and direct flights as an undirected graph where nodes are cities and edges denote direct flights.\n\n3. **Permutation Generation**: Generate all permutations of the cities and check if consecutive cities in each permutation have a direct flight (valid path).\n\n4. **Duration Assignment**: For each valid permutation, assign the required stay durations (Prague: 4 days, others: 2 days).\n\n5. **Travel Day Calculation**: Compute travel days (t1, t2, t3, t4) based on stay durations. These travel days mark transitions between cities.\n\n6. **Event Constraint Checking**: Ensure the stay in Stuttgart includes either day 2 or day 3, and the stay in Split includes either day 3 or day 4.\n\n7. **Itinerary Construction**: For the first valid permutation that meets all constraints, construct the itinerary by mapping day ranges to cities and output it as JSON.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    cities = ['Stuttgart', 'Split', 'Krakow', 'Prague', 'Florence']\n    graph = {\n        'Stuttgart': ['Split', 'Krakow'],\n        'Split': ['Stuttgart', 'Krakow', 'Prague'],\n        'Krakow': ['Stuttgart', 'Split', 'Prague'],\n        'Prague': ['Split', 'Krakow', 'Florence'],\n        'Florence': ['Prague']\n    }\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(cities):\n        valid_path = True\n        for i in range(len(perm) - 1):\n            if perm[i+1] not in graph[perm[i]]:\n                valid_path = False\n                break\n        if not valid_path:\n            continue\n            \n        durations = [4 if city == 'Prague' else 2 for city in perm]\n        \n        t1 = durations[0]\n        t2 = t1 + durations[1] - 1\n        t3 = t2 + durations[2] - 1\n        t4 = t3 + durations[3] - 1\n        d5 = 9 - t4\n        if d5 != durations[4]:\n            continue\n            \n        stuttgart_idx = perm.index('Stuttgart')\n        split_idx = perm.index('Split')\n        \n        if stuttgart_idx == 0:\n            start_st, end_st = 1, t1\n        elif stuttgart_idx == 1:\n            start_st, end_st = t1, t2\n        elif stuttgart_idx == 2:\n            start_st, end_st = t2, t3\n        elif stuttgart_idx == 3:\n            start_st, end_st = t3, t4\n        else:\n            start_st, end_st = t4, 8\n            \n        if not ((start_st <= 2 and end_st >= 2) or (start_st <= 3 and end_st >= 3)):\n            continue\n            \n        if split_idx == 0:\n            start_sp, end_sp = 1, t1\n        elif split_idx == 1:\n            start_sp, end_sp = t1, t2\n        elif split_idx == 2:\n            start_sp, end_sp = t2, t3\n        elif split_idx == 3:\n            start_sp, end_sp = t3, t4\n        else:\n            start_sp, end_sp = t4, 8\n            \n        if not ((start_sp <= 3 and end_sp >= 3) or (start_sp <= 4 and end_sp >= 4)):\n            continue\n            \n        itinerary = [\n            {\"day_range\": f\"Day 1-{t1}\", \"place\": perm[0]},\n            {\"day_range\": f\"Day {t1}-{t2}\", \"place\": perm[1]},\n            {\"day_range\": f\"Day {t2}-{t3}\", \"place\": perm[2]},\n            {\"day_range\": f\"Day {t3}-{t4}\", \"place\": perm[3]},\n            {\"day_range\": f\"Day {t4}-8\", \"place\": perm[4]}\n        ]\n        \n        print(json.dumps({\"itinerary\": itinerary}))\n        return\n    \n    print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No valid itinerary found\"}))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Representation**: The cities and direct flights are represented as an undirected graph using a dictionary.\n2. **Permutation Check**: All permutations of the cities are generated. Each permutation is checked to ensure consecutive cities have a direct flight (valid path).\n3. **Duration Assignment**: For each valid permutation, durations are assigned (4 days for Prague, 2 days for others).\n4. **Travel Day Calculation**: Travel days (t1, t2, t3, t4) are computed based on stay durations. These mark the days of transition between cities.\n5. **Event Constraints**: The solution checks if the stay in Stuttgart includes day 2 or 3 and the stay in Split includes day 3 or 4.\n6. **Itinerary Construction**: The first valid permutation meeting all constraints is used to build the itinerary. Day ranges for each city are formatted, and the itinerary is printed as JSON.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible city sequences, checks constraints, and constructs a valid itinerary that meets all given requirements."
