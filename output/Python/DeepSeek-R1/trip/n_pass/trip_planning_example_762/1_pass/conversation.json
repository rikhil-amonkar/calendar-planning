You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 3 days in Dublin. You would like to meet your friends at Dublin between day 7 and day 9 to tour together.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to generate an optimal itinerary for visiting six European cities over 13 days, adhering to specific constraints regarding the duration of stay in each city and direct flight connections between them. The solution involves leveraging permutations to explore all possible city sequences, ensuring each sequence meets the given constraints and flight connectivity requirements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting six cities (Dublin, Madrid, Oslo, Vilnius, London, Berlin) over 13 days with specific stay durations (3, 2, 3, 3, 2, and 5 days respectively). Direct flights between certain cities must be used for transitions. Key constraints include:\n   - Spending 3 days in Dublin, with at least one day between days 7-9.\n   - Spending 2 days in Madrid, with at least one day between days 2-3.\n   - Spending 5 days in Berlin, with at least one day between days 3-7.\n   - Each flight day counts as a day in both the departure and arrival cities.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and direct flights as an adjacency list to validate flight connections between consecutive cities in any permutation.\n\n3. **Permutation Generation**: Generate all permutations of the six cities to explore every possible sequence. For each permutation:\n   - **Flight Validation**: Check if consecutive cities in the permutation have a direct flight.\n   - **Day Calculation**: Compute start and end days for each city in the sequence. The start day of each city is the end day of the previous city (since flight days overlap).\n   - **Constraint Validation**: Ensure the start days for Madrid, Dublin, and Berlin meet their respective constraints (Madrid \u2264 day 3, Dublin between days 5-9, Berlin \u2264 day 7).\n\n4. **Output**: The first valid permutation that satisfies all constraints is formatted into a JSON object listing each city's day range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    cities = ['Dublin', 'Madrid', 'Oslo', 'Vilnius', 'London', 'Berlin']\n    durations = {\n        'Dublin': 3,\n        'Madrid': 2,\n        'Oslo': 3,\n        'Vilnius': 3,\n        'London': 2,\n        'Berlin': 5\n    }\n    \n    graph = {\n        'London': ['Madrid', 'Oslo', 'Dublin', 'Berlin'],\n        'Madrid': ['London', 'Oslo', 'Dublin', 'Berlin'],\n        'Oslo': ['Vilnius', 'Madrid', 'London', 'Berlin', 'Dublin'],\n        'Vilnius': ['Oslo', 'Berlin'],\n        'Berlin': ['Vilnius', 'Oslo', 'Madrid', 'London', 'Dublin'],\n        'Dublin': ['Madrid', 'Oslo', 'London', 'Berlin']\n    }\n    \n    found = False\n    result_itinerary = None\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(cities):\n        valid_flight = True\n        for i in range(len(perm)-1):\n            if perm[i+1] not in graph[perm[i]]:\n                valid_flight = False\n                break\n        if not valid_flight:\n            continue\n        \n        starts = []\n        ends = []\n        current_start = 1\n        for city in perm:\n            dur = durations[city]\n            end_day = current_start + dur - 1\n            starts.append(current_start)\n            ends.append(end_day)\n            current_start = end_day\n        \n        if ends[-1] != 13:\n            continue\n        \n        idx_madrid = perm.index('Madrid')\n        if starts[idx_madrid] > 3:\n            continue\n        \n        idx_dublin = perm.index('Dublin')\n        if starts[idx_dublin] < 5 or starts[idx_dublin] > 9:\n            continue\n        \n        idx_berlin = perm.index('Berlin')\n        if starts[idx_berlin] > 7:\n            continue\n        \n        itinerary_list = []\n        for i in range(len(perm)):\n            day_range_str = f\"Day {starts[i]}-{ends[i]}\"\n            itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": perm[i]})\n        \n        result_itinerary = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n        found = True\n        break\n    \n    if found:\n        print(json.dumps(result_itinerary))\n    else:\n        print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No valid itinerary found.\"}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The cities and their respective stay durations are defined. The direct flight connections are represented as an adjacency list.\n2. **Permutation Check**: For each permutation of cities:\n   - **Flight Validity**: Ensures consecutive cities in the permutation have a direct flight.\n   - **Day Calculation**: Computes start and end days for each city. The start day of a city is the end day of the previous city, accounting for overlapping flight days.\n   - **Constraint Check**: Validates if the start days for Madrid, Dublin, and Berlin meet their specific constraints.\n3. **Output**: The first valid permutation is formatted into a JSON object, listing each city's day range. If no valid permutation is found, an error message is returned.\n4. **Execution**: The script runs independently, outputting the itinerary as a JSON string when executed.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible city sequences, ensuring the solution adheres to all given constraints and flight connectivity requirements."
