        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal itinerary for visiting four European cities over 13 days, adhering to specific constraints regarding the duration of stay in each city, direct flight connections, and particular days where certain cities must be visited. The solution involves constructing a sequence of city visits that satisfies all given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves planning a trip across four cities (Seville, Stuttgart, Porto, Madrid) over 13 days. Each city has a specified number of days to be spent there, with additional constraints:\n   - Stay in Seville for 2 days.\n   - Stay in Stuttgart for 7 days, including days 7 and 13 for a conference.\n   - Stay in Porto for 3 days.\n   - Stay in Madrid for 4 days, with the visit occurring between days 1 and 4 (inclusive).\n   - Direct flights are available only between specific city pairs: Porto-Stuttgart, Seville-Porto, Madrid-Porto, and Madrid-Seville.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The constraints suggest a fixed order of visits:\n   - Madrid must be visited first (days 1-4) to meet the relative visit constraint.\n   - From Madrid, the next city must be directly connected (either Seville or Porto). We choose Seville next (days 4-5) to ensure the subsequent connection to Porto is feasible.\n   - After Seville, proceed to Porto (days 5-7), leveraging the direct flight connection.\n   - Finally, travel from Porto to Stuttgart (days 7-13), which has a direct flight and accommodates the conference days.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution uses a greedy approach to sequentially assign city stays based on direct flight connections and duration constraints. The itinerary is built step-by-step, ensuring each segment adheres to the flight connections and duration requirements.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves a fixed number of steps (four cities), making the time complexity O(1). The space complexity is also O(1) as the storage requirements are minimal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 13\n    stays = {\n        \"Seville\": 2,\n        \"Stuttgart\": 7,\n        \"Porto\": 3,\n        \"Madrid\": 4\n    }\n    stuttgart_conference_days = [7, 13]\n    madrid_min_day = 1\n    madrid_max_day = 4\n    graph = {\n        \"Porto\": [\"Stuttgart\", \"Seville\", \"Madrid\"],\n        \"Seville\": [\"Porto\", \"Madrid\"],\n        \"Madrid\": [\"Porto\", \"Seville\"],\n        \"Stuttgart\": [\"Porto\"]\n    }\n    \n    segments = []\n    \n    start_madrid = 1\n    end_madrid = start_madrid + stays[\"Madrid\"] - 1\n    segments.append((start_madrid, end_madrid, \"Madrid\"))\n    \n    current_city = \"Madrid\"\n    current_end = end_madrid\n    next_city = \"Seville\"\n    if next_city in graph[current_city]:\n        start_next = current_end\n        end_next = start_next + stays[next_city] - 1\n        segments.append((start_next, end_next, next_city))\n        current_city = next_city\n        current_end = end_next\n    else:\n        next_city = \"Porto\"\n        if next_city in graph[current_city]:\n            start_next = current_end\n            end_next = start_next + stays[next_city] - 1\n            segments.append((start_next, end_next, next_city))\n            current_city = next_city\n            current_end = end_next\n    \n    if current_city == \"Seville\":\n        next_city = \"Porto\"\n        if next_city in graph[current_city]:\n            start_next = current_end\n            end_next = start_next + stays[next_city] - 1\n            segments.append((start_next, end_next, next_city))\n            current_city = next_city\n            current_end = end_next\n    elif current_city == \"Porto\":\n        next_city = \"Seville\"\n        if next_city in graph[current_city]:\n            start_next = current_end\n            end_next = start_next + stays[next_city] - 1\n            segments.append((start_next, end_next, next_city))\n            current_city = next_city\n            current_end = end_next\n    \n    if current_city in graph:\n        next_city = \"Stuttgart\"\n        if next_city in graph[current_city]:\n            start_next = current_end\n            end_next = start_next + stays[next_city] - 1\n            if end_next <= total_days:\n                segments.append((start_next, end_next, next_city))\n    \n    itinerary_list = []\n    for seg in segments:\n        start, end, city = seg\n        if start == end:\n            day_range_str = f\"Day {start}\"\n        else:\n            day_range_str = f\"Day {start}-{end}\"\n        itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": city})\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by defining the total days, stay durations for each city, conference days in Stuttgart, and the direct flight connections.\n2. **Madrid Segment**: The itinerary begins with Madrid from day 1 to day 4 to meet the relative visit constraint.\n3. **Seville Segment**: From Madrid, the next city is Seville (days 4-5), utilizing the direct flight connection.\n4. **Porto Segment**: After Seville, the trip proceeds to Porto (days 5-7), again using a direct flight.\n5. **Stuttgart Segment**: The final segment is Stuttgart (days 7-13), ensuring the conference days (7 and 13) are covered.\n6. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted into a JSON object with day ranges and corresponding cities, printed as the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs the itinerary by leveraging direct flight connections and adhering to all specified constraints, ensuring an optimal and feasible trip plan."
