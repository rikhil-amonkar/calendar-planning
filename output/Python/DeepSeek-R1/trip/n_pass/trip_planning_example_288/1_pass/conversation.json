        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal itinerary for visiting four European cities over 15 days, adhering to specific constraints on the duration of stay in each city and the availability of direct flights between them. The constraints include fixed periods for attending events in Manchester and Stuttgart, and the requirement that travel days count towards stays in both departure and arrival cities.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The trip involves visiting Manchester, Stuttgart, Madrid, and Vienna over 15 days. Manchester must be visited for 7 days within days 1-7 (due to a wedding), and Stuttgart for 5 days within days 11-15 (due to a workshop). Madrid requires 4 days, and Vienna 2 days. Direct flights exist between specific city pairs, which dictates the feasible travel routes.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The itinerary must start in Manchester (days 1-7) and end in Stuttgart (days 11-15). The remaining days (7-11) must accommodate Madrid (4 days) and Vienna (2 days). The challenge is to sequence Madrid and Vienna such that direct flights connect Manchester to the first middle city, the first to the second middle city, and the second to Stuttgart.\n\n3. **Flight Graph**: Construct an undirected graph of direct flight connections. Check possible sequences of the middle cities (Madrid then Vienna or Vienna then Madrid) to ensure valid flight paths.\n\n4. **Itinerary Construction**: \n   - Manchester: Days 1-7.\n   - First middle city: Starts on day 7 (transition day from Manchester) and lasts for its required days.\n   - Second middle city: Starts on the last day of the first middle city and lasts for its required days, ending on day 11.\n   - Stuttgart: Days 11-15.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 15\n    cities = {\n        'Manchester': {'days': 7, 'event': (1, 7)},\n        'Stuttgart': {'days': 5, 'event': (11, 15)},\n        'Madrid': {'days': 4},\n        'Vienna': {'days': 2}\n    }\n    \n    direct_flights = [\n        ('Vienna', 'Stuttgart'),\n        ('Manchester', 'Vienna'),\n        ('Madrid', 'Vienna'),\n        ('Manchester', 'Stuttgart'),\n        ('Manchester', 'Madrid')\n    ]\n    \n    graph = {}\n    for a, b in direct_flights:\n        if a not in graph:\n            graph[a] = set()\n        if b not in graph:\n            graph[b] = set()\n        graph[a].add(b)\n        graph[b].add(a)\n    \n    orders = [\n        ['Madrid', 'Vienna'],\n        ['Vienna', 'Madrid']\n    ]\n    \n    valid_order = None\n    for order in orders:\n        city1, city2 = order\n        if 'Manchester' in graph and city1 in graph['Manchester']:\n            if city1 in graph and city2 in graph[city1]:\n                if city2 in graph and 'Stuttgart' in graph[city2]:\n                    valid_order = order\n                    break\n    \n    itinerary_segments = []\n    itinerary_segments.append({'day_range': f\"Day 1-7\", 'place': 'Manchester'})\n    \n    if valid_order:\n        city1, city2 = valid_order\n        days_city1 = cities[city1]['days']\n        start_city1 = 7\n        end_city1 = start_city1 + days_city1 - 1\n        itinerary_segments.append({'day_range': f\"Day {start_city1}-{end_city1}\", 'place': city1})\n        \n        days_city2 = cities[city2]['days']\n        start_city2 = end_city1\n        end_city2 = start_city2 + days_city2 - 1\n        itinerary_segments.append({'day_range': f\"Day {start_city2}-{end_city2}\", 'place': city2})\n        \n        itinerary_segments.append({'day_range': \"Day 11-15\", 'place': 'Stuttgart'})\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"No valid itinerary found\")\n    \n    result = {'itinerary': itinerary_segments}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code initializes the total trip duration (15 days) and the constraints for each city, including required stay durations and event periods.\n2. **Flight Graph Construction**: An undirected graph is built to represent direct flight connections between cities.\n3. **Order Validation**: The code checks possible sequences of the middle cities (Madrid and Vienna) to ensure valid flight paths from Manchester, between the middle cities, and to Stuttgart.\n4. **Itinerary Construction**: The itinerary is constructed starting with Manchester (days 1-7), followed by the validated sequence of middle cities, and ending with Stuttgart (days 11-15). Each segment's day range is formatted as \"Day X-Y\".\n5. **Output**: The resulting itinerary is printed as a JSON object with the 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\n\nThis approach efficiently sequences the cities based on given constraints and direct flight availability, ensuring the itinerary meets all requirements."
