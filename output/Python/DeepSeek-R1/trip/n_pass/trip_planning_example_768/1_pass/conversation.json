        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting six European cities over 16 days, adhering to specific constraints regarding the duration of stay in each city and direct flight connections between them. The solution involves generating permutations of the cities, validating flight connections, and ensuring all constraints are met, such as the conference in Nice on days 14-16 and meeting a friend in Oslo between days 10 and 14.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to plan a 16-day trip to six cities (Mykonos, Nice, London, Copenhagen, Oslo, Tallinn) with specific stay durations (4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 4 days respectively). The itinerary must include direct flights between consecutive cities, and Nice must be visited on days 14-16 for a conference. Additionally, Oslo must be visited between days 10 and 14 to meet a friend.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and direct flights as an undirected graph using an adjacency list. This helps in validating flight connections between consecutive cities in any permutation.\n\n3. **Permutations Generation**: Generate all permutations of the five cities (excluding Nice, which is fixed at the end). For each permutation, check:\n   - **Flight Connections**: Ensure consecutive cities in the permutation have direct flights.\n   - **Connection to Nice**: The last city in the permutation must have a direct flight to Nice.\n   - **Oslo Constraint**: Calculate the start day of Oslo in the permutation and ensure it falls between days 6 and 14 inclusive.\n\n4. **Day Calculation**: For valid permutations, compute the start and end days for each city. The start day of each subsequent city is the end day of the previous city (since travel days are shared). The end day for each city is calculated based on its duration.\n\n5. **Output**: Construct the itinerary as a list of dictionaries with day ranges and corresponding cities, then output it in JSON format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    graph = {\n        'London': ['Copenhagen', 'Mykonos', 'Nice', 'Oslo'],\n        'Copenhagen': ['London', 'Tallinn', 'Nice', 'Oslo'],\n        'Tallinn': ['Copenhagen', 'Oslo'],\n        'Mykonos': ['London', 'Nice'],\n        'Oslo': ['Tallinn', 'Nice', 'London', 'Copenhagen'],\n        'Nice': ['Oslo', 'London', 'Mykonos', 'Copenhagen']\n    }\n    \n    durations = {\n        'Mykonos': 4,\n        'London': 2,\n        'Copenhagen': 3,\n        'Tallinn': 4,\n        'Oslo': 5\n    }\n    \n    cities = ['Mykonos', 'London', 'Copenhagen', 'Tallinn', 'Oslo']\n    found = False\n    valid_perm = None\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(cities):\n        valid_flight = True\n        for i in range(len(perm)-1):\n            if perm[i+1] not in graph[perm[i]]:\n                valid_flight = False\n                break\n        if not valid_flight:\n            continue\n            \n        if 'Nice' not in graph[perm[4]]:\n            continue\n            \n        try:\n            k = perm.index('Oslo')\n        except ValueError:\n            continue\n            \n        if k == 0:\n            start_oslo = 1\n        elif k == 1:\n            start_oslo = durations[perm[0]]\n        elif k == 2:\n            start_oslo = durations[perm[0]] + durations[perm[1]] - 1\n        elif k == 3:\n            start_oslo = durations[perm[0]] + durations[perm[1]] + durations[perm[2]] - 2\n        elif k == 4:\n            start_oslo = durations[perm[0]] + durations[perm[1]] + durations[perm[2]] + durations[perm[3]] - 3\n            \n        if start_oslo < 6 or start_oslo > 14:\n            continue\n            \n        found = True\n        valid_perm = perm\n        break\n        \n    if not found:\n        print(json.dumps({\"itinerary\": []}))\n        return\n        \n    starts = [0] * 5\n    ends = [0] * 5\n    starts[0] = 1\n    ends[0] = starts[0] + durations[valid_perm[0]] - 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, 5):\n        starts[i] = ends[i-1]\n        ends[i] = starts[i] + durations[valid_perm[i]] - 1\n        \n    itinerary_list = []\n    for i in range(5):\n        s = starts[i]\n        e = ends[i]\n        if s == e:\n            day_range_str = f\"Day {s}\"\n        else:\n            day_range_str = f\"Day {s}-{e}\"\n        itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": valid_perm[i]})\n        \n    itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 14-16\", \"place\": \"Nice\"})\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is built using an adjacency list where each city points to cities it has direct flights to.\n2. **Permutations Check**: All permutations of the five cities (excluding Nice) are generated. For each permutation:\n   - **Flight Validity**: Checks if consecutive cities in the permutation have direct flights.\n   - **Nice Connection**: Ensures the last city connects to Nice.\n   - **Oslo Constraint**: Calculates Oslo's start day in the itinerary and checks if it lies between days 6 and 14.\n3. **Day Calculation**: For valid permutations, computes start and end days for each city. The start day of each city is the end day of the previous city (shared travel day). The end day is derived from the city's duration.\n4. **Output**: Constructs the itinerary as a list of dictionaries with day ranges and cities, then outputs it in JSON format. The last three days (14-16) are fixed for Nice."
