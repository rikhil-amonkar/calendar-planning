        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal itinerary for visiting three European cities (Mykonos, Vienna, and Venice) over 10 days, adhering to specific constraints regarding the duration of stay in each city and flight connections. The solution involves determining the sequence of cities that satisfies all given constraints, including direct flight availability and workshop attendance requirements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The trip must span exactly 10 days with specific durations in each city: 6 days in Venice (including a workshop between days 5 and 10), 2 days in Mykonos, and 4 days in Vienna. Direct flights are only available between Mykonos and Vienna, and between Vienna and Venice. The key insight is that travel days count towards the stay in both the departing and arriving cities.\n2. **Order Determination**: Given the flight constraints, the feasible city sequences are:\n   - Mykonos \u2192 Vienna \u2192 Venice\n   - Venice \u2192 Vienna \u2192 Mykonos\n   The first sequence is chosen because it ensures Venice covers days 5 to 10, meeting the workshop requirement.\n3. **Duration Calculation**: \n   - Mykonos: Days 1 to 2 (2 days)\n   - Vienna: Days 2 to 5 (4 days, including travel days)\n   - Venice: Days 5 to 10 (6 days, covering the workshop period)\n4. **Output Format**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON object with day ranges and corresponding cities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 10\n    venice_days = 6\n    workshop_start = 5\n    workshop_end = 10\n    mykonos_days = 2\n    vienna_days = 4\n\n    segments = []\n    current_start = 1\n\n    end_mykonos = current_start + mykonos_days - 1\n    segments.append((\"Mykonos\", current_start, end_mykonos))\n    current_start = end_mykonos\n\n    end_vienna = current_start + vienna_days - 1\n    segments.append((\"Vienna\", current_start, end_vienna))\n    current_start = end_vienna\n\n    end_venice = current_start + venice_days - 1\n    segments.append((\"Venice\", current_start, end_venice))\n\n    itinerary_list = []\n    for city, start, end in segments:\n        day_range_str = f\"Day {start}-{end}\"\n        itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": city})\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by defining the constraints: total days (10), days in each city (Venice: 6, Mykonos: 2, Vienna: 4), and the workshop period (days 5 to 10).\n2. **Segment Calculation**: \n   - **Mykonos Segment**: Starts on day 1 and lasts 2 days, ending on day 2.\n   - **Vienna Segment**: Starts on day 2 (the travel day from Mykonos) and lasts 4 days, ending on day 5.\n   - **Venice Segment**: Starts on day 5 (the travel day from Vienna) and lasts 6 days, ending on day 10.\n3. **JSON Output**: The itinerary is constructed as a list of dictionaries, each specifying the day range and city. The result is printed as a JSON object with the key \"itinerary\".\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the itinerary by leveraging the given constraints and direct flight connections, ensuring all requirements are met, including the workshop attendance in Venice during the specified period."
