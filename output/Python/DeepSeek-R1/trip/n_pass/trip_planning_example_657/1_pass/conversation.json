You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 4 days in Frankfurt. From day 13 to day 16, there is a annual show you want to attend in Frankfurt. You want to spend 4 days in Manchester. You would like to visit Valencia for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Naples. You plan to stay in Oslo for 3 days. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 2 days.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting 6 European cities over 16 days, adhering to specific constraints regarding the duration of stay in each city and direct flight availability between cities. The itinerary must account for fixed events, such as a show in Frankfurt from days 13 to 16 and a wedding in Vilnius between days 12 and 13.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves scheduling visits to 6 cities (Frankfurt, Manchester, Valencia, Naples, Oslo, Vilnius) over 16 days, ensuring each city is visited for a specified number of days. The constraints include:\n   - Fixed stay in Frankfurt from days 13 to 16 (4 days).\n   - Vilnius must be visited for 2 days, with one of these days being either day 12 or 13 due to a wedding.\n   - Direct flights between specific city pairs must be used for transitions.\n   \n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Frankfurt Allocation**: The last 4 days (13-16) are reserved for Frankfurt.\n   - **Vilnius Allocation**: To meet the wedding constraint, Vilnius must include day 12. The optimal solution places Vilnius as the last city before Frankfurt, covering days 12 and 13 (with day 13 as a travel day to Frankfurt).\n   - **Flight Constraints**: The itinerary must use only direct flights between consecutive cities. The valid flight paths are derived from the given connections.\n   - **Block Scheduling**: Each city (except Vilnius) is allocated a consecutive block of days. Vilnius is scheduled for days 12 and 13, with day 13 shared with Frankfurt.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Order of Cities**: The cities are ordered based on direct flight availability and duration constraints: Valencia \u2192 Naples \u2192 Manchester \u2192 Oslo \u2192 Vilnius \u2192 Frankfurt.\n   - **Day Calculation**: \n     - For non-last cities in the sequence, the stay duration is exactly the required days.\n     - For Vilnius (the last city before Frankfurt), the stay includes an extra day (day 13) for travel to Frankfurt, making its total 2 days.\n   - **Itinerary Construction**: The itinerary is built by sequentially assigning day ranges to each city, ensuring overlaps on travel days where necessary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    itinerary_list = []\n    start = 1\n    cities = [(\"Valencia\", 4), (\"Naples\", 4), (\"Manchester\", 4), (\"Oslo\", 3), (\"Vilnius\", 1)]\n    \n    for i in range(4):\n        city, block = cities[i]\n        end = start + block - 1\n        itinerary_list.append({\n            \"day_range\": f\"Day {start}-{end}\",\n            \"place\": city\n        })\n        start = end\n    \n    city, block = cities[4]\n    end = start + block\n    itinerary_list.append({\n        \"day_range\": f\"Day {start}-{end}\",\n        \"place\": city\n    })\n    start_frank = end\n    end_frank = start_frank + 3\n    itinerary_list.append({\n        \"day_range\": f\"Day {start_frank}-{end_frank}\",\n        \"place\": \"Frankfurt\"\n    })\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The itinerary starts on day 1. The cities are ordered based on direct flight paths and duration constraints.\n2. **Non-Last Cities Processing**: For each city (except Vilnius), the stay duration is calculated as consecutive days. The end day is `start + block - 1`, where `block` is the required stay duration. The next city starts on the same end day (travel day).\n3. **Vilnius Processing**: Vilnius is scheduled from day 12 to 13. The end day is `start + block` (without subtracting 1) to include the travel day to Frankfurt (day 13).\n4. **Frankfurt Allocation**: Frankfurt is scheduled from day 13 to 16, covering the fixed show duration.\n5. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON object with day ranges and corresponding cities, printed as the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules the cities while respecting all constraints, leveraging direct flights and ensuring optimal use of the 16 days. The solution is both systematic and adaptable to similar trip planning problems."
