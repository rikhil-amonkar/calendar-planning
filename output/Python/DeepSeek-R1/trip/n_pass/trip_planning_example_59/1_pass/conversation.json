You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Lyon for 7 days. You want to spend 7 days in Bucharest. You are going to attend a wedding in Bucharest between day 1 and day 7.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal itinerary for visiting three European cities (Bucharest, Lyon, and Porto) over 16 days, adhering to specific constraints. The constraints include staying in each city for a predetermined number of days, ensuring direct flights between consecutive cities, and attending a wedding in Bucharest between days 1 and 7.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves planning a trip itinerary that visits three cities (Bucharest, Lyon, and Porto) over 16 days. The constraints are:\n   - Stay in Bucharest for 7 days, including the wedding between days 1 and 7.\n   - Stay in Lyon for 7 days.\n   - Stay in Porto for 4 days.\n   - Direct flights exist only between Bucharest-Lyon and Lyon-Porto.\n   - Travel days count as being in both the departure and arrival cities on the same day.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The wedding in Bucharest must occur within the first 7 days, so Bucharest must be the starting city. The only feasible route due to direct flight constraints is Bucharest \u2192 Lyon \u2192 Porto.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Graph Construction**: Represent cities and direct flights as an undirected graph.\n   - **Path Finding**: Use a depth-first search (DFS) to find a path starting from Bucharest that visits all cities exactly once.\n   - **Day Assignment**: Assign days sequentially, where each city's stay ends on the day of departure to the next city. The next city's stay starts on the same day.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The graph has three nodes and two edges. The DFS explores up to two possible paths (though only one is feasible), making the complexity O(1) for this fixed input size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 16\n    city_durations = {\n        'Bucharest': 7,\n        'Lyon': 7,\n        'Porto': 4\n    }\n    direct_flights = [('Bucharest', 'Lyon'), ('Lyon', 'Porto')]\n    wedding_city = 'Bucharest'\n    \n    graph = {}\n    for a, b in direct_flights:\n        graph.setdefault(a, []).append(b)\n        graph.setdefault(b, []).append(a)\n    \n    total_cities = len(city_durations)\n    stack = [[wedding_city]]\n    path = None\n    while stack:\n        current_path = stack.pop()\n        if len(current_path) == total_cities:\n            path = current_path\n            break\n        last = current_path[-1]\n        if last in graph:\n            for neighbor in graph[last]:\n                if neighbor not in current_path:\n                    new_path = current_path + [neighbor]\n                    stack.append(new_path)\n    \n    if path is None:\n        result = {\"itinerary\": []}\n        print(json.dumps(result))\n        return\n    \n    current_day = 1\n    itinerary_list = []\n    for city in path:\n        dur = city_durations[city]\n        end_day = current_day + dur - 1\n        itinerary_list.append({\n            \"day_range\": f\"Day {current_day}-{end_day}\",\n            \"place\": city\n        })\n        current_day = end_day\n    \n    if end_day > total_days:\n        result = {\"itinerary\": []}\n    else:\n        result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    \n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Construction**: The direct flights between cities are represented as an undirected graph where each node is a city, and edges represent direct flights.\n2. **Path Finding**: Using DFS, the algorithm searches for a path starting from Bucharest that visits all three cities exactly once. The feasible path found is Bucharest \u2192 Lyon \u2192 Porto.\n3. **Day Assignment**: \n   - **Bucharest**: Days 1 to 7 (7 days).\n   - **Lyon**: Days 7 to 13 (7 days, with day 7 shared with Bucharest).\n   - **Porto**: Days 13 to 16 (4 days, with day 13 shared with Lyon).\n4. **Output**: The itinerary is printed as a JSON object with day ranges and corresponding cities, ensuring all constraints are met within the 16-day limit. The travel days (day 7 and 13) are counted in both the departing and arriving cities."
