You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Berlin for 3 days. During day 1 and day 3, you have to attend a conference in Berlin. You plan to stay in Nice for 5 days. You would like to visit Athens for 5 days. You would like to visit Stockholm for 5 days. You want to spend 2 days in Barcelona. You have to attend a workshop in Barcelona between day 3 and day 4. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 4 days. You want to spend 2 days in Lyon. You are going to attend a wedding in Lyon between day 4 and day 5.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLyon and Nice, Stockholm and Athens, Nice and Athens, Berlin and Athens, Berlin and Nice, Berlin and Barcelona, Berlin and Vilnius, Barcelona and Nice, Athens and Vilnius, Berlin and Stockholm, Nice and Stockholm, Barcelona and Athens, Barcelona and Stockholm, Barcelona and Lyon.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
