You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 3 days in Frankfurt. You want to spend 4 days in Naples. You would like to visit Helsinki for 4 days. From day 2 to day 5, there is a annual show you want to attend in Helsinki. You want to spend 3 days in Lyon. You want to spend 2 days in Prague. You have to attend a workshop in Prague between day 1 and day 2.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPrague and Lyon, Prague and Frankfurt, Frankfurt and Lyon, Helsinki and Naples, Helsinki and Frankfurt, Naples and Frankfurt, Prague and Helsinki.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting 5 European cities over 12 days, considering specific constraints on the duration of stay in each city and direct flight connections between them. The solution involves calculating a sequence of city visits that respects all constraints and ensures travel between cities is only via available direct flights.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting five cities (Prague, Helsinki, Naples, Frankfurt, Lyon) over 12 days with specific stay durations (2, 4, 4, 3, and 3 days respectively). Key constraints include:\n   - Must attend a workshop in Prague on days 1 and 2.\n   - Must attend an annual show in Helsinki from days 2 to 5.\n   - Direct flights between cities are predefined.\n   - Travel days count towards stays in both the departing and arriving cities.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The constraints fix the start days for Prague (day 1) and Helsinki (day 2). The remaining cities must follow in an order that respects direct flight connections and stay durations. The optimal sequence derived is Prague \u2192 Helsinki \u2192 Naples \u2192 Frankfurt \u2192 Lyon.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - **Initialize City Durations**: Define the number of days to spend in each city.\n   - **Flight Graph**: Represent direct flights as an adjacency list to validate connections between consecutive cities in the itinerary.\n   - **Itinerary Calculation**: Start with Prague on day 1. For each subsequent city, the start day is the end day of the previous city (since travel days overlap). Calculate the end day as `start_day + duration - 1`.\n   - **Validation**: Ensure each consecutive city pair has a direct flight and the total days do not exceed 12.\n\n4. **Output**: Generate a JSON-formatted itinerary listing each city's stay duration in day ranges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 12\n    cities_order = ['Prague', 'Helsinki', 'Naples', 'Frankfurt', 'Lyon']\n    durations = {\n        'Prague': 2,\n        'Helsinki': 4,\n        'Naples': 4,\n        'Frankfurt': 3,\n        'Lyon': 3\n    }\n    \n    graph = {\n        'Prague': ['Lyon', 'Frankfurt', 'Helsinki'],\n        'Lyon': ['Prague', 'Frankfurt'],\n        'Frankfurt': ['Prague', 'Lyon', 'Helsinki', 'Naples'],\n        'Helsinki': ['Prague', 'Frankfurt', 'Naples'],\n        'Naples': ['Helsinki', 'Frankfurt']\n    }\n    \n    for i in range(len(cities_order) - 1):\n        current_city = cities_order[i]\n        next_city = cities_order[i + 1]\n        if next_city not in graph[current_city]:\n            raise ValueError(f\"No direct flight from {current_city} to {next_city}\")\n    \n    current_start = 1\n    itinerary_list = []\n    for city in cities_order:\n        dur = durations[city]\n        current_end = current_start + dur - 1\n        if current_end > total_days:\n            raise ValueError(\"Total days exceeded\")\n        itinerary_list.append({\n            \"day_range\": f\"Day {current_start}-{current_end}\",\n            \"place\": city\n        })\n        current_start = current_end\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The cities and their respective stay durations are defined. The flight connections are represented as a graph using an adjacency list.\n2. **Flight Validation**: The code checks if consecutive cities in the itinerary (`cities_order`) have a direct flight connection. If not, it raises an error.\n3. **Itinerary Calculation**: Starting from day 1, the code calculates the end day for each city by adding its duration minus one. The start day for the next city is set to the end day of the previous city, accounting for travel days overlapping.\n4. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a list of dictionaries, each specifying the day range and city. The result is printed as a JSON object.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes a valid itinerary that meets all constraints by leveraging predefined city sequences and validating flight connections, ensuring optimal use of the 12-day trip."
