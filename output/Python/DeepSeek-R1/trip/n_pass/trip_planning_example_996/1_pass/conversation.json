You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 5 days in Valencia. You would like to visit Riga for 5 days. You want to spend 3 days in Prague. You plan to visit relatives in Prague between day 7 and day 9. You want to spend 3 days in Mykonos. You are going to attend a wedding in Mykonos between day 1 and day 3. You want to spend 5 days in Zurich. You would like to visit Bucharest for 5 days. You plan to stay in Nice for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMykonos and Nice, Mykonos and Zurich, Prague and Bucharest, Valencia and Bucharest, Zurich and Prague, Riga and Nice, Zurich and Riga, Zurich and Bucharest, Zurich and Valencia, Bucharest and Riga, Prague and Riga, Prague and Valencia, Zurich and Nice.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 22 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting 7 European cities over 22 days, considering specific constraints on the duration of stay in each city and fixed events in certain cities. The solution involves arranging the cities in a sequence that respects direct flight connections and ensures all constraints are met.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves planning a trip itinerary where:\n   - Each city has a specified duration of stay.\n   - Fixed events in Mykonos (days 1-3) and Prague (days 7-9) must be adhered to.\n   - Travel between cities must use direct flights only.\n   - The total trip duration is 22 days, with travel days counted in both the departure and arrival cities.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The fixed events in Mykonos and Prague dictate the start and end days for these cities. The remaining cities must be sequenced such that:\n   - The city following Mykonos (on day 3) must have a direct flight from Mykonos and connect to Prague by day 7.\n   - The cities after Prague (from day 9 onwards) must be connected via direct flights and their durations must fit within the remaining days.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Fixed Events Handling**: Start with Mykonos (days 1-3) and Prague (days 7-9).\n   - **Intermediate City**: Zurich is chosen as it has direct flights from Mykonos and to Prague, fitting perfectly from day 3 to day 7.\n   - **Remaining Cities Sequence**: After Prague, the sequence Valencia \u2192 Bucharest \u2192 Riga \u2192 Nice is selected based on direct flight availability and duration constraints.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves a linear sequence of cities with constant time checks for direct flights, making the approach efficient with O(1) complexity for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 22\n    cities_order = ['Mykonos', 'Zurich', 'Prague', 'Valencia', 'Bucharest', 'Riga', 'Nice']\n    durations = {\n        'Mykonos': 3,\n        'Zurich': 5,\n        'Prague': 3,\n        'Valencia': 5,\n        'Bucharest': 5,\n        'Riga': 5,\n        'Nice': 2\n    }\n    fixed_events = {\n        'Mykonos': (1, 3),\n        'Prague': (7, 9)\n    }\n    direct_flights = [\n        ('Mykonos', 'Nice'),\n        ('Mykonos', 'Zurich'),\n        ('Prague', 'Bucharest'),\n        ('Valencia', 'Bucharest'),\n        ('Zurich', 'Prague'),\n        ('Riga', 'Nice'),\n        ('Zurich', 'Riga'),\n        ('Zurich', 'Bucharest'),\n        ('Zurich', 'Valencia'),\n        ('Bucharest', 'Riga'),\n        ('Prague', 'Riga'),\n        ('Prague', 'Valencia'),\n        ('Zurich', 'Nice')\n    ]\n    \n    graph = {}\n    for a, b in direct_flights:\n        if a not in graph:\n            graph[a] = set()\n        if b not in graph:\n            graph[b] = set()\n        graph[a].add(b)\n        graph[b].add(a)\n    \n    for i in range(len(cities_order) - 1):\n        from_city = cities_order[i]\n        to_city = cities_order[i+1]\n        if from_city not in graph or to_city not in graph[from_city]:\n            print(f\"No direct flight from {from_city} to {to_city}\")\n            return\n    \n    itinerary_list = []\n    current_day = 1\n    \n    for city in cities_order:\n        if city in fixed_events:\n            start, end = fixed_events[city]\n            itinerary_list.append((city, start, end))\n            current_day = end\n        else:\n            start = current_day\n            duration = durations[city]\n            end = start + duration - 1\n            itinerary_list.append((city, start, end))\n            current_day = end\n    \n    itinerary_json = {\"itinerary\": []}\n    for city, start, end in itinerary_list:\n        day_range = f\"Day {start}-{end}\"\n        itinerary_json[\"itinerary\"].append({\"day_range\": day_range, \"place\": city})\n    \n    print(json.dumps(itinerary_json))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The cities, their durations, fixed events, and direct flight connections are defined.\n2. **Flight Graph Construction**: A graph of direct flight connections is built to validate the sequence of cities.\n3. **Itinerary Construction**:\n   - Start with Mykonos (days 1-3) as per the fixed event.\n   - Proceed to Zurich (days 3-7) due to direct flights from Mykonos and to Prague.\n   - Move to Prague (days 7-9) as per the fixed event.\n   - Continue to Valencia (days 9-13), Bucharest (days 13-17), Riga (days 17-21), and Nice (days 21-22) based on direct flight availability.\n4. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON object with day ranges and city names, ensuring all constraints are met and direct flights connect consecutive cities.\n\nThis approach efficiently sequences the cities while respecting all given constraints and direct flight connections, resulting in an optimal 22-day itinerary."
