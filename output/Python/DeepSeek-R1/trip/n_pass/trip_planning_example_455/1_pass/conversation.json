        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to generate an optimal itinerary for visiting 5 European cities over 21 days, adhering to specific constraints such as direct flight connections between cities and meeting certain time-bound events in specific cities. The solution involves systematically exploring all possible permutations of city visits, ensuring each permutation meets the connectivity constraints (direct flights between consecutive cities) and the given time constraints for Riga and Istanbul.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting five cities (Reykjavik, Riga, Warsaw, Istanbul, Krakow) over 21 days with specific durations in each city. Direct flights between cities are predefined, and we must ensure the itinerary includes:\n   - A meeting in Riga between days 1 and 2.\n   - A wedding in Istanbul between days 2 and 7.\n   - The total days spent in each city must match the given constraints (7 days in Reykjavik, 2 in Riga, 3 in Warsaw, 6 in Istanbul, and 7 in Krakow).\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and direct flights as an undirected graph where each node is a city, and edges denote direct flight connections.\n\n3. **Permutation Generation**: Generate all permutations of the five cities to explore all possible visit orders. For each permutation:\n   - **Connectivity Check**: Ensure consecutive cities in the permutation are connected by a direct flight.\n   - **Day Calculation**: Compute the start and end days for each city block, considering that travel days are shared between consecutive cities (i.e., the last day in one city is the first day in the next).\n   - **Constraint Validation**: Verify that Riga is visited by day 2 and Istanbul is visited during days 2 to 7. Also, ensure the total trip ends on day 21.\n\n4. **Output Generation**: Once a valid permutation is found, format the itinerary as a JSON object listing each city along with its day range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    cities = ['Reykjavik', 'Riga', 'Warsaw', 'Istanbul', 'Krakow']\n    durations = {\n        'Reykjavik': 7,\n        'Riga': 2,\n        'Warsaw': 3,\n        'Istanbul': 6,\n        'Krakow': 7\n    }\n    graph = {\n        'Istanbul': ['Krakow', 'Warsaw', 'Riga'],\n        'Krakow': ['Istanbul', 'Warsaw'],\n        'Warsaw': ['Reykjavik', 'Istanbul', 'Krakow', 'Riga'],\n        'Riga': ['Istanbul', 'Warsaw'],\n        'Reykjavik': ['Warsaw']\n    }\n    \n    valid_itinerary = None\n    for path in itertools.permutations(cities):\n        valid_path = True\n        for i in range(len(path) - 1):\n            if path[i+1] not in graph[path[i]]:\n                valid_path = False\n                break\n        if not valid_path:\n            continue\n        \n        starts = []\n        ends = []\n        starts.append(1)\n        ends.append(1 + durations[path[0]] - 1)\n        for i in range(1, len(path)):\n            start_next = ends[i-1]\n            end_next = start_next + durations[path[i]] - 1\n            starts.append(start_next)\n            ends.append(end_next)\n        \n        if ends[-1] != 21:\n            continue\n            \n        idx_riga = path.index('Riga')\n        if starts[idx_riga] > 2:\n            continue\n            \n        idx_istanbul = path.index('Istanbul')\n        if starts[idx_istanbul] > 7 or ends[idx_istanbul] < 2:\n            continue\n            \n        valid_itinerary = (path, starts, ends)\n        break\n    \n    if valid_itinerary is None:\n        result = {\"itinerary\": []}\n    else:\n        path, starts, ends = valid_itinerary\n        itinerary_list = []\n        for i in range(len(path)):\n            day_range_str = f\"Day {starts[i]}-{ends[i]}\"\n            itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": path[i]})\n        result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    \n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Setup**: The graph is constructed where each city points to its directly connected cities. For example, Istanbul is connected to Krakow, Warsaw, and Riga.\n2. **Permutation Check**: The code generates all possible permutations of the five cities. For each permutation, it checks if consecutive cities have direct flights (using the graph).\n3. **Day Calculation**: For each valid permutation, the start and end days for each city block are calculated. The first city starts on day 1, and each subsequent city starts on the end day of the previous city (shared travel day).\n4. **Constraint Validation**: The solution ensures:\n   - Riga is visited by day 2 (i.e., its start day is \u2264 2).\n   - Istanbul is visited between days 2 and 7 (i.e., its start day is \u2264 7 and end day is \u2265 2).\n   - The total trip ends exactly on day 21.\n5. **Output**: The valid itinerary is formatted into a JSON object where each entry specifies the city and its day range. The result is printed as a JSON string.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible city sequences, validates constraints, and outputs the first valid itinerary meeting all requirements."
