        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to generate an optimal itinerary for visiting 6 European cities over 16 days, considering specific constraints on the duration of stay in each city, direct flight connections, and certain date-specific events. The solution involves systematically checking all possible permutations of the cities to find a sequence that satisfies all given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting 6 cities (Dubrovnik, Split, Milan, Porto, Krakow, Munich) over 16 days. Each city has a specific duration of stay, and there are constraints related to events in certain cities during specific date ranges. Direct flights between cities are provided, and travel days are counted in both the departing and arriving cities.\n\n2. **Key Constraints**:\n   - **Dubrovnik**: 4 days\n   - **Split**: 3 days\n   - **Milan**: 3 days, with a wedding between days 11-13\n   - **Porto**: 4 days\n   - **Krakow**: 2 days, with a meeting between days 8-9\n   - **Munich**: 5 days, with an annual show between days 4-8\n   - Direct flights between specific city pairs must be used for travel.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Permutations**: Generate all possible sequences of the 6 cities (720 permutations) to explore every possible order of visits.\n   - **Graph Representation**: Represent the direct flight connections as an undirected graph to validate consecutive city pairs in each permutation.\n   - **Date Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the start and end days for each city's stay, ensuring the total days sum to 16 and accounting for travel days (each travel day is counted in two cities).\n   - **Constraint Checking**: Verify that the stays in Munich, Krakow, and Milan overlap with their respective event date ranges.\n\n4. **Optimization**: The algorithm stops at the first valid permutation that meets all constraints, ensuring efficiency given the manageable number of permutations (720).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    cities = ['Dubrovnik', 'Split', 'Milan', 'Porto', 'Krakow', 'Munich']\n    durations = {\n        'Dubrovnik': 4,\n        'Split': 3,\n        'Milan': 3,\n        'Porto': 4,\n        'Krakow': 2,\n        'Munich': 5\n    }\n    \n    flight_pairs = [\n        ('Munich', 'Porto'),\n        ('Split', 'Milan'),\n        ('Milan', 'Porto'),\n        ('Munich', 'Krakow'),\n        ('Munich', 'Milan'),\n        ('Dubrovnik', 'Munich'),\n        ('Krakow', 'Split'),\n        ('Krakow', 'Milan'),\n        ('Munich', 'Split')\n    ]\n    \n    graph = {}\n    for u, v in flight_pairs:\n        if u not in graph:\n            graph[u] = set()\n        graph[u].add(v)\n        if v not in graph:\n            graph[v] = set()\n        graph[v].add(u)\n    \n    found = False\n    result_itinerary = None\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(cities):\n        valid_flight = True\n        for i in range(len(perm)-1):\n            city1 = perm[i]\n            city2 = perm[i+1]\n            if city2 not in graph.get(city1, set()):\n                valid_flight = False\n                break\n        if not valid_flight:\n            continue\n        \n        durs = [durations[city] for city in perm]\n        starts = [1]\n        for i in range(len(perm)-1):\n            next_start = starts[i] + durs[i] - 1\n            starts.append(next_start)\n        ends = [starts[i] + durs[i] - 1 for i in range(len(perm))]\n        \n        if ends[-1] != 16:\n            continue\n        \n        idx_mu = perm.index('Munich')\n        s_mu = starts[idx_mu]\n        e_mu = ends[idx_mu]\n        if not (s_mu <= 8 and e_mu >= 4):\n            continue\n        \n        idx_k = perm.index('Krakow')\n        s_k = starts[idx_k]\n        e_k = ends[idx_k]\n        if not (s_k <= 9 and e_k >= 8):\n            continue\n        \n        idx_mi = perm.index('Milan')\n        s_mi = starts[idx_mi]\n        e_mi = ends[idx_mi]\n        if not (s_mi <= 13 and e_mi >= 11):\n            continue\n        \n        itinerary_list = []\n        for i in range(len(perm)):\n            s = starts[i]\n            e = ends[i]\n            if s == e:\n                day_str = f\"Day {s}\"\n            else:\n                day_str = f\"Day {s}-{e}\"\n            itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": day_str, \"place\": perm[i]})\n        found = True\n        result_itinerary = itinerary_list\n        break\n    \n    if found:\n        print(json.dumps({\"itinerary\": result_itinerary}))\n    else:\n        print(json.dumps({\"itinerary\": []}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The cities and their respective stay durations are defined. Direct flight pairs are listed to build a graph representing valid flight connections.\n2. **Graph Construction**: The flight pairs are used to create an adjacency list where each city points to its directly connected cities.\n3. **Permutation Check**: All permutations of the cities are generated. For each permutation:\n   - **Flight Validation**: Consecutive cities in the permutation are checked for direct flight connections.\n   - **Date Calculation**: Start and end days for each city's stay are computed. The end day of the last city must be day 16.\n   - **Constraint Validation**: The stays in Munich, Krakow, and Milan are checked to ensure they overlap with their respective event date ranges (days 4-8, 8-9, and 11-13).\n4. **Output**: The first valid itinerary found is printed as a JSON object. If no valid itinerary is found, an empty itinerary is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible city sequences, ensuring the solution meets all given constraints while leveraging direct flight connections and accounting for travel days."
