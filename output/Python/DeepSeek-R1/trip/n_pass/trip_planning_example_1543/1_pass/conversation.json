        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting 10 European cities over 26 days, considering specific constraints for certain cities and ensuring direct flights between consecutive cities. The solution involves defining the sequence of cities, their stay durations, and verifying that all constraints and flight connections are satisfied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Constraints and Direct Flights**: We start by defining the constraints for each city (such as required stay durations and specific date ranges for events) and the list of available direct flights between cities.\n2. **Plan the Itinerary**: Based on the constraints, we devise a sequence of city visits with start and end days. This sequence ensures that:\n   - The total trip duration is 26 days.\n   - Each city's stay duration matches its requirement.\n   - Specific events in cities like Prague, London, Lisbon, Porto, and Warsaw occur within their specified date ranges.\n   - Consecutive cities in the sequence are connected by direct flights.\n3. **Verification**: We verify the itinerary by:\n   - Ensuring direct flights exist between consecutive cities.\n   - Checking that cities with constraints (Prague, London, Lisbon, Porto, Warsaw) have stays within their required date ranges.\n   - Confirming that each city's stay duration matches its specified requirement.\n   - Ensuring the trip ends on day 26.\n4. **Output the Itinerary**: Finally, we format the itinerary as a JSON object with day ranges and corresponding cities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 26\n    cities = {\n        \"Prague\": {\"days\": 3, \"constraint\": (1, 3)},\n        \"Warsaw\": {\"days\": 4, \"constraint\": (20, 23)},\n        \"Dublin\": {\"days\": 3, \"constraint\": None},\n        \"Athens\": {\"days\": 3, \"constraint\": None},\n        \"Vilnius\": {\"days\": 4, \"constraint\": None},\n        \"Porto\": {\"days\": 5, \"constraint\": (16, 20)},\n        \"London\": {\"days\": 3, \"constraint\": (3, 5)},\n        \"Seville\": {\"days\": 2, \"constraint\": None},\n        \"Lisbon\": {\"days\": 5, \"constraint\": (5, 9)},\n        \"Dubrovnik\": {\"days\": 3, \"constraint\": None}\n    }\n\n    direct_flights = [\n        (\"Warsaw\", \"Vilnius\"),\n        (\"Prague\", \"Athens\"),\n        (\"London\", \"Lisbon\"),\n        (\"Lisbon\", \"Porto\"),\n        (\"Prague\", \"Lisbon\"),\n        (\"London\", \"Dublin\"),\n        (\"Athens\", \"Vilnius\"),\n        (\"Athens\", \"Dublin\"),\n        (\"Prague\", \"London\"),\n        (\"London\", \"Warsaw\"),\n        (\"Dublin\", \"Seville\"),\n        (\"Seville\", \"Porto\"),\n        (\"Lisbon\", \"Athens\"),\n        (\"Dublin\", \"Porto\"),\n        (\"Athens\", \"Warsaw\"),\n        (\"Lisbon\", \"Warsaw\"),\n        (\"Porto\", \"Warsaw\"),\n        (\"Prague\", \"Warsaw\"),\n        (\"Prague\", \"Dublin\"),\n        (\"Athens\", \"Dubrovnik\"),\n        (\"Lisbon\", \"Dublin\"),\n        (\"Dubrovnik\", \"Dublin\"),\n        (\"Lisbon\", \"Seville\"),\n        (\"London\", \"Athens\")\n    ]\n\n    city_sequence = [\n        (\"Prague\", 1, 3),\n        (\"London\", 3, 5),\n        (\"Lisbon\", 5, 9),\n        (\"Athens\", 9, 11),\n        (\"Dubrovnik\", 11, 13),\n        (\"Dublin\", 13, 15),\n        (\"Seville\", 15, 16),\n        (\"Porto\", 16, 20),\n        (\"Warsaw\", 20, 23),\n        (\"Vilnius\", 23, 26)\n    ]\n\n    graph = {}\n    for city1, city2 in direct_flights:\n        if city1 not in graph:\n            graph[city1] = set()\n        graph[city1].add(city2)\n        if city2 not in graph:\n            graph[city2] = set()\n        graph[city2].add(city1)\n    \n    for i in range(len(city_sequence) - 1):\n        city1 = city_sequence[i][0]\n        city2 = city_sequence[i+1][0]\n        if city1 in graph and city2 in graph[city1]:\n            continue\n        elif city2 in graph and city1 in graph[city2]:\n            continue\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"No direct flight found between {city1} and {city2}\")\n\n    for city, start, end in city_sequence:\n        constraint = cities[city].get(\"constraint\")\n        if constraint is not None:\n            a, b = constraint\n            if end < a or start > b:\n                raise ValueError(f\"Constraint for {city} not satisfied: stay from {start} to {end} not within [{a}, {b}]\")\n\n    for city, start, end in city_sequence:\n        required_days = cities[city][\"days\"]\n        actual_days = end - start + 1\n        if actual_days != required_days:\n            raise ValueError(f\"City {city} has {actual_days} days, but requires {required_days} days\")\n\n    if city_sequence[-1][2] != total_days:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Last day is {city_sequence[-1][2]}, but should be {total_days}\")\n\n    itinerary_list = []\n    for city, start, end in city_sequence:\n        itinerary_list.append({\n            \"day_range\": f\"Day {start}-{end}\",\n            \"place\": city\n        })\n\n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Constraints and Flights**: The code starts by defining the cities with their respective stay durations and any date constraints. It also lists all available direct flights between cities.\n2. **Itinerary Sequence**: The `city_sequence` list outlines the planned itinerary, specifying the start and end days for each city visit. This sequence is designed to meet all constraints and ensure logical transitions between cities.\n3. **Flight Verification**: The code checks if consecutive cities in the sequence have direct flights by building a graph of flight connections and verifying each transition.\n4. **Constraint Verification**: For cities with specific date constraints (Prague, London, Lisbon, Porto, Warsaw), the code checks if their stays fall within the required date ranges.\n5. **Duration Verification**: The actual stay duration for each city is compared against the required duration to ensure compliance.\n6. **Total Days Check**: The code confirms that the trip ends on day 26.\n7. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted into a JSON object where each entry specifies the day range and corresponding city, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all given constraints are met, the itinerary is feasible with available flights, and the total trip duration is exactly 26 days. The solution efficiently verifies each aspect of the itinerary before outputting the final plan."
