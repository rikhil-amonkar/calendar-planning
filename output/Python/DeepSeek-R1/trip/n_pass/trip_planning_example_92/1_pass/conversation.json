You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Riga for 5 days. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 7 days.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal itinerary for visiting three European cities\u2014Dublin, Riga, and Vilnius\u2014over a total of 12 days, considering direct flight constraints between the cities. The itinerary must account for the specified days spent in each city and ensure that travel days are correctly included in the day counts for both departure and arrival cities.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves planning a trip itinerary where:\n   - The total trip duration is 12 days.\n   - Specific days are allocated for each city: Riga (5 days), Vilnius (7 days), and Dublin (2 days).\n   - Direct flights exist only between Dublin and Riga, and between Riga and Vilnius. There are no direct flights between Dublin and Vilnius.\n   - Travel days are counted in both the departure and arrival cities. For example, flying from Dublin to Riga on day X means day X is counted in both Dublin and Riga.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and direct flights as an undirected graph. Each city is a node, and each direct flight is an undirected edge between two cities.\n\n3. **Valid Paths Generation**: Generate all possible permutations of the three cities. For each permutation, check if consecutive cities in the permutation have a direct flight connection (edge in the graph). This ensures the itinerary only uses available direct flights.\n\n4. **Path Selection**: Among all valid paths, select the path that starts with the city having the fewest days. This heuristic helps in optimizing the itinerary by starting with the shortest stay.\n\n5. **Itinerary Construction**: For the selected path:\n   - Start the first city on day 1.\n   - Each subsequent city starts on the same day the previous city ends (since travel days are shared).\n   - The end day for each city is calculated as `start_day + allocated_days - 1`.\n   - The last city's end day must match the total trip duration (12 days).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 12\n    city_days = {\n        'Riga': 5,\n        'Vilnius': 7,\n        'Dublin': 2\n    }\n    direct_flights = [('Dublin', 'Riga'), ('Riga', 'Vilnius')]\n    \n    graph = {}\n    for (u, v) in direct_flights:\n        if u not in graph:\n            graph[u] = set()\n        graph[u].add(v)\n        if v not in graph:\n            graph[v] = set()\n        graph[v].add(u)\n    \n    cities_list = list(city_days.keys())\n    valid_paths = []\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(cities_list):\n        valid = True\n        n = len(perm)\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            u = perm[i]\n            v = perm[i+1]\n            if u in graph and v in graph[u]:\n                continue\n            else:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            valid_paths.append(perm)\n    \n    if not valid_paths:\n        result = {\"itinerary\": []}\n    else:\n        valid_paths.sort(key=lambda path: city_days[path[0]])\n        chosen_path = valid_paths[0]\n        \n        current_start = 1\n        itinerary_list = []\n        for city in chosen_path:\n            d = city_days[city]\n            end = current_start + d - 1\n            itinerary_list.append({\n                \"day_range\": f\"Day {current_start}-{end}\",\n                \"place\": city\n            })\n            current_start = end\n        \n        if end != total_days:\n            result = {\"itinerary\": []}\n        else:\n            result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    \n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Construction**: The direct flights between cities are used to build an undirected graph. Each city is a node, and each flight route is an edge connecting two nodes.\n2. **Path Validation**: All permutations of the three cities are generated. Each permutation is checked to ensure consecutive cities have a direct flight (edge in the graph).\n3. **Path Selection**: Valid paths are sorted based on the days required for the starting city. The path starting with the city having the fewest days is chosen to optimize the itinerary.\n4. **Itinerary Construction**: \n   - The first city starts on day 1 and ends on `start_day + allocated_days - 1`.\n   - The next city starts on the same day the previous city ends (due to shared travel days).\n   - This process repeats for all cities in the selected path.\n   - The final city's end day must equal the total trip duration (12 days); otherwise, the itinerary is invalid.\n5. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON object with day ranges for each city, ensuring the output meets the specified structure.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes a valid itinerary by leveraging graph theory for connectivity checks and heuristic-based path selection for optimization. The solution ensures all constraints are met, including direct flight availability and accurate day counting."
