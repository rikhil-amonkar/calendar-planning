You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 2 days in Oslo. You want to meet a friend in Oslo between day 24 and day 25. You plan to stay in Helsinki for 2 days.

You want to spend 4 days in Geneva.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPorto and Oslo, Edinburgh and Budapest, Edinburgh and Geneva, from Riga to Tallinn, Edinburgh and Porto, Vilnius and Helsinki, from Tallinn to Vilnius, Riga and Oslo, Geneva and Oslo, Edinburgh and Oslo, Edinburgh and Helsinki, Vilnius and Oslo, Riga and Helsinki, Budapest and Geneva, Helsinki and Budapest, Helsinki and Oslo, Edinburgh and Riga, Tallinn and Helsinki, Geneva and Porto, Budapest and Oslo, Helsinki and Geneva, from Riga to Vilnius, Tallinn and Oslo.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to generate an optimal 25-day itinerary for visiting 9 European cities, adhering to specific constraints on the duration of stay in each city and direct flight availability between them. The solution involves constructing a directed flight graph, validating permutations of city sequences against constraints, and computing the day ranges for each city stay.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Construction**: Represent the cities and direct flights as a directed graph. Bidirectional flights are added as edges in both directions, while directed flights are added in the specified direction.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: \n   - **Oslo Constraint**: Oslo must be visited either on the last two days (days 24-25) or the second last with the last city being Helsinki or Riga.\n   - **Tallinn Constraint**: The stay in Tallinn must include at least one day between days 4 and 8.\n3. **Permutation Validation**: Generate all permutations of the 9 cities. For each permutation:\n   - **Path Validation**: Ensure consecutive cities in the permutation have a direct flight.\n   - **Oslo Position Check**: Verify Oslo is either last or second last (with the last city being Helsinki or Riga).\n   - **Tallinn Timing Check**: Ensure Tallinn's stay starts early enough to include a day between 4 and 8.\n4. **Itinerary Calculation**: For the valid permutation, compute start and end days for each city stay, considering travel days are counted in both departure and arrival cities.\n5. **Output**: Format the itinerary as a JSON dictionary with day ranges for each city.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    durations = {\n        'Oslo': 2,\n        'Helsinki': 2,\n        'Edinburgh': 3,\n        'Riga': 2,\n        'Tallinn': 5,\n        'Budapest': 5,\n        'Vilnius': 5,\n        'Porto': 5,\n        'Geneva': 4\n    }\n    \n    cities = list(durations.keys())\n    \n    bidirectional_pairs = [\n        ('Porto', 'Oslo'),\n        ('Edinburgh', 'Budapest'),\n        ('Edinburgh', 'Geneva'),\n        ('Edinburgh', 'Porto'),\n        ('Vilnius', 'Helsinki'),\n        ('Riga', 'Oslo'),\n        ('Geneva', 'Oslo'),\n        ('Edinburgh', 'Oslo'),\n        ('Edinburgh', 'Helsinki'),\n        ('Vilnius', 'Oslo'),\n        ('Riga', 'Helsinki'),\n        ('Budapest', 'Geneva'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Budapest'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Oslo'),\n        ('Edinburgh', 'Riga'),\n        ('Tallinn', 'Helsinki'),\n        ('Geneva', 'Porto'),\n        ('Budapest', 'Oslo'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Geneva'),\n        ('Tallinn', 'Oslo')\n    ]\n    \n    directed_edges = [\n        ('Riga', 'Tallinn'),\n        ('Tallinn', 'Vilnius'),\n        ('Riga', 'Vilnius')\n    ]\n    \n    graph = {city: set() for city in cities}\n    for (a, b) in bidirectional_pairs:\n        graph[a].add(b)\n        graph[b].add(a)\n    for (a, b) in directed_edges:\n        graph[a].add(b)\n    \n    found_perm = None\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(cities):\n        valid_path = True\n        for i in range(8):\n            if perm[i+1] not in graph[perm[i]]:\n                valid_path = False\n                break\n        if not valid_path:\n            continue\n            \n        if perm[8] == 'Oslo':\n            pass\n        elif perm[7] == 'Oslo' and perm[8] in ['Helsinki', 'Riga']:\n            pass\n        else:\n            continue\n            \n        k = perm.index('Tallinn')\n        if k == 0:\n            found_perm = perm\n            break\n        else:\n            total_prev = sum(durations[perm[j]] for j in range(k))\n            S = total_prev - (k - 1)\n            if S <= 8:\n                found_perm = perm\n                break\n    \n    if found_perm is None:\n        print(json.dumps({\"itinerary\": []}))\n        return\n    \n    starts = [0] * 9\n    ends = [0] * 9\n    starts[0] = 1\n    ends[0] = starts[0] + durations[found_perm[0]] - 1\n    for i in range(1, 9):\n        starts[i] = ends[i-1]\n        ends[i] = starts[i] + durations[found_perm[i]] - 1\n    \n    itinerary_list = []\n    for i in range(9):\n        s = starts[i]\n        e = ends[i]\n        if s == e:\n            day_range_str = f\"Day {s}\"\n        else:\n            day_range_str = f\"Day {s}-{e}\"\n        itinerary_list.append({\n            \"day_range\": day_range_str,\n            \"place\": found_perm[i]\n        })\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Construction**: The directed flight graph is built using bidirectional and directed flight information. Each city is a node, and edges represent direct flights.\n2. **Permutation Validation**: All permutations of cities are generated. Each permutation is checked for:\n   - **Flight Path Validity**: Consecutive cities must have a direct flight.\n   - **Oslo Position**: Oslo must be the last city or the second last with Helsinki or Riga as the last city.\n   - **Tallinn Timing**: Tallinn's stay must start early enough (by day 8) to include a day between days 4 and 8.\n3. **Itinerary Calculation**: For the valid permutation, start and end days for each city stay are computed. The start day of each subsequent city is the end day of the previous city, accounting for travel days.\n4. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON dictionary with day ranges for each city, printed as the final output. This solution efficiently checks all constraints and computes the optimal itinerary using permutation validation and graph traversal."
