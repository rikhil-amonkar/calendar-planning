You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 2 days in Oslo. From day 16 to day 17, there is a annual show you want to attend in Oslo.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting 8 European cities over 20 days, considering specific constraints on the duration of stay in each city, fixed events on certain days, and direct flight connections between cities. The solution involves determining the sequence of cities that satisfies all constraints and then generating a day-by-day itinerary.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting 8 cities (Oslo, Reykjavik, Stockholm, Munich, Frankfurt, Barcelona, Bucharest, Split) over 20 days. Each city has a specific duration of stay, and certain cities have fixed events on particular days. The itinerary must respect direct flight connections between consecutive cities.\n2. **Key Constraints**:\n   - Oslo: Must be visited for exactly 2 days, including days 16 and 17.\n   - Reykjavik: 5 days with at least one day between days 9 and 13.\n   - Munich: 4 days with at least one day between days 13 and 16.\n   - Frankfurt: 4 days with at least one day between days 17 and 20.\n   - Other cities have fixed durations without specific day constraints.\n3. **Flight Connections**: Only direct flights between certain city pairs are allowed. The solution must ensure consecutive cities in the itinerary have a direct flight.\n4. **Itinerary Calculation**: The itinerary is constructed by:\n   - **Ordering Cities**: The cities are ordered such that all constraints are met, and consecutive cities have direct flights.\n   - **Day Allocation**: For each city, the start day is determined based on the end day of the previous city. The duration of stay is used to compute the end day.\n5. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON object with day ranges for each city.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    durations = {\n        \"Bucharest\": 2,\n        \"Barcelona\": 3,\n        \"Split\": 3,\n        \"Stockholm\": 4,\n        \"Reykjavik\": 5,\n        \"Munich\": 4,\n        \"Oslo\": 2,\n        \"Frankfurt\": 4\n    }\n    \n    city_order = [\n        \"Bucharest\",\n        \"Barcelona\",\n        \"Split\",\n        \"Stockholm\",\n        \"Reykjavik\",\n        \"Munich\",\n        \"Oslo\",\n        \"Frankfurt\"\n    ]\n    \n    current_start = 1\n    itinerary_list = []\n    \n    for city in city_order:\n        d = durations[city]\n        end_day = current_start + d - 1\n        day_range_str = f\"Day {current_start}-{end_day}\"\n        itinerary_list.append({\n            \"day_range\": day_range_str,\n            \"place\": city\n        })\n        current_start = end_day\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The `durations` dictionary specifies the number of days to spend in each city.\n2. **City Order**: The `city_order` list defines the sequence of cities, ensuring all constraints are met and consecutive cities have direct flights (as verified during problem analysis).\n3. **Itinerary Construction**:\n   - Start with day 1.\n   - For each city in `city_order`, calculate the end day by adding its duration minus one to the start day.\n   - Record the day range (start to end) for the city.\n   - The next city starts on the same day the previous city ends (accounting for travel days).\n4. **Output**: The itinerary is printed as a JSON object with the day ranges for each city.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs a valid itinerary by leveraging predefined city order and durations, ensuring all constraints and flight connections are satisfied. The solution outputs a structured JSON object that clearly maps day ranges to cities."
