        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting five European cities over 20 days, adhering to specific constraints on the duration of stay in each city and the availability of direct flights between them. The solution involves generating a sequence of city visits that satisfies all given constraints, including fixed stay durations and flight connections.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves planning a trip to five cities (Nice, Krakow, Dublin, Lyon, Frankfurt) over 20 days with specific stay durations:\n   - Nice: 5 days (must be between days 1 and 5)\n   - Krakow: 6 days\n   - Dublin: 7 days\n   - Lyon: 4 days\n   - Frankfurt: 2 days (must be on days 19 and 20)\n\n2. **Flight Connections**: Direct flights exist between:\n   - Nice and Dublin, Nice and Frankfurt, Nice and Lyon\n   - Dublin and Frankfurt, Dublin and Krakow, Dublin and Lyon\n   - Krakow and Frankfurt\n   - Lyon and Frankfurt\n\n3. **Key Constraints**:\n   - The stay in Nice must be from day 1 to day 5.\n   - The stay in Frankfurt must be on days 19 and 20.\n   - Travel days are shared between cities (e.g., flying from city A to city B on day X means day X counts for both cities).\n\n4. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Fixed Blocks**: Assign Nice to days 1-5 and Frankfurt to days 19-20.\n   - **Permutations for Remaining Cities**: Generate all permutations of the remaining cities (Krakow, Dublin, Lyon) and check for valid flight connections between consecutive cities, including connections from Nice to the first city and from the last city to Frankfurt.\n   - **Duration Calculation**: For each valid permutation, calculate the start and end days for each city stay, ensuring the sequence fits within days 5 to 19.\n\n5. **Output**: Format the itinerary as a JSON dictionary with day ranges and corresponding cities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    cities = {\n        \"Nice\": {\"duration\": 5},\n        \"Krakow\": {\"duration\": 6},\n        \"Dublin\": {\"duration\": 7},\n        \"Lyon\": {\"duration\": 4},\n        \"Frankfurt\": {\"duration\": 2}\n    }\n    \n    flights_graph = {\n        \"Nice\": [\"Dublin\", \"Frankfurt\", \"Lyon\"],\n        \"Dublin\": [\"Nice\", \"Frankfurt\", \"Krakow\", \"Lyon\"],\n        \"Krakow\": [\"Dublin\", \"Frankfurt\"],\n        \"Frankfurt\": [\"Dublin\", \"Krakow\", \"Lyon\", \"Nice\"],\n        \"Lyon\": [\"Frankfurt\", \"Dublin\", \"Nice\"]\n    }\n    \n    remaining_cities = [\"Lyon\", \"Dublin\", \"Krakow\"]\n    \n    valid_permutation = None\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(remaining_cities):\n        if perm[0] not in flights_graph[\"Nice\"]:\n            continue\n        if perm[2] not in flights_graph[\"Frankfurt\"]:\n            continue\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(len(perm)-1):\n            if perm[i+1] not in flights_graph[perm[i]]:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            valid_permutation = perm\n            break\n            \n    if valid_permutation is None:\n        print(json.dumps({\"itinerary\": []}))\n        return\n        \n    itinerary_blocks = []\n    itinerary_blocks.append({\"place\": \"Nice\", \"start\": 1, \"end\": 5})\n    current_day = 5\n    for city in valid_permutation:\n        duration = cities[city][\"duration\"]\n        end_day = current_day + duration - 1\n        itinerary_blocks.append({\"place\": city, \"start\": current_day, \"end\": end_day})\n        current_day = end_day\n        \n    itinerary_blocks.append({\"place\": \"Frankfurt\", \"start\": 19, \"end\": 20})\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": []}\n    for block in itinerary_blocks:\n        day_range_str = f\"Day {block['start']}-{block['end']}\"\n        result[\"itinerary\"].append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": block[\"place\"]})\n        \n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The cities and their respective stay durations are defined. The flight connections between cities are represented as a graph.\n2. **Permutations Check**: The code generates all permutations of the remaining cities (Lyon, Dublin, Krakow) and checks for valid flight connections:\n   - From Nice to the first city in the permutation.\n   - Between consecutive cities in the permutation.\n   - From the last city in the permutation to Frankfurt.\n3. **Itinerary Construction**: For the valid permutation found (Lyon \u2192 Dublin \u2192 Krakow), the start and end days for each city stay are calculated:\n   - Nice: Days 1-5.\n   - Lyon: Days 5-8 (shared travel day on day 5).\n   - Dublin: Days 8-14 (shared travel day on day 8).\n   - Krakow: Days 14-19 (shared travel day on day 14).\n   - Frankfurt: Days 19-20 (shared travel day on day 19).\n4. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted into a JSON dictionary with day ranges and corresponding cities, printed as the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible city sequences, ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints and flight availability, resulting in an optimal travel plan."
