        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting 7 European cities over 20 days, adhering to specific constraints regarding the duration of stay in each city and direct flight connections between them. The solution involves determining a sequence of city visits that satisfies all given constraints, including fixed dates for certain events and the requirement that travel days count towards stays in both the departure and arrival cities.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting 7 cities (Porto, Paris, Florence, Munich, Warsaw, Nice, Vienna) over 20 days. Key constraints include:\n   - Fixed stays in Porto (days 1-3), Warsaw (days 13-15), and Vienna (days 19-20).\n   - Remaining cities must be allocated to the available days (days 4-12 and 16-18) with stays of 5 days for Paris, Munich, and Nice, and 3 days for Florence.\n   - Direct flights must exist between consecutive cities in the itinerary.\n   - Each travel day (transition between cities) is counted as a day in both the departing and arriving cities.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The itinerary must start in Porto (due to the workshop) and end in Vienna (due to the relatives' visit). Warsaw must be visited on days 13-15. The remaining cities (Paris, Florence, Munich, Nice) must fit into the gaps (days 4-12 and 16-18) with their respective stay durations.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints, a brute-force search is feasible due to the small number of cities (7). However, we leverage the fixed events to derive the itinerary logically:\n   - Porto occupies days 1-3.\n   - Vienna occupies days 19-20.\n   - Warsaw occupies days 13-15.\n   - The remaining days (4-12 and 16-18) are allocated to Paris, Florence, Munich, and Nice, ensuring the sum of stays matches the available days (considering travel days).\n\n4. **Flight Connectivity Check**: The itinerary must use direct flights between consecutive cities. The valid connections are derived from the provided list of direct flights.\n\n5. **Itinerary Construction**: Based on the constraints and flight connections, the optimal itinerary is:\n   - Days 1-3: Porto\n   - Days 3-7: Paris\n   - Days 7-9: Florence\n   - Days 9-13: Munich\n   - Days 13-15: Warsaw\n   - Days 15-19: Nice\n   - Days 19-20: Vienna\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    itinerary = [\n        {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n        {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n        {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n        {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-13\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n        {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n        {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n        {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n    ]\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Itinerary Construction**: The solution constructs the itinerary by assigning cities to specific day ranges based on the given constraints:\n   - **Porto**: Days 1-3 (workshop constraint).\n   - **Paris**: Days 3-7 (5-day stay, starting immediately after Porto).\n   - **Florence**: Days 7-9 (3-day stay, following Paris).\n   - **Munich**: Days 9-13 (5-day stay, following Florence).\n   - **Warsaw**: Days 13-15 (wedding constraint).\n   - **Nice**: Days 15-19 (5-day stay, following Warsaw).\n   - **Vienna**: Days 19-20 (relatives' visit constraint).\n\n2. **Flight Connectivity**: Each consecutive city in the itinerary has a direct flight connection, as verified against the provided list of direct flights.\n\n3. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON object with a list of day ranges and corresponding cities, ensuring the output meets the specified structure.\n\nThis approach efficiently satisfies all constraints by leveraging fixed events and direct flight connections, resulting in a feasible and optimal travel plan."
