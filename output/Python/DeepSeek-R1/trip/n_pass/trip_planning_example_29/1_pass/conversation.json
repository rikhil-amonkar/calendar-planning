You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 2 days in Krakow. You are going to attend a wedding in Krakow between day 9 and day 10. You plan to stay in Dubrovnik for 7 days.

Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal itinerary for visiting three European cities (Dubrovnik, Frankfurt, and Krakow) over 10 days, considering direct flight constraints and specific stay durations in each city. The key constraints are:\n1. Spend 2 days in Krakow, including the wedding between days 9 and 10.\n2. Spend 7 days in Dubrovnik.\n3. Spend 3 days in Frankfurt.\n4. Only direct flights between Frankfurt-Krakow and Dubrovnik-Frankfurt are available.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Fixed Segments**: The wedding in Krakow must cover days 9 and 10, so the Krakow segment is fixed as days 9-10.\n2. **Frankfurt Segment**: Since the flight from Frankfurt to Krakow occurs on day 9, the Frankfurt segment must end on day 9. Given 3 days in Frankfurt, the segment starts on day 7 (9 - 3 + 1 = 7).\n3. **Dubrovnik Segment**: The flight from Dubrovnik to Frankfurt occurs on day 7, so the Dubrovnik segment ends on day 7. Given 7 days in Dubrovnik, the segment starts on day 1 (7 - 7 + 1 = 1).\n4. **Itinerary Construction**: The itinerary is constructed by combining these segments:\n   - Dubrovnik: Days 1-7\n   - Frankfurt: Days 7-9\n   - Krakow: Days 9-10\n\nThis approach ensures all constraints are met, leveraging direct flights and overlapping travel days where necessary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    total_days = 10\n    wedding_city = \"Krakow\"\n    wedding_start = 9\n    wedding_end = 10\n    \n    city_days = {\n        \"Dubrovnik\": 7,\n        \"Frankfurt\": 3,\n        \"Krakow\": 2\n    }\n    \n    route_order = [\"Dubrovnik\", \"Frankfurt\", \"Krakow\"]\n    \n    segments = []\n    \n    krakow_start = wedding_start\n    krakow_end = wedding_end\n    segments.append((\"Krakow\", krakow_start, krakow_end))\n    \n    frankfurt_end = krakow_start\n    frankfurt_days = city_days[\"Frankfurt\"]\n    frankfurt_start = frankfurt_end - frankfurt_days + 1\n    segments.insert(0, (\"Frankfurt\", frankfurt_start, frankfurt_end))\n    \n    dubrovnik_end = frankfurt_start\n    dubrovnik_days = city_days[\"Dubrovnik\"]\n    dubrovnik_start = dubrovnik_end - dubrovnik_days + 1\n    segments.insert(0, (\"Dubrovnik\", dubrovnik_start, dubrovnik_end))\n    \n    itinerary_list = []\n    for city, start, end in segments:\n        day_range_str = f\"Day {start}-{end}\"\n        itinerary_list.append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": city})\n    \n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary_list}\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fixed Segments**: The Krakow segment is set to days 9-10 to cover the wedding.\n2. **Frankfurt Calculation**: The Frankfurt segment ends on day 9 (when flying to Krakow). With 3 days required, it starts on day 7 (9 - 3 + 1 = 7).\n3. **Dubrovnik Calculation**: The Dubrovnik segment ends on day 7 (when flying to Frankfurt). With 7 days required, it starts on day 1 (7 - 7 + 1 = 1).\n4. **Itinerary Construction**: The segments are combined into an itinerary list with day ranges and corresponding cities.\n5. **Output**: The itinerary is printed as a JSON object with the structure `{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"City\"}, ...]}`.\n\nThis approach efficiently meets all constraints by leveraging direct flights and overlapping travel days, ensuring optimal use of the 10-day trip."
