        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal meeting schedule that allows us to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering their availability and travel times between locations. The solution involves calculating the best sequence of meetings while accounting for travel times and ensuring each meeting meets the minimum duration constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires scheduling meetings with friends at different locations, considering their availability windows and minimum meeting durations. The challenge is to maximize the number of meetings while respecting travel times between locations.\n2. **Key Insights**: \n   - **Travel Times**: Predefined travel times between locations must be considered when moving from one meeting to the next.\n   - **Time Windows**: Each friend has a specific time window during which they are available, and meetings must start and end within these windows.\n   - **Minimum Durations**: Each meeting must last at least the specified minimum duration.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Greedy Scheduling**: We schedule meetings in a sequence that minimizes travel time and waiting time, starting from the initial location (Fisherman's Wharf).\n   - **Time Conversion**: Convert all times to minutes past midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n   - **Simulation**: For each friend in the planned order, calculate the arrival time, adjust for the friend's availability, and schedule the meeting if feasible.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves a linear pass through the list of friends to schedule meetings, making the complexity O(n), where n is the number of friends. The travel time lookup is O(1) due to the use of a dictionary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\ntravel_times = {\n    \"Fisherman's Wharf\": {\n        \"The Castro\": 26,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 25,\n        \"Embarcadero\": 8,\n        \"Russian Hill\": 7,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 11,\n        \"Alamo Square\": 20,\n        \"North Beach\": 6\n    },\n    \"The Castro\": {\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 24,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 11,\n        \"Embarcadero\": 22,\n        \"Russian Hill\": 18,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 16,\n        \"Alamo Square\": 8,\n        \"North Beach\": 20\n    },\n    \"Golden Gate Park\": {\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 24,\n        \"The Castro\": 13,\n        \"Embarcadero\": 25,\n        \"Russian Hill\": 19,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 20,\n        \"Alamo Square\": 10,\n        \"North Beach\": 24\n    },\n    \"Embarcadero\": {\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 6,\n        \"The Castro\": 25,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 25,\n        \"Russian Hill\": 8,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 10,\n        \"Alamo Square\": 19,\n        \"North Beach\": 5\n    },\n    \"Russian Hill\": {\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 7,\n        \"The Castro\": 21,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 21,\n        \"Embarcadero\": 8,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 5,\n        \"Alamo Square\": 15,\n        \"North Beach\": 5\n    },\n    \"Nob Hill\": {\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 11,\n        \"The Castro\": 17,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 17,\n        \"Embarcadero\": 9,\n        \"Russian Hill\": 5,\n        \"Alamo Square\": 11,\n        \"North Beach\": 8\n    },\n    \"Alamo Square\": {\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 19,\n        \"The Castro\": 8,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 9,\n        \"Embarcadero\": 17,\n        \"Russian Hill\": 13,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 11,\n        \"North Beach\": 16\n    },\n    \"North Beach\": {\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 5,\n        \"The Castro\": 22,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 22,\n        \"Embarcadero\": 6,\n        \"Russian Hill\": 4,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 7,\n        \"Alamo Square\": 16\n    }\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {'name': 'Joseph', 'location': 'Alamo Square', 'start': 11*60+30, 'end': 12*60+45, 'min_duration': 15},\n    {'name': 'Kimberly', 'location': 'North Beach', 'start': 15*60+45, 'end': 19*60+15, 'min_duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Karen', 'location': 'Russian Hill', 'start': 14*60+30, 'end': 19*60+45, 'min_duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Laura', 'location': 'The Castro', 'start': 19*60+45, 'end': 21*60+30, 'min_duration': 105}\n]\n\ncurrent_location = \"Fisherman's Wharf\"\ncurrent_time = 9 * 60\nitinerary = []\n\nfor friend in friends:\n    travel_duration = travel_times[current_location][friend['location']]\n    arrival_time = current_time + travel_duration\n    start_meeting = max(arrival_time, friend['start'])\n    end_meeting = start_meeting + friend['min_duration']\n    if end_meeting > friend['end']:\n        continue\n    itinerary.append({\n        \"action\": \"meet\",\n        \"location\": friend['location'],\n        \"person\": friend['name'],\n        \"start_time\": minutes_to_time(start_meeting),\n        \"end_time\": minutes_to_time(end_meeting)\n    })\n    current_location = friend['location']\n    current_time = end_meeting\n\nresult = {\"itinerary\": itinerary}\nprint(json.dumps(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `minutes_to_time` function converts minutes past midnight into a formatted time string (e.g., 540 becomes \"9:00\").\n2. **Travel Times**: The `travel_times` dictionary stores the travel duration between every pair of locations.\n3. **Friends' Availability**: The `friends` list contains dictionaries with each friend's name, location, availability window (start and end times in minutes), and minimum meeting duration.\n4. **Scheduling Logic**: \n   - Starting at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM (540 minutes), the algorithm iterates through each friend in the specified order.\n   - For each friend, it calculates the travel time from the current location, adjusts the meeting start time to fit within the friend's availability, and checks if the meeting can be scheduled without exceeding the friend's end time.\n   - If feasible, the meeting is added to the itinerary, and the current location and time are updated.\n5. **Output**: The itinerary is printed as a JSON object containing the sequence of meetings with their respective details.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules meetings while respecting travel constraints and availability windows, maximizing the number of friends met during the day."
