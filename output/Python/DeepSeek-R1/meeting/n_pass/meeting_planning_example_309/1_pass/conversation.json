Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFinancial District to Chinatown: 5.\nFinancial District to Alamo Square: 17.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10.\nChinatown to Financial District: 5.\nChinatown to Alamo Square: 17.\nChinatown to Bayview: 22.\nChinatown to Fisherman's Wharf: 8.\nAlamo Square to Financial District: 17.\nAlamo Square to Chinatown: 16.\nAlamo Square to Bayview: 16.\nAlamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf: 19.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nBayview to Chinatown: 18.\nBayview to Alamo Square: 16.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\nFisherman's Wharf to Financial District: 11.\nFisherman's Wharf to Chinatown: 12.\nFisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square: 20.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Financial District at 9:00AM. Nancy will be at Chinatown from 9:30AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 90 minutes. Mary will be at Alamo Square from 7:00AM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 75 minutes. Jessica will be at Bayview from 11:15AM to 1:45PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 45 minutes. Rebecca will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 7:00AM to 8:30AM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
