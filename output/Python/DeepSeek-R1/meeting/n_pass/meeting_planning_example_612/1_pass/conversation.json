        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find an optimal meeting schedule that allows us to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering their availability windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times between locations. The solution involves generating permutations of meeting sequences, checking feasibility based on constraints, and selecting the first feasible schedule with the maximum number of meetings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling meetings with multiple friends at different locations, each with specific time windows and minimum meeting durations. Travel times between locations are asymmetric and must be accounted for in the schedule.\n2. **Time Conversion**: Convert all time strings (e.g., \"9:00AM\") into minutes past midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n3. **Travel Time Setup**: Create a nested dictionary to store travel times between all pairs of locations.\n4. **Friend Constraints**: Define each friend's constraints, including their location, availability window (start and end times), and minimum meeting duration.\n5. **Permutation Generation**: Iterate over all possible subsets of friends (from largest to smallest size) and their permutations to explore potential meeting sequences.\n6. **Feasibility Check**: For each permutation, simulate the schedule:\n   - Start at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM.\n   - For each friend in the sequence, calculate travel time from the current location.\n   - Determine the earliest possible meeting start time (considering arrival and friend's window).\n   - Ensure the meeting can last the minimum duration within the friend's window.\n7. **Schedule Construction**: If a feasible sequence is found, convert meeting times back to \"H:MM\" format and construct the itinerary in JSON format.\n8. **Output**: Print the first feasible itinerary with the maximum number of meetings. If no feasible schedule is found, output an empty itinerary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef time_str_to_minutes(s):\n    if s.endswith('AM') or

`time_str_to_minutes` function converts time strings (e.g., \"9:00AM\") into minutes past midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Travel Times**: The `travel_time` dictionary stores asymmetric travel times between all pairs of locations.\n3. **Friend Constraints**: The `friends_list` contains dictionaries with each friend's name, location, availability window (converted to minutes), and minimum meeting duration.\n4. **Permutation Check**: The algorithm checks permutations of friends from largest to smallest subsets. For each permutation, it simulates the schedule:\n   - Starts at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM (540 minutes).\n   - For each friend, calculates travel time, checks if the meeting can fit within their window, and updates the current time and location.\n5. **Output**: The first feasible schedule with the maximum number of meetings is converted to the required JSON format and printed. If no feasible schedule is found, an empty itinerary is printed."
