Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible.

Helen will be at Golden Gate Park from 9:30AM to 12:15PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 45 minutes. Steven will be at The Castro from 8:15PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 105 minutes. Deborah will be at Bayview from 8:30AM to 12:00PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 30 minutes. Matthew will be at Marina District from 9:15AM to 2:15PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 45 minutes. Joseph will be at Union Square from 2:15PM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 120 minutes. Ronald will be at Sunset District from 4:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 60 minutes. Robert will be at Alamo Square from 6:30PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 120 minutes. Rebecca will be at Financial District from 2:45PM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 30 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Mission District from 6:30PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
