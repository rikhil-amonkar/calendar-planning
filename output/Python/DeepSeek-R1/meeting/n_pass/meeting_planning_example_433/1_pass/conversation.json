Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNob Hill to Richmond District: 14.\nNob Hill to Financial District: 9.\nNob Hill to North Beach: 8.\nNob Hill to The Castro: 17.\nNob Hill to Golden Gate Park: 17.\nRichmond District to Nob Hill: 17.\nRichmond District to Financial District: 22.\nRichmond District to North Beach: 17.\nRichmond District to The Castro: 16.\nRichmond District to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nFinancial District to Nob Hill: 8.\nFinancial District to Richmond District: 21.\nFinancial District to North Beach: 7.\nFinancial District to The Castro: 23.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nNorth Beach to Nob Hill: 7.\nNorth Beach to Richmond District: 18.\nNorth Beach to Financial District: 8.\nNorth Beach to The Castro: 22.\nNorth Beach to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nThe Castro to Nob Hill: 16.\nThe Castro to Richmond District: 16.\nThe Castro to Financial District: 20.\nThe Castro to North Beach: 20.\nThe Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Nob Hill: 20.\nGolden Gate Park to Richmond District: 7.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nGolden Gate Park to North Beach: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to The Castro: 13.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00AM. Emily will be at Richmond District from 7:00PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 15 minutes. Margaret will be at Financial District from 4:30PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 75 minutes. Ronald will be at North Beach from 6:30PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 45 minutes. Deborah will be at The Castro from 1:45PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:15AM to 2:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
