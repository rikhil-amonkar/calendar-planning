        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to schedule meetings with as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering their availability windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times between locations. The solution involves a depth-first search (DFS) with memoization to explore all possible meeting sequences efficiently, ensuring optimality by maximizing the number of meetings while respecting all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires scheduling meetings with friends at different locations, each with specific availability windows and minimum meeting durations. Travel times between locations must be accounted for, and the schedule must start at Union Square at 9:00 AM.\n2. **Data Representation**: \n   - **Travel Times**: A dictionary of dictionaries stores travel times between all pairs of locations.\n   - **Friends' Constraints**: Each friend's details (name, location, availability start and end times, minimum meeting duration) are stored in a list of dictionaries.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **DFS with Memoization**: We use DFS to explore all possible sequences of meetings. The state in DFS is represented by the current location, a bitmask of visited friends, and the current time. This helps in efficiently pruning redundant states and avoiding recomputation.\n   - **State Handling**: For each state, we try to schedule each unvisited friend by checking if we can travel to their location and meet them within their availability window, considering the minimum duration required.\n4. **Optimization**: \n   - **Memoization**: Caches results of states to avoid redundant computations.\n   - **Early Termination**: Skips friends if their meeting cannot be scheduled within their availability window.\n5. **Output**: The best schedule found is formatted into a JSON object listing each meeting's details in chronological order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    travel_times = {\n        \"Union Square\": {\n            \"Mission District\":

scheduling.\n2. **Friends' Constraints**: Each friend's details, including their name, location, availability window, and minimum meeting duration, are stored in the `friends` list.\n3. **DFS with Memoization**: The `dfs` function recursively explores all possible meeting sequences. The state is defined by the current location, a bitmask representing visited friends, and the current time. For each unvisited friend, the function checks if a meeting can be scheduled within their availability window after accounting for travel time.\n4. **Memoization**: The `memo` dictionary caches results of previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations, significantly improving efficiency.\n5. **Output**: The best schedule found is converted to a JSON object listing each meeting's details (location, person, start and end times) in chronological order and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all feasible meeting sequences while respecting travel and time constraints, ensuring the maximum number of meetings is scheduled."
