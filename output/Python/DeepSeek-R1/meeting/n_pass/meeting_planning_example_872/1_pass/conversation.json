You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 90 minutes. Brian will be at Russian Hill from 3:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 60 minutes. Kenneth will be at North Beach from 9:45AM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 30 minutes. Jason will be at Chinatown from 8:15AM to 11:45AM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 75 minutes. Stephanie will be at Union Square from 2:45PM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 105 minutes. Kimberly will be at Embarcadero from 9:45AM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 75 minutes. Steven will be at Financial District from 7:15AM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 60 minutes. Mark will be at Marina District from 10:15AM to 1:00PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
