Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25.\nFisherman's Wharf to Presidio: 17.\nFisherman's Wharf to Richmond District: 18.\nGolden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to Presidio: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Richmond District: 7.\nPresidio to Fisherman's Wharf: 19.\nPresidio to Golden Gate Park: 12.\nPresidio to Richmond District: 7.\nRichmond District to Fisherman's Wharf: 18.\nRichmond District to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nRichmond District to Presidio: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00AM. Melissa will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:30AM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 15 minutes. Nancy will be at Presidio from 7:45PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 105 minutes. Emily will be at Richmond District from 4:45PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
