Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFinancial District to Russian Hill: 10.\nFinancial District to Sunset District: 31.\nFinancial District to North Beach: 7.\nFinancial District to The Castro: 23.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nRussian Hill to Financial District: 11.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to North Beach: 5.\nRussian Hill to The Castro: 21.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\nSunset District to Financial District: 30.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to North Beach: 29.\nSunset District to The Castro: 17.\nSunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nNorth Beach to Financial District: 8.\nNorth Beach to Russian Hill: 4.\nNorth Beach to Sunset District: 27.\nNorth Beach to The Castro: 22.\nNorth Beach to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nThe Castro to Financial District: 20.\nThe Castro to Russian Hill: 18.\nThe Castro to Sunset District: 17.\nThe Castro to North Beach: 20.\nThe Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nGolden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to North Beach: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to The Castro: 13.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Financial District at 9:00AM.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to schedule meetings with as many friends as possible while respecting their availability constraints and accounting for travel times between different locations. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings by efficiently organizing the schedule around fixed and flexible time slots.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling meetings with friends at different locations in San Francisco. Each friend has specific time windows during which they are available, and each meeting requires a minimum duration. The solution must account for travel times between locations and start from the Financial District at 9:00 AM.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The meeting with Laura is fixed at 12:30 PM to 12:45 PM at North Beach. This divides the day into two parts: before 12:30 PM and after 12:45 PM. The challenge is to schedule meetings in these intervals while respecting travel times and availability constraints.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Morning Scenario**: Schedule Patricia in the morning (if feasible) before Laura's meeting.\n   - **Afternoon Scenario**: Schedule the remaining meetings (Patricia if not scheduled in the morning, Ronald, Emily, and Mary) after Laura's meeting.\n   - **Permutation Check**: For the afternoon meetings, generate all permutations of the remaining friends and check for feasible schedules that respect travel times and availability windows.\n\n4. **Optimization**: \n   - **Maximize Meetings**: Prioritize scheduling as many meetings as possible.\n   - **Early Finish**: Among schedules with the same number of meetings, choose the one that finishes earliest.\n\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves checking permutations of up to 4 friends for the afternoon schedule, resulting in 4! = 24 permutations. This is computationally feasible given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes_since_900):\n    total_minutes = minutes_since_900\n    hours = 9 + total_minutes // 60\n    minutes = total_minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\ndef main():\n    travel_times = {\n        \"Financial District\": {\"Russian Hill\": 10, \"Sunset District\": 31, \"North Beach\": 7, \"The Castro\": 23, \"Golden Gate Park\": 23},\n        \"Russian Hill\": {\"Financial District\": 11, \"Sunset District\": 23, \"North Beach\": 5, \"The Castro\": 21, \"Golden Gate Park\": 21},\n        \"Sunset District\": {\"Financial District\": 30, \"Russian Hill\": 24, \"North Beach\": 29, \"The Castro\": 17, \"Golden Gate Park\": 11},\n        \"North Beach\": {\"Financial District\": 8, \"Russian Hill\": 4, \"Sunset District\": 27, \"The Castro\": 22, \"Golden Gate Park\": 22},\n        \"The Castro\": {\"Financial District\": 20, \"Russian Hill\": 18, \"Sunset District\": 17, \"North Beach\": 20, \"Golden Gate Park\": 11},\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": {\"Financial District\": 26, \"Russian Hill\": 19, \"Sunset District\": 10, \"North Beach\": 24, \"The Castro\": 13}\n    }\n    \n    meetings = {\n        \"Patricia\": (\"Sunset District\", 15, 780, 60),\n        \"Ronald\": (\"Russian Hill\", 285, 495, 105),\n        \"Emily\": (\"The Castro\", 435, 570, 60),\n        \"Mary\": (\"Golden Gate Park\", 360, 450, 60)\n    }\n    laura_meeting = (\"Laura\", \"North Beach\", 210, 225, 15)\n    \n    scenarios = []\n    \n    #

If feasible, it checks travel times to ensure arrival at North Beach by 12:30 PM.\n   - **Afternoon Scenario**: Schedules the remaining friends after Laura's meeting. It generates all permutations of the remaining friends to find a feasible schedule that respects travel times and availability.\n4. **Optimal Schedule Selection**: The solution evaluates both scenarios, selecting the one that maximizes the number of meetings. If tied, the schedule finishing earliest is chosen.\n5. **Output**: The optimal schedule is formatted as a JSON object listing each meeting's location, person, start, and end times.\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the constraints to maximize the number of meetings while accounting for travel times and availability windows."
