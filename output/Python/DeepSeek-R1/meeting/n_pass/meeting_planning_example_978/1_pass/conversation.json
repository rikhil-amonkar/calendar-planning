Stephanie will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 3:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 30 minutes. Lisa will be at Financial District from 10:45AM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Lisa for a minimum of 15 minutes. Melissa will be at Russian Hill from 5:00PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 120 minutes. Betty will be at Marina District from 10:45AM to 2:15PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 60 minutes. Sarah will be at Richmond District from 4:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 105 minutes. Daniel will be at Pacific Heights from 6:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 60 minutes. Joshua will be at Haight-Ashbury from 9:00AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 15 minutes. Joseph will be at Presidio from 7:00AM to 1:00PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 45 minutes. Andrew will be at Nob Hill from 7:45PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Andrew for a minimum of 105 minutes. John will be at The Castro from 1:15PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet John for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
