Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nPacific Heights to Presidio: 11.\nPacific Heights to Marina District: 6.\nPresidio to Pacific Heights: 11.\nPresidio to Marina District: 10.\nMarina District to Pacific Heights: 7.\nMarina District to Presidio: 10.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Pacific Heights at 9:00AM.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to schedule meetings with friends in different locations while accounting for travel times and availability constraints. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings, which in this case means meeting both friends if possible. The solution involves determining the optimal start times for each meeting to ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We start at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM.\n   - Jason is available at Presidio from 10:00 AM to 4:15 PM, requiring a 90-minute meeting.\n   - Kenneth is available at Marina District from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM, requiring a 45-minute meeting.\n   - Travel times between locations are provided in minutes.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - The only feasible order of meetings is Jason first, then Kenneth, as the reverse order is not possible due to time constraints.\n   - We need to compute the optimal start time for Jason's meeting such that we can travel to Kenneth's location and meet him within his availability window.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Feasibility Check**: Determine the earliest and latest possible start times for Jason's meeting considering his availability and the need to travel to Kenneth's location afterward.\n   - **Optimization**: Minimize the maximum waiting time at either Pacific Heights or Marina District by selecting a start time for Jason's meeting that balances the waiting periods.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    base = 9 * 60  # 9:00 AM in minutes from midnight (540 minutes)\n    \n    travel_times = {\n        ('PacificHeights', 'Presidio'): 11,\n        ('PacificHeights', 'Marina'): 6,\n        ('Presidio', 'PacificHeights'): 11,\n        ('Presidio', 'Marina'): 10,\n        ('Marina', 'PacificHeights'): 7,\n        ('Marina', 'Presidio'): 10\n    }\n    \n    constraints = {\n        'Jason': (10 * 60, 16 * 60 + 15),    # 10:00 to 16:15 (600 to 975 minutes)\n        'Kenneth': (15 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60 + 45)  # 15:30 to 16:45 (930 to 1005 minutes)\n    }\n    \n    durations = {\n        'Jason': 90,\n        'Kenneth': 45\n    }\n    \n    locations = {\n        'Jason': 'Presidio',\n        'Kenneth': 'Marina'\n    }\n    \n    current_location = 'PacificHeights'\n    current_time = base\n    \n    # Calculate feasible start time range for Jason\n    travel_to_jason = travel_times[(current_location, locations['Jason'])]\n    jason_start_min = max(current_time + travel_to_jason, constraints['Jason'][0])\n    jason_start_max = min(\n        constraints['Jason'][1] -

Travel times, meeting constraints, durations, and locations are defined.\n2. **Feasibility Check**: The earliest and latest start times for Jason's meeting are calculated considering his availability and the travel time to Kenneth's location.\n3. **Optimization**: Two candidate start times (11:30 AM and 11:31 AM) are evaluated to minimize the maximum waiting time at either Pacific Heights or Marina District.\n4. **Scheduling**: The optimal start time for Jason's meeting is selected, and the meeting with Kenneth is scheduled immediately after accounting for travel time.\n5. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON object with meeting details, including start and end times in 24-hour format without leading zeros for hours.\n\nThis approach ensures that both meetings are scheduled within the given constraints while minimizing waiting times, providing an optimal solution for meeting as many friends as possible."
