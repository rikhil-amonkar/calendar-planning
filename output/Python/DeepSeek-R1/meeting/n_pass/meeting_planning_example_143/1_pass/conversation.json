Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNorth Beach to Pacific Heights: 8.\nNorth Beach to Embarcadero: 6.\nPacific Heights to North Beach: 9.\nPacific Heights to Embarcadero: 10.\nEmbarcadero to North Beach: 5.\nEmbarcadero to Pacific Heights: 11.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at North Beach at 9:00AM. Karen will be at Pacific Heights from 6:45PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 90 minutes. Mark will be at Embarcadero from 1:00PM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to schedule meetings with friends in San Francisco while accounting for travel times and meeting constraints. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible by optimizing the schedule based on their availability and travel durations between locations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: All time inputs are converted into minutes past midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Define Travel Times**: A dictionary of dictionaries is used to store travel times between different locations.\n3. **Meeting Constraints**: Define the start time, location, and meeting durations for each friend.\n4. **Schedule Calculation**:\n   - **First Meeting (Mark)**: Calculate the latest possible start time for Mark's meeting at Embarcadero, ensuring the meeting fits within his availability window (1:00 PM to 5:45 PM) and accounts for travel from the starting location (North Beach at 9:00 AM). The meeting duration is 120 minutes.\n   - **Travel to Next Meeting**: After meeting Mark, travel to Pacific Heights for Karen's meeting. The travel time is 11 minutes.\n   - **Second Meeting (Karen)**: Schedule Karen's meeting to start as soon as possible after arrival, within her availability window (6:45 PM to 8:15 PM). The meeting duration is 90 minutes.\n5. **Output**: Format the meeting schedule as a JSON object with start and end times in 24-hour format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    parts = time_str.split(':')\n    hour = int(parts[0])\n    minutes = int(parts[1])\n    return hour * 60 + minutes\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes_val):\n    hour = minutes_val // 60\n    minute = minutes_val % 60\n    return f\"{hour}:{minute:02d}\"\n\ndef main():\n    travel_times = {\n        \"North Beach\": {\n            \"Pacific Heights\": 8,\n            \"Embarcadero\": 6\n        },\n        \"Pacific Heights\": {\n            \"North Beach\": 9,\n            \"Embarcadero\": 10\n        },\n        \"Embarcadero\": {\n            \"North Beach\": 5,\n            \"Pacific Heights\": 11\n        }\n    }\n    \n    start_location = \"North Beach\"\n    start_time_str = \"9:00\"\n    start_time = time_to_minutes(start_time_str)\n    \n    mark_location = \"Embarcadero\"\n    mark_available_start_str = \"13:00\"\n    mark_available_end_str = \"17:45\"\n    mark_min_duration = 120\n    \n    karen_location = \"Pacific Heights\"\n    karen_available_start_str = \"18:45\"\n    karen_available_end_str = \"20:15\"\n    karen_min_duration = 90\n    \n    mark_start = time_to_minutes(mark_available_start_str)\n    mark_end = time_to_minutes(mark_available_end_str)\n    karen_start = time_to_minutes(karen_available_start_str)\n    karen_end = time_to_minutes(karen_available_end_str)\n    \n    travel_to_mark = travel_times[start_location][mark_location]\n    earliest_arrival_at_mark = start_time + travel_to_mark\n    \n    mark_meeting_start = min(mark_end - mark_min_duration, max(earliest_arrival_at_mark, mark_start))\n    mark_meeting_end = mark_meeting_start + mark_min_duration\n    \n    travel_to_karen = travel_times[mark_location][karen_location]\n    arrival_at_karen = mark_meeting_end + travel_to_karen\n    \n    karen_meeting_start = max(arrival_at_karen, karen_start)\n    if karen_meeting_start + karen_min_duration > karen_end:\n        karen_meeting_start = None\n    else:\n        karen_meeting_end = karen_meeting_start + karen_min_duration\n    \n    itinerary = []\n    if mark_meeting_start is not None:\n        itinerary.append({\n            \"action\": \"meet\",\n            \"location\": mark_location,\n            \"person\": \"Mark\",\n            \"start_time\": minutes_to_time(mark_meeting_start),\n            \"end_time\": minutes_to_time(mark_meeting_end)\n        })\n    \n    if karen_meeting_start is not None:\n        itinerary.append({\n            \"action\": \"meet\",\n            \"location\": karen_location,\n            \"person\": \"Karen\",\n            \"start_time\": minutes_to_time(karen_meeting_start),\n            \"end_time\": minutes_to_time(karen_meeting_end)\n        })\n    \n    result = {\n        \"itinerary\": itinerary\n    }\n    \n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `time_to_minutes` function converts time strings (e.g., \"9:00\") into minutes past midnight, and `minutes_to_time` converts minutes back to time strings.\n2. **Travel Times**: The `travel_times` dictionary stores the travel durations between locations, accounting for asymmetric travel times.\n3. **Meeting Constraints**: Mark's meeting is scheduled first at Embarcadero. The latest possible start time is calculated to fit his 120-minute meeting within his availability window (1:00 PM to 5:45 PM), considering travel from North Beach.\n4. **Travel to Next Meeting**: After meeting Mark, travel time to Pacific Heights is 11 minutes. Karen's meeting is scheduled to start as soon as possible after arrival, within her window (6:45 PM to 8:15 PM), lasting 90 minutes.\n5. **Output**: The meeting schedule is formatted as a JSON object with start and end times in 24-hour format, ensuring all constraints are met. The program outputs the optimal itinerary meeting both friends."
