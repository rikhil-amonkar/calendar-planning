Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to The Castro: 17.\nSunset District to Richmond District: 12.\nSunset District to Marina District: 21.\nSunset District to North Beach: 29.\nSunset District to Union Square: 30.\nSunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to The Castro: 21.\nRussian Hill to Richmond District: 14.\nRussian Hill to Marina District: 7.\nRussian Hill to North Beach: 5.\nRussian Hill to Union Square: 11.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\nThe Castro to Sunset District: 17.\nThe Castro to Russian Hill: 18.\nThe Castro to Richmond District: 16.\nThe Castro to Marina District: 21.\nThe Castro to North Beach: 20.\nThe Castro to Union Square: 19.\nThe Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nRichmond District to Sunset District: 11.\nRichmond District to Russian Hill: 13.\nRichmond District to The Castro: 16.\nRichmond District to Marina District: 9.\nRichmond District to North Beach: 17.\nRichmond District to Union Square: 21.\nRichmond District to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nMarina District to Sunset District: 19.\nMarina District to Russian Hill: 8.\nMarina District to The Castro: 22.\nMarina District to Richmond District: 11.\nMarina District to North Beach: 11.\nMarina District to Union Square: 16.\nMarina District to Golden Gate Park: 18.\nNorth Beach to Sunset District: 27.\nNorth Beach to Russian Hill: 4.\nNorth Beach to The Castro: 22.\nNorth Beach to Richmond District: 18.\nNorth Beach to Marina District: 9.\nNorth Beach to Union Square: 7.\nNorth Beach to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nUnion Square to Sunset District: 26.\nUnion Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nUnion Square to The Castro: 19.\nUnion Square to Richmond District: 20.\nUnion Square to Marina District: 18.\nUnion Square to North Beach: 10.\nUnion Square to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nGolden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nGolden Gate Park to The Castro: 13.\nGolden Gate Park to Richmond District: 7.\nGolden Gate Park to Marina District: 16.\nGolden Gate Park to North Beach: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to Union Square: 22.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM. Karen will be at Russian Hill from 8:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 60 minutes. Jessica will be at The Castro from 3:45PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 60 minutes. Matthew will be at Richmond District from 7:30AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 15 minutes. Michelle will be at Marina District from 10:30AM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Michelle for a minimum of 75 minutes. Carol will be at North Beach from 12:00PM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 90 minutes. Stephanie will be at Union Square from 10:45AM to 2:15PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 30 minutes. Linda will be at Golden Gate Park from 10:45AM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Linda for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
