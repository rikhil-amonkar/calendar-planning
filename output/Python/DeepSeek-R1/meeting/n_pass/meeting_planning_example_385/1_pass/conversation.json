Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNob Hill to Presidio: 17.\nNob Hill to North Beach: 8.\nNob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf: 11.\nNob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8.\nPresidio to Nob Hill: 18.\nPresidio to North Beach: 18.\nPresidio to Fisherman's Wharf: 19.\nPresidio to Pacific Heights: 11.\nNorth Beach to Nob Hill: 7.\nNorth Beach to Presidio: 17.\nNorth Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: 5.\nNorth Beach to Pacific Heights: 8.\nFisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill: 11.\nFisherman's Wharf to Presidio: 17.\nFisherman's Wharf to North Beach: 6.\nFisherman's Wharf to Pacific Heights: 12.\nPacific Heights to Nob Hill: 8.\nPacific Heights to Presidio: 11.\nPacific Heights to North Beach: 9.\nPacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf: 13.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00AM. Jeffrey will be at Presidio from 8:00AM to 10:00AM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 105 minutes. Steven will be at North Beach from 1:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 45 minutes. Barbara will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 6:00PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 30 minutes. John will be at Pacific Heights from 9:00AM to 1:30PM.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to schedule meetings with friends in San Francisco while adhering to their availability constraints and accounting for travel times between locations. The goal is to maximize the number of friends met and minimize waiting time between meetings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling meetings with friends at different locations, considering their availability and travel times between locations. The solution must maximize the number of friends met while respecting their time constraints and travel durations.\n2. **Intuition**: We need to explore all possible permutations of meeting sequences to determine the optimal schedule that allows meeting the most friends. For each permutation, we simulate the schedule, checking feasibility based on travel times and availability.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Permutations**: Generate all possible sequences of friends to explore every potential meeting order.\n   - **Simulation**: For each permutation, simulate the schedule:\n     - Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n     - For each friend in the sequence, calculate travel time from the current location.\n     - Determine the earliest possible departure time to arrive at the friend's location by their start time.\n     - Check if the meeting duration fits within the friend's availability window.\n     - Track successful meetings and accumulate waiting times.\n   - **Optimization**: Select the permutation with the highest number of meetings. If multiple permutations yield the same number, choose the one with the least total waiting time.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: With 4 friends, there are 24 permutations. Each permutation involves a linear pass through the sequence, making the overall complexity O(4! * 4) = O(96), which is efficient for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    parts = time_str.split(':')\n    hours = int(parts[0])\n    minutes = int(parts[1]) if len(parts) > 1 else 0\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes_val):\n    hours = minutes_val // 60\n    minutes = minutes_val % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\ntravel_times = {\n    \"Nob Hill\": {\n        \"Nob Hill\": 0,\n        \"Presidio\": 17,\n        \"North Beach\": 8,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 11,\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 8\n    },\n    \"Presidio\": {\n        \"Nob Hill\": 18,\n        \"Presidio\": 0,\n        \"North Beach\": 18,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 19,\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 11\n    },\n    \"North Beach\": {\n        \"Nob Hill\": 7,\n        \"Presidio\": 17,\n        \"North Beach\": 0,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 5,\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 8\n    },\n    \"Fisherman's Wharf\": {\n        \"Nob Hill\": 11,\n        \"Presidio\": 17,\n        \"North Beach\": 6,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 0,\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 12\n    },\n    \"Pacific Heights\": {\n        \"Nob Hill\": 8,\n        \"Presidio\": 11,\n        \"North Beach\": 9,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 13,\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 0\n    }\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Jeffrey',\n        'location': 'Presidio',\n        'start_str': '8:00',\n        'end_str': '10:00',\n        'min_duration': 105\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'John',\n        'location': 'Pacific Heights',\n        'start_str': '9:00',\n        'end_str': '13:30',\n        'min_duration': 15\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Steven',\n        'location': 'North Beach',\n        'start_str': '13:30',\n        'end_str': '22:00',\n        'min_duration': 45\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Barbara',\n        'location': \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n        'start_str': '18:00',\n        'end_str': '21:30',\n        'min_duration': 30\n    }\n]\n\nfor friend in friends:\n    friend['start_min'] = time_to_minutes(friend['start_str'])\n    friend['end_min'] = time_to_minutes(friend['end_str'])\n\nstart_time_minutes = 540\nstart_location = 'Nob Hill'\n\nbest_itinerary = None\nbest_count = 0\nbest_waiting = float('inf')\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_time = start_time_minutes\n    current_location = start_location\n    itinerary_perm = []\n    count = 0\n    total_waiting = 0\n    for friend in perm:\n        if current_location == friend['location']:\n            travel_time = 0\n        else:\n            travel_time = travel_times[current_location][friend['location']]\n        \n        leave_time = max(current_time, friend['start_min'] - travel_time)\n        wait_time_here = leave_time - current_time\n        total_waiting += wait_time_here\n        \n        arrival_time = leave_time + travel_time\n        meeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend['start_min'])\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['min_duration']\n        \n        if meeting_end <= friend['end_min']:\n            itinerary_perm.append({\n                'action': 'meet',\n                'location': friend['location'],\n                'person': friend['name'],\n                'start_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_start),\n                'end_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n            })\n            count += 1\n            current_time = meeting_end\n            current_location = friend['location']\n        else:\n            total_waiting -= wait_time_here\n    \n    if count > best_count or (count == best_count and total_waiting < best_waiting):\n        best_count = count\n        best_itinerary = itinerary_perm\n        best_waiting = total_waiting\n\nresult = {\n    \"itinerary\": best_itinerary\n}\n\nprint(json.dumps(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `time_to_minutes` function converts time strings (e.g., \"9:00\") to minutes since midnight for easier arithmetic. The `minutes_to_time` function reverses this process.\n2. **Travel Times**: A nested dictionary stores travel times between all pairs of locations, including zero for staying at the same location.\n3. **Friend Data**: Each friend's data includes their name, location, availability window, and minimum meeting duration, converted to minutes for processing.\n4. **Permutation Simulation**: For each permutation of friends:\n   - Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM (540 minutes).\n   - For each friend, calculate travel time and the earliest departure time to arrive by their start time.\n   - If the meeting fits within their availability, add it to the itinerary; otherwise, skip.\n   - Track the number of meetings and total waiting time.\n5. **Optimal Selection**: After evaluating all permutations, select the one with the most meetings. If tied, choose the schedule with the least waiting time.\n6. **Output**: The best itinerary is printed as a JSON object, listing each meeting's location, person, start, and end times.\n\nThis approach ensures the optimal schedule is found by exhaustively checking all possible meeting sequences while respecting constraints and minimizing waiting time."
