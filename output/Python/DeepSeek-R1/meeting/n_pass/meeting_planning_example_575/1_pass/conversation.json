Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nThe Castro to Presidio: 20.\nThe Castro to Sunset District: 17.\nThe Castro to Haight-Ashbury: 6.\nThe Castro to Mission District: 7.\nThe Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nThe Castro to Russian Hill: 18.\nPresidio to The Castro: 21.\nPresidio to Sunset District: 15.\nPresidio to Haight-Ashbury: 15.\nPresidio to Mission District: 26.\nPresidio to Golden Gate Park: 12.\nPresidio to Russian Hill: 14.\nSunset District to The Castro: 17.\nSunset District to Presidio: 16.\nSunset District to Haight-Ashbury: 15.\nSunset District to Mission District: 24.\nSunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nHaight-Ashbury to The Castro: 6.\nHaight-Ashbury to Presidio: 15.\nHaight-Ashbury to Sunset District: 15.\nHaight-Ashbury to Mission District: 11.\nHaight-Ashbury to Golden Gate Park: 7.\nHaight-Ashbury to Russian Hill: 17.\nMission District to The Castro: 7.\nMission District to Presidio: 25.\nMission District to Sunset District: 24.\nMission District to Haight-Ashbury: 12.\nMission District to Golden Gate Park: 17.\nMission District to Russian Hill: 15.\nGolden Gate Park to The Castro: 13.\nGolden Gate Park to Presidio: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Haight-Ashbury: 7.\nGolden Gate Park to Mission District: 17.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nRussian Hill to The Castro: 21.\nRussian Hill to Presidio: 14.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to Haight-Ashbury: 17.\nRussian Hill to Mission District: 16.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at The Castro at 9:00AM. Rebecca will be at Presidio from 6:15PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 60 minutes. Linda will be at Sunset District from 3:30PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Linda for a minimum of 30 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Haight-Ashbury from 5:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 105 minutes. William will be at Mission District from 1:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 30 minutes. Robert will be at Golden Gate Park from 2:15PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 45 minutes. Mark will be at Russian Hill from 10:00AM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
