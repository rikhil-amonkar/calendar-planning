        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create an optimal meeting schedule that allows a visitor to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and each friend's availability constraints. The solution involves calculating the best sequence of meetings by considering travel times between locations and ensuring each meeting fits within the friend's available time window while meeting the minimum duration requirement.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires scheduling meetings with multiple friends across different locations in San Francisco. Each friend has specific time windows during which they are available, and each meeting requires a minimum duration. Travel times between locations are provided and must be accounted for in the schedule.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal schedule can be derived by processing meetings in a specific order that minimizes waiting times and ensures all constraints are met. The order is determined by prioritizing friends with tighter time windows or earlier availability.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: A greedy algorithm is used where meetings are scheduled in a predefined order. For each meeting, the algorithm calculates the arrival time based on the previous meeting's end time and travel time. The meeting starts at the later of the arrival time or the friend's available start time. The meeting must end before the friend's available end time.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each meeting once, making it linear in time complexity, O(N), where N is the number of meetings. The travel time lookup is O(1) due to the precomputed travel matrix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef minutes_to_time(total_minutes):\n    hours = total_minutes // 60\n    minutes =

all pairs of locations, ensuring quick lookup during scheduling.\n2. **Meeting Order**: The `meetings_in_order` list specifies the sequence of meetings. Each entry includes the friend's name, location, available start and end times (in minutes), and minimum meeting duration.\n3. **Scheduling Algorithm**: The algorithm starts at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM (540 minutes). For each meeting, it calculates the arrival time by adding the travel time from the previous location. The meeting starts at the later of the arrival time or the friend's available start time. The meeting must end before the friend's available end time.\n4. **Output**: The scheduled meetings are stored in the `itinerary` list and printed as a JSON object, showing each meeting's location, person, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules meetings by considering travel times and availability constraints, ensuring the visitor meets as many friends as possible within the given time frame."
