Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nBayview to Embarcadero: 19.\nBayview to Richmond District: 25.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\nEmbarcadero to Bayview: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Richmond District: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf: 6.\nRichmond District to Bayview: 26.\nRichmond District to Embarcadero: 19.\nRichmond District to Fisherman's Wharf: 18.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero: 8.\nFisherman's Wharf to Richmond District: 18.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to schedule meetings with friends in different locations of San Francisco while considering travel times and the availability windows of each friend. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings attended, adhering to the constraints provided.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling meetings with three friends (Jessica, Sandra, and Jason) at different locations (Embarcadero, Richmond District, and Fisherman's Wharf). Each friend has a specific availability window and a minimum meeting duration. The solution must account for travel times between locations and the starting point (Bayview at 9:00 AM).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal schedule must maximize the number of meetings by efficiently sequencing the meetings and considering travel times. The solution involves:\n   - **Travel Time Matrix**: A dictionary that stores travel times between all pairs of locations.\n   - **Meeting Constraints**: Each friend's availability window and minimum meeting duration.\n   - **Permutations and Masks**: Generating all possible sequences of meetings (permutations) and subsets of meetings (masks) to explore feasible schedules.\n   - **Simulation**: For each permutation and mask, simulate the schedule to check if all selected meetings can be attended without violating constraints.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Permutations**: Generate all possible orders of meetings.\n   - **Masks**: Represent subsets of meetings to consider (e.g., attending all three, or any two).\n   - **Simulation**: For each permutation and mask, simulate travel and meeting times to validate the schedule. Track the best valid schedule (maximizing the number of meetings).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: With only three meetings, the number of permutations (6) and masks (7) is manageable (42 combinations), making the approach feasible without optimization concerns.\n\n5. **Output**: The best valid schedule is formatted as a JSON object containing the itinerary with meeting details (location, person, start and end times).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef format_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\ndef main():\n    travel_times = {\n        \"Bayview\": {\n            \"Embarcadero\": 19,\n            \"Richmond District\": 25,\n            \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 25\n        },\n        \"Embarcadero\": {\n            \"Bayview\": 21,\n            \"Richmond District\": 21,\n            \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 6\n        },\n        \"Richmond District\": {\n            \"Bayview\": 26,\n            \"Embarcadero\": 19,\n            \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 18\n        },\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": {\n            \"Bayview\": 26,\n            \"Embarcadero\": 8,\n            \"Richmond District\": 18\n        }\n    }\n    \n    meetings_list = [\n        {\"name\": \"Jessica\", \"location\": \"Embarcadero\", \"start_avail\": 16*60+45, \"end_avail\": 19*60, \"min_duration\": 30},\n        {\"name\": \"Sandra\", \"location\": \"Richmond District\", \"start_avail\": 18*60+30, \"end_avail\": 21*60+45, \"min_duration\": 120},\n        {\"name\": \"Jason\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"start_avail\": 16*60, \"end_avail\": 16*60+45, \"min_duration\": 30}\n    ]\n    \n    masks = list(itertools.product([0,1], repeat=3))\n    masks = [m for m in masks if sum(m) > 0]\n    masks_sorted = sorted(masks, key=lambda x: sum(x), reverse=True)\n    \n    best_count = 0\n    best_itinerary = None\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(meetings_list):\n        for mask in masks_sorted:\n            current_time = 540\n            current_location = 'Bayview'\n            itinerary = []\n            valid = True\n            for i in range(3):\n                if mask[i] == 1:\n                    meeting = perm[i]\n                    travel_duration = travel_times[current_location][meeting['location']]\n                    arrival = current_time + travel_duration\n                    start_meeting = max(meeting['start_avail'], arrival)\n                    if start_meeting + meeting['min_duration'] <= meeting['end_avail']:\n                        end_meeting = start_meeting + meeting['min_duration']\n                        itinerary.append({\n                            'meeting': meeting,\n                            'start': start_meeting,\n                            'end': end_meeting\n                        })\n                        current_time = end_meeting\n                        current_location = meeting['location']\n                    else:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            if valid:\n                count = len(itinerary)\n                if count > best_count:\n                    best_count = count\n                    best_itinerary = itinerary\n                    if best_count == 3:\n                        break\n            if best_count == 3:\n                break\n        if best_count == 3:\n            break\n    \n    if best_itinerary is None:\n        output_itinerary = []\n    else:\n        output_itinerary = []\n        for item in best_itinerary:\n            meeting = item['meeting']\n            output_itinerary.append({\n                \"action\": \"meet\",\n                \"location\": meeting['location'],\n                \"person\": meeting['name'],\n                \"start_time\": format_time(item['start']),\n                \"end_time\": format_time(item['end'])\n            })\n    \n    result = {\n        \"itinerary\": output_itinerary\n    }\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Travel Time Matrix**: The `travel_times` dictionary stores the time (in minutes) required to travel between any two locations.\n2. **Meeting Constraints**: Each meeting is defined by a dictionary specifying the friend's name, location, availability window (start and end times in minutes), and minimum meeting duration.\n3. **Permutations and Masks**: The algorithm generates all possible sequences of meetings (permutations) and subsets of meetings (masks) to explore feasible schedules.\n4. **Simulation**: For each permutation and mask, the algorithm simulates the schedule:\n   - **Travel Calculation**: Computes travel time from the current location to the next meeting location.\n   - **Meeting Scheduling**: Determines the earliest possible start time within the friend's availability window and checks if the meeting can fit within the window.\n5. **Output**: The best valid schedule (maximizing the number of meetings) is formatted as a JSON object, listing each meeting's details (location, person, start, and end times in 24-hour format).\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible schedules, ensuring the optimal solution is found while adhering to all constraints."
