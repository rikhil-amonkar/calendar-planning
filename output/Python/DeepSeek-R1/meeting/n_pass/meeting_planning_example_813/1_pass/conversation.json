Joshua will be at Embarcadero from 9:45AM to 6:00PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 105 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Bayview from 9:45AM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 75 minutes. Charles will be at Union Square from 10:45AM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 120 minutes. Joseph will be at Chinatown from 7:00AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 60 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Sunset District from 9:00AM to 9:45AM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 45 minutes. Matthew will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:00AM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 45 minutes. Carol will be at Financial District from 10:45AM to 11:15AM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 15 minutes. Paul will be at Haight-Ashbury from 7:15PM to 8:30PM. You'd like to meet Paul for a minimum of 15 minutes. Rebecca will be at Mission District from 5:00PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
