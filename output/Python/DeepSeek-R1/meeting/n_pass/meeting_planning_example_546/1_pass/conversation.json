Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nEmbarcadero to Richmond District: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Union Square: 10.\nEmbarcadero to Financial District: 5.\nEmbarcadero to Pacific Heights: 11.\nEmbarcadero to Nob Hill: 10.\nEmbarcadero to Bayview: 21.\nRichmond District to Embarcadero: 19.\nRichmond District to Union Square: 21.\nRichmond District to Financial District: 22.\nRichmond District to Pacific Heights: 10.\nRichmond District to Nob Hill: 17.\nRichmond District to Bayview: 26.\nUnion Square to Embarcadero: 11.\nUnion Square to Richmond District: 20.\nUnion Square to Financial District: 9.\nUnion Square to Pacific Heights: 15.\nUnion Square to Nob Hill: 9.\nUnion Square to Bayview: 15.\nFinancial District to Embarcadero: 4.\nFinancial District to Richmond District: 21.\nFinancial District to Union Square: 9.\nFinancial District to Pacific Heights: 13.\nFinancial District to Nob Hill: 8.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nPacific Heights to Embarcadero: 10.\nPacific Heights to Richmond District: 12.\nPacific Heights to Union Square: 12.\nPacific Heights to Financial District: 13.\nPacific Heights to Nob Hill: 8.\nPacific Heights to Bayview: 22.\nNob Hill to Embarcadero: 9.\nNob Hill to Richmond District: 14.\nNob Hill to Union Square: 7.\nNob Hill to Financial District: 9.\nNob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8.\nNob Hill to Bayview: 19.\nBayview to Embarcadero: 19.\nBayview to Richmond District: 25.\nBayview to Union Square: 17.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nBayview to Pacific Heights: 23.\nBayview to Nob Hill: 20.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Embarcadero at 9:00AM. Kenneth will be at Richmond District from 9:15PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 30 minutes. Lisa will be at Union Square from 9:00AM to 4:30PM. You'd like to meet Lisa for a minimum of 45 minutes. Joshua will be at Financial District from 12:00PM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 15 minutes. Nancy will be at Pacific Heights from 8:00AM to 11:30AM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 90 minutes. Andrew will be at Nob Hill from 11:30AM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Andrew for a minimum of 60 minutes. John will be at Bayview from 4:45PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet John for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
