        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to schedule meetings with friends in San Francisco while accounting for travel times between locations and the availability constraints of each friend. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, adhering to their time windows and minimum meeting duration requirements, starting from North Beach at 9:00 AM.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling meetings with multiple friends at different locations, considering travel times between locations and the time windows during which each friend is available. The challenge is to find an optimal schedule that maximizes the number of meetings while respecting all constraints.\n\n2. **Key Insights**: \n   - **Travel Times**: The travel times between locations are asymmetric (e.g., traveling from A to B may take a different time than from B to A).\n   - **Time Windows**: Each friend has a specific time window during which they are available, and the meeting must last at least a specified minimum duration within this window.\n   - **Start and End Points**: The day starts at North Beach at 9:00 AM and must include meeting James at Pacific Heights from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM for 120 minutes.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Permutation Generation**: Given the small number of meetings (6), we generate all possible permutations of the meetings to explore every possible order.\n   - **Simulation for Valid Schedules**: For each permutation, simulate the schedule by:\n     - Starting at North Beach at 9:00 AM.\n     - Traveling to each meeting location in sequence, updating the current time with travel duration.\n     - Scheduling each meeting to start as soon as possible after arrival, within the friend's availability window.\n     - Checking if the meeting can be completed within the friend's time window.\n   - **Optimal Schedule Selection**: Track the schedule that maximizes the number of meetings. If multiple schedules meet the same number of friends, select the one with the least total travel time.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: Generating all permutations of 6 meetings results in 6! (720) permutations. For each permutation, the simulation processes each meeting once, leading to an overall complexity of O(6! * 6), which is feasible for the problem size.\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space required is O(1) for storing the best schedule and O(6!) for generating permutations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    parts = time_str.split(':')\n    hours = int(parts[0])\n    minutes = int(parts[1])\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n\ndef minutes_to_time(mins):\n    hours = mins // 60\n    minutes = mins % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\ntravel_times = {\n    \"North Beach\": {\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 8,\n        \"Chinatown\": 6,\n        \"Union Square\": 7,\n        \"Mission District\": 18,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 22,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 7\n    },\n    \"Pacific Heights\": {\n        \"North Beach\": 9,\n        \"Chinatown\": 11,\n        \"Union Square\": 12,\n        \"Mission District\": 15,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 15,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 8\n    },\n    \"Chinatown\": {\n        \"North Beach\": 3,\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 10,\n        \"Union Square\": 7,\n        \"Mission District\": 18,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 23,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 8\n    },\n    \"Union Square\": {\n        \"North Beach\": 10,\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 15,\n        \"Chinatown\": 7,\n        \"Mission District\": 14,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 22,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 9\n    },\n    \"Mission District\": {\n        \"North Beach\": 17,\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 16,\n        \"Chinatown\": 16,\n        \"Union Square\": 15,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 17,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 12\n    },\n    \"Golden Gate Park\": {\n        \"North Beach\": 24,\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 16,\n        \"Chinatown\": 23,\n        \"Union Square\": 22,\n        \"Mission District\": 17,\n        \"Nob Hill\": 20\n    },\n    \"Nob Hill\": {\n        \"North Beach\": 8,\n        \"Pacific Heights\": 8,\n        \"Chinatown\": 6,\n        \"Union Square\": 7,\n        \"Mission District\": 13,\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": 17\n    }\n}\n\nmeetings = [\n    {'person': 'James', 'location': 'Pacific Heights', 'start_str': '20:00', 'end_str': '22:00', 'min_duration': 120},\n    {'person': 'Robert', 'location': 'Chinatown', 'start_str': '12:15', 'end_str': '16:45', 'min_duration': 90},\n    {'person': 'Jeffrey', 'location': 'Union Square', 'start_str': '9:30', 'end_str': '15:30', 'min_duration': 120},\n    {'person': 'Carol', 'location': 'Mission District', 'start_str': '18:15', 'end_str': '21:15', 'min_duration': 15},\n    {'person': 'Mark', 'location': 'Golden Gate Park', 'start_str': '11:30', 'end_str': '17:45', 'min_duration': 15},\n    {'person': 'Sandra', 'location': 'Nob Hill', 'start_str': '8:00', 'end_str': '15:30', 'min_duration': 15}\n]\n\nfor meeting in meetings:\n    meeting['available_start'] = time_to_minutes(meeting['start_str'])\n    meeting['available_end'] = time_to_minutes(meeting['end_str'])\n\nstart_time_minutes = 540\nstart_location = 'North Beach'\n\nbest_schedule = None\nbest_num_meetings = 0\nbest_travel_time = float('inf')\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(meetings):\n    current_time = start_time_minutes\n    current_loc = start_location\n    scheduled_meetings = []\n    num_meetings = 0\n    for meeting in perm:\n        travel_duration = travel_times[current_loc][meeting['location']]\n        current_time += travel_duration\n        start_meeting = max(current_time, meeting['available_start'])\n        end_meeting = start_meeting + meeting['min_duration']\n        if end_meeting > meeting['available_end']:\n            break\n        scheduled_meetings.append({\n            'person': meeting['person'],\n            'location': meeting['location'],\n            'start_time': start_meeting,\n            'end_time': end_meeting\n        })\n        num_meetings += 1\n        current_time = end_meeting\n        current_loc = meeting['location']\n    else:\n        num_meetings = len(scheduled_meetings)\n    \n    if num_meetings > 0:\n        total_travel = 0\n        loc_sequence = [start_location] + [m['location'] for m in scheduled_meetings]\n        for i in range(len(loc_sequence) -

The `minutes_to_time` function converts minutes back to the required time format.\n2. **Travel Times**: A dictionary `travel_times` stores the travel durations between each pair of locations, accounting for asymmetric travel times.\n3. **Meeting Constraints**: Each friend's meeting details (location, availability window, and minimum duration) are stored in a list of dictionaries. These details are converted to minutes for processing.\n4. **Permutation Processing**: All permutations of the meetings are generated to explore every possible order. For each permutation:\n   - The current time starts at 9:00 AM (540 minutes) at North Beach.\n   - For each meeting in the permutation, travel time to the meeting location is added to the current time. The meeting starts at the later of the arrival time or the friend's availability start time.\n   - If the meeting cannot fit within the friend's availability window, the permutation is abandoned early.\n5. **Optimal Schedule Selection**: The valid schedule with the most meetings is selected. If multiple schedules meet the same number of friends, the one with the least total travel time is chosen.\n6. **Output**: The optimal schedule is formatted as a JSON object with meetings listed in chronological order, including start and end times in 24-hour format."
