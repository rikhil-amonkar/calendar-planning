Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nBayview to Russian Hill: 23.\nBayview to Alamo Square: 16.\nBayview to North Beach: 21.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nRussian Hill to Bayview: 23.\nRussian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\nRussian Hill to North Beach: 5.\nRussian Hill to Financial District: 11.\nAlamo Square to Bayview: 16.\nAlamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nAlamo Square to North Beach: 15.\nAlamo Square to Financial District: 17.\nNorth Beach to Bayview: 22.\nNorth Beach to Russian Hill: 4.\nNorth Beach to Alamo Square: 16.\nNorth Beach to Financial District: 8.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Russian Hill: 10.\nFinancial District to Alamo Square: 17.\nFinancial District to North Beach: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Joseph will be at Russian Hill from 8:30AM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 60 minutes. Nancy will be at Alamo Square from 11:00AM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jason will be at North Beach from 4:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 15 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Financial District from 10:30AM to 3:45PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal meeting schedule that allows us to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering their availability, meeting duration requirements, and travel times between locations. The solution involves generating all possible permutations of meeting sequences, simulating each sequence to check feasibility, and selecting the sequence that maximizes the number of meetings while minimizing total waiting time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert all time constraints (start, end, and meeting durations) into minutes past midnight for easier calculations.\n2. **Travel Time Matrix**: Create a dictionary to store travel times between each pair of locations.\n3. **Friend Data**: Store each friend's details (name, location, availability window, and required meeting duration) in a list.\n4. **Generate Permutations**: For each possible number of meetings (from 4 down to 1), generate all permutations of friends to explore different meeting sequences.\n5. **Simulate Schedules**: For each permutation, simulate the schedule:\n   - Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM (540 minutes).\n   - For each friend in the permutation, calculate travel time from the current location to the friend's location.\n   - Determine arrival time and waiting time (if any) before the meeting starts.\n   - Ensure the meeting can be completed within the friend's availability window.\n6. **Track Best Schedule**: Track the schedule that maximizes the number of meetings. If multiple schedules meet the same number of friends, choose the one with the least total waiting time.\n7. **Output Result**: Convert the best schedule into a JSON-formatted itinerary with meeting details (start and end times in 24-hour format).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\nimport itertools\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\ndef main():\n    travel_times = {\n        \"Bayview\": {\n            \"Russian Hill\": 23,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 16,\n            \"North Beach\": 21,\n            \"Financial District\": 19\n        },\n        \"Russian Hill\": {\n            \"Bayview\": 23,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 15,\n            \"North Beach\": 5,\n            \"Financial District\": 11\n        },\n        \"Alamo Square\": {\n            \"Bayview\": 16,\n            \"Russian Hill\": 13,\n            \"North Beach\": 15,\n            \"Financial District\": 17\n        },\n        \"North Beach\": {\n            \"Bayview\": 22,\n            \"Russian Hill\": 4,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 16,\n            \"Financial District\": 8\n        },\n        \"Financial District\": {\n            \"Bayview\": 19,\n            \"Russian Hill\": 10,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 17,\n            \"North Beach\": 7\n        }\n    }\n    \n    friends = [\n        {\"name\": \"Joseph\", \"location\": \"Russian Hill\", \"start\": 510, \"end\": 1155, \"min_duration\": 60},\n        {\"name\": \"Nancy\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"start\": 660, \"end\": 960, \"min_duration\": 90},\n        {\"name\": \"Jason\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"start\": 1005, \"end\": 1305, \"min_duration\": 15},\n        {\"name\": \"Jeffrey\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"start\": 630, \"end\": 945, \"min_duration\": 45}\n    ]\n    \n    start_time = 540\n    start_location = \"Bayview\"\n    \n    best_num_meetings = 0\n    best_total_wait = float('inf')\n    best_schedule = None\n    best_perm = None\n    \n    for num in range(4, 0, -1):\n        for perm in permutations(friends, num):\n            current_time = start_time\n            current_location = start_location\n            total_wait = 0\n            schedule = []\n            valid = True\n            \n            for friend in perm:\n                if current_location != friend[\"location\"]:\n                    travel_time = travel_times[current_location][friend[\"location\"]]\n                else:\n                    travel_time = 0\n                arrival_time = current_time + travel_time\n                wait_time = max(0, friend[\"start\"] -

**Travel Calculation**: Computes travel time from the current location to the next friend's location.\n   - **Arrival and Waiting**: Determines arrival time and any necessary waiting time before the meeting starts.\n   - **Feasibility Check**: Ensures the meeting fits within the friend's availability window.\n6. **Optimal Schedule Selection**: Tracks the schedule with the most meetings and the least total waiting time.\n7. **Output**: Converts the optimal schedule into JSON format, listing each meeting's details (location, person, start, and end times).\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible meeting sequences, ensuring the optimal schedule is selected based on the given constraints."
