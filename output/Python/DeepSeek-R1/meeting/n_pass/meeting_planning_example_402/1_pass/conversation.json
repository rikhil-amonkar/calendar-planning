Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nGolden Gate Park to Haight-Ashbury: 7.\nGolden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Marina District: 16.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nGolden Gate Park to Union Square: 22.\nHaight-Ashbury to Golden Gate Park: 7.\nHaight-Ashbury to Sunset District: 15.\nHaight-Ashbury to Marina District: 17.\nHaight-Ashbury to Financial District: 21.\nHaight-Ashbury to Union Square: 17.\nSunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nSunset District to Haight-Ashbury: 15.\nSunset District to Marina District: 21.\nSunset District to Financial District: 30.\nSunset District to Union Square: 30.\nMarina District to Golden Gate Park: 18.\nMarina District to Haight-Ashbury: 16.\nMarina District to Sunset District: 19.\nMarina District to Financial District: 17.\nMarina District to Union Square: 16.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nFinancial District to Haight-Ashbury: 19.\nFinancial District to Sunset District: 31.\nFinancial District to Marina District: 15.\nFinancial District to Union Square: 9.\nUnion Square to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nUnion Square to Haight-Ashbury: 18.\nUnion Square to Sunset District: 26.\nUnion Square to Marina District: 18.\nUnion Square to Financial District: 9.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00AM. Sarah will be at Haight-Ashbury from 5:00PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 105 minutes. Patricia will be at Sunset District from 5:00PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 45 minutes. Matthew will be at Marina District from 9:15AM to 12:00PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 15 minutes. Joseph will be at Financial District from 2:15PM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 30 minutes. Robert will be at Union Square from 10:15AM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
