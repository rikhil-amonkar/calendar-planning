You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 30 minutes. Karen will be at Richmond District from 7:15PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 60 minutes.

Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."

Modifying the final state selection to only consider states where the return trip to Marina (travel time from last location to Marina) arrives by 21:00\n2. Among valid states, prioritize maximizing meetings then minimizing return arrival time\n3. Maintain all other logic for scheduling meetings within time windows\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndistrict_names = [\n    \"Marina District\",\n    \"Bayview\",\n    \"Sunset District\",\n    \"Richmond District\",\n    \"Nob Hill\",\n    \"Chinatown\",\n    \"Haight-Ashbury\",\n    \"North Beach\",\n    \"Russian Hill\",\n    \"Embarcadero\"\n]\n\ntravel_matrix = [\n    [0, 27, 19, 11, 12, 15, 16, 11, 8, 14],\n    [27, 0, 23, 25, 20, 19, 19, 22, 23, 19],\n    [21, 22, 0, 12, 27, 30, 15, 28, 24, 30],\n    [9, 27, 11, 0, 17, 20, 10, 17, 13, 19],\n    [11, 19, 24, 14, 0, 6, 13, 8, 5, 9],\n    [12, 20, 29, 20, 9, 0, 19, 3, 7, 5],\n    [17, 18, 15, 10, 15, 19, 0, 19, 17, 20],\n    [9, 25, 27, 18, 7, 6, 18, 0, 4, 6],\n    [7, 23, 23, 14, 5, 9, 17, 5, 0, 8],\n    [12, 21, 30, 21, 10, 7, 21, 5, 8, 0]\n]\n\nfriends = [\n    (\"Charles\", 1, 45, 690, 870),\n    (\"Robert\", 2, 30, 1005, 1260),\n    (\"Karen\", 3, 60, 1155, 1290),\n    (\"Rebecca\", 4, 90, 975, 1230),\n    (\"Margaret\", 5, 120, 855, 1185),\n    (\"Patricia\", 6, 45, 870, 1230),\n    (\"Mark\", 7, 105, 840, 1110),\n    (\"Melissa\", 8, 30, 780, 1185),\n    (\"Laura\", 9, 105, 465, 795)\n]\n\nn_friends = len(friends)\nn_districts = len(district_names)\n\nINF = 10**9\ndp = [[INF] * n_districts for _ in range(1 << n_friends)]\nparent = [[None] * n_districts for _ in range(1 << n_friends)]\n\n# Start at Marina (index 0) at 9:00 AM (540 minutes)\ndp[0][0] = 540\n\nfor mask in range(1 << n_friends):\n    for loc in range(n_districts):\n        if dp[mask][loc] == INF:\n            continue\n        for i in range(n_friends):\n            if mask & (1 << i):\n                continue\n            next_loc = friends[i][1]\n            travel_dur = travel_matrix[loc][next_loc]\n            arrival_time = dp[mask][loc] + travel_dur\n            win_start = friends[i][3]\n            win_end = friends[i][4]\n            min_dur = friends[i][2]\n            start_meeting = max(arrival_time, win_start)\n            end_meeting = start_meeting + min_dur\n            if end_meeting <= win_end:\n                new_mask = mask | (1 << i)\n                if end_meeting < dp[new_mask][next_loc]:\n                    dp[new_mask][next_loc] = end_meeting\n                    parent[new_mask][next_loc] = (mask, loc, i, start_meeting, end_meeting)\n\nbest_mask = 0\nbest_count = 0\nbest_arrival_back = INF\nbest_loc = 0\n\nfor mask in range(1 << n_friends):\n    count = bin(mask).count(\"1\")\n    for loc in range(n_districts):\n        if dp[mask][loc] == INF:\n            continue\n        return_time = travel_matrix[loc][0]\n        arrival_back = dp[mask][loc] + return_time\n        if arrival_back > 1260:  # Must return by 9:00 PM\n            continue\n        if count > best_count or (count == best_count and arrival_back < best_arrival_back):\n            best_count = count\n            best_arrival_back = arrival_back\n            best_mask = mask\n            best_loc = loc\n\nitinerary = []\nif best_count > 0:\n    mask = best_mask\n    loc = best_loc\n    meetings = []\n    while mask != 0:\n        if parent[mask][loc] is None:\n            break\n        prev_mask, prev_loc, friend_i, start_meeting, end_meeting = parent[mask][loc]\n        meetings.append((friend_i, start_meeting, end_meeting, loc))\n        mask = prev_mask\n        loc = prev_loc\n    meetings.reverse()\n    for meet in meetings:\n        friend_i, start, end, loc_index = meet\n        friend_name = friends[friend_i][0]\n        loc_name = district_names[loc_index]\n        hour_start = start // 60\n        min_start = start % 60\n        hour_end = end // 60\n        min_end = end % 60\n        start_str = f\"{hour_start}:{min_start:02d}\"\n        end_str = f\"{hour_end}:{min_end:02d}\"\n        itinerary.append({\n            \"action\": \"meet\",\n            \"location\": loc_name,\n            \"person\": friend_name,\n            \"start_time\": start_str,\n            \"end_time\": end_str\n        })\n\nresult = {\n    \"itinerary\": itinerary\n}\nprint(json.dumps(result))\n```\n\nThis solution now:\n1. Ensures return to Marina by 21:00\n2. Maximizes meetings within time constraints\n3. Minimizes return time when multiple optimal solutions exist\n4. Maintains all scheduling logic for meetings within windows"
