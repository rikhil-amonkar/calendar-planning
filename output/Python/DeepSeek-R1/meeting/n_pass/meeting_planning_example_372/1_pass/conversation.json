Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nSunset District to Alamo Square: 17.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nSunset District to Mission District: 24.\nAlamo Square to Sunset District: 16.\nAlamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nAlamo Square to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nAlamo Square to Mission District: 10.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\nRussian Hill to Mission District: 16.\nGolden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nGolden Gate Park to Mission District: 17.\nMission District to Sunset District: 24.\nMission District to Alamo Square: 11.\nMission District to Russian Hill: 15.\nMission District to Golden Gate Park: 17.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM.

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute an optimal meeting schedule that maximizes the number of friends met while adhering to their availability constraints and accounting for travel times between locations. The solution involves systematically evaluating possible meeting orders, calculating travel times, and ensuring all constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to meet as many friends as possible given their fixed availability windows and minimum meeting durations. The solution must account for travel times between different locations in San Francisco.\n2. **Key Insights**: \n   - Friends are divided into two groups: morning/afternoon (Daniel and Margaret) and evening (Charles and Stephanie).\n   - The evening meetings (Charles and Stephanie) have fixed start times due to their availability constraints.\n   - The morning meetings can be scheduled in any order, but the order affects total travel time.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Permutations**: Evaluate both possible orders of morning meetings (Daniel followed by Margaret, and vice versa).\n   - **Travel Time Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the total travel time and ensure meetings fit within the friends' availability windows.\n   - **Optimal Schedule Selection**: Choose the permutation with the minimal travel time that allows all meetings to be scheduled without conflicts.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves checking two permutations for the morning meetings, making the approach efficient with constant time complexity O(1) due to the fixed number of friends and permutations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    # Travel times in minutes\n    travel_times = {\n        \"Sunset District\": {\n            \"Alamo Square\": 17,\n            \"Russian Hill\": 24,\n            \"Golden Gate Park\": 11,\n            \"Mission District\": 24\n        },\n        \"Alamo Square\": {\n            \"Sunset District\": 16,\n            \"Russian Hill\": 13,\n            \"Golden Gate Park\": 9,\n            \"Mission District\": 10\n        },\n        \"Russian Hill\": {\n            \"Sunset District\": 23,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 15,\n            \"Golden Gate Park\": 21,\n            \"Mission District\": 16\n        },\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": {\n            \"Sunset District\": 10,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 10,\n            \"Russian Hill\": 19,\n            \"Mission District\": 17\n        },\n        \"Mission District\": {\n            \"Sunset District\": 24,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 11,\n            \"Russian Hill\": 15,\n            \"Golden Gate Park\": 17\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Define friends with their constraints (times in minutes since midnight)\n    daniel = {\n        \"name\": \"Daniel\",\n        \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n        \"available_start\": 8 * 60,      # 8:00\n        \"available_end\": 13 * 60 + 30,  # 13:30\n        \"min_duration\": 15\n    }\n    \n    margaret = {\n        \"name\": \"Margaret\",\n        \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n        \"available_start\": 9 * 60,    # 9:00\n        \"available_end\": 16 * 60,      # 16:00\n        \"min_duration\": 30\n    }\n    \n    charles = {\n        \"name\": \"Charles\",\n        \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n        \"available_start\": 18 * 60,     # 18:00\n        \"available_end\": 20 * 60 + 45,  # 20:45\n        \"min_duration\": 90\n    }\n    \n    stephanie = {\n        \"name\": \"Stephanie\",\n        \"location\": \"Mission District\",\n        \"available_start\": 20 * 60 + 30,  # 20:30\n        \"available_end\": 22 * 60,          # 22:00\n        \"min_duration\": 90\n    }\n    \n    # Group1: morning meetings (permutations)\n    group1 = [daniel, margaret]\n    group2 = [charles, stephanie]\n    \n    start_location = \"Sunset District\"\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    \n    # Evaluate permutations for Group1\n    candidates = []\n    for perm in permutations(group1):\n        current_loc = start_location\n        current_time = start_time\n        schedule_group1 = []\n        travel_time_total = 0\n        valid = True\n        \n        for friend in perm:\n            # Get travel time to friend's location\n            tt = travel_times[current_loc][friend[\"location\"]]\n            travel_time_total += tt\n            current_time += tt  # arrival time at friend's location\n            \n            # Calculate meeting start time (max of arrival and friend's available start)\n            meeting_start = max(current_time, friend[\"available_start\"])\n            # Check if meeting can be scheduled within friend's window\n            if meeting_start > friend[\"available_end\"] -

Evening meetings (Charles and Stephanie) are scheduled at fixed times.\n5. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON object with meeting details, including start and end times in 24-hour format.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes an optimal meeting schedule by leveraging permutations and travel time calculations, ensuring all constraints are met while maximizing the number of friends visited."
