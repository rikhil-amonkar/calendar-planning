    # Validate if the given constraints are possible with direct flights
    # We need to visit Riga, Amsterdam, and Mykonos with the given days
    # Total days should sum to 7 (2 + 2 + 5 - overlap if any)
    # But since we have to spend exactly those days, we need to find a sequence
    
    # Possible sequences considering direct flights:
    # 1. Riga -> Amsterdam -> Mykonos
    # 2. Riga -> Mykonos (not possible, no direct flight)
    # 3. Amsterdam -> Riga -> Mykonos (not possible, no direct flight Riga -> Mykonos)
    # 4. Amsterdam -> Mykonos -> Riga (but Riga needs to be visited between day 1-2)
    
    # The only possible sequence is Riga -> Amsterdam -> Mykonos
    
    # Verify if the sequence works with the constraints
    # Day 1-2: Riga (must include relatives visit between day 1-2)
    # Day 3: Fly to Amsterdam
    # Day 4-5: Amsterdam
    # Day 6: Fly to Mykonos
    # Day 7-11: Mykonos (but we have only 7 days)
    
    # This exceeds total days. Need to adjust.
    
    # Alternative approach: Since we must spend 5 days in Mykonos, 2 in Riga, and 2 in Amsterdam,
    # but total is 7, some days must overlap or be shared (which is not possible)
    # Hence, the constraints are impossible to satisfy exactly.
    
    # However, let's try to find the closest possible itinerary
    
    # Since Mykonos requires 5 days, we have to prioritize it
    # Possible sequence: Mykonos -> Amsterdam -> Riga
    # But no direct flight from Mykonos to Riga
    
    # Another sequence: Amsterdam -> Mykonos -> Riga
    # Day 1-2: Amsterdam
    # Day 3: Fly to Mykonos
    # Day 4-8: Mykonos (but only 7 days total)
    # Then no time for Riga
    
    # Another sequence: Riga -> Amsterdam -> Mykonos
    # Day 1-2: Riga
    # Day 3: Fly to Amsterdam
    # Day 4-5: Amsterdam
    # Day 6: Fly to Mykonos
    # Day 7: Mykonos (only 1 day, but need 5)
    
    # Not possible to satisfy all constraints
    
    # Given the constraints, it's impossible to visit all three cities with the exact days specified
    # So we'll prioritize the constraints in order:
    # 1. Must spend 2 days in Riga with relatives between day 1-2
    # 2. Must spend 5 days in Mykonos
    # 3. Spend 2 days in Amsterdam if possible
    
    # The only possible partial itinerary is:
    # Day 1-2: Riga (satisfies relatives visit)
    # Day 3: Fly to Amsterdam
    # Day 4-5: Amsterdam (2 days)
    # Then no time left for Mykonos
    
    # Or:
    # Day 1-2: Riga
    # Day 3: Fly to Amsterdam
    # Day 4: Amsterdam (1 day)
    # Day 5: Fly to Mykonos
    # Day 6-7: Mykonos (2 days)
    # But this doesn't satisfy 5 days in Mykonos or 2 in Amsterdam
    
    # Given the impossibility, we'll output the closest possible itinerary
