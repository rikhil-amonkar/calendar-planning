    # Since Venice has a workshop between day 5-10, and we have to be there for 6 days,
    # the only possible time to be in Venice is days 5-10 (6 days)
    # So, days 1-4 must be spent in other cities
    # We have to visit Mykonos (2 days) and Vienna (4 days) before Venice

    # Possible sequences:
    # 1. Mykonos -> Vienna -> Venice
    # 2. Vienna -> Mykonos -> Venice

    # Check if the sequence Mykonos -> Vienna -> Venice is possible
    # Mykonos (2 days) + Vienna (4 days) = 6 days, but we only have 4 days before Venice
    # So this sequence is not possible

    # Check sequence Vienna -> Mykonos -> Venice
    # Vienna (4 days) + Mykonos (2 days) = 6 days, but we only have 4 days before Venice
    # So this is also not possible

    # Alternative approach: Since we can't fit both Mykonos and Vienna before Venice,
    # we must start in Venice, but the workshop starts at day 5, so we can't be in Venice before day 5
    # This seems impossible, but let's re-examine constraints

    # Re-reading: "You would like to visit Venice for 6 days" and "attend a workshop in Venice between day 5 and day 10"
    # So the 6 days in Venice must include the workshop days, but not necessarily all days before day 5

    # Possible solution: Split Venice stay
    # But the problem says "visit Venice for 6 days", which could be contiguous or not

    # Assuming contiguous stay in Venice (most logical for a trip)
    # Then the only possible Venice stay is days 5-10 (6 days)
    # So days 1-4 must be split between Mykonos and Vienna

    # Total needed before Venice: Mykonos (2) + Vienna (4) = 6, but we have only 4 days
    # This is impossible, so we must adjust

    # Maybe Vienna includes travel days? Or overlapping?
    # Alternative interpretation: travel days are separate from stay days

    # Let's assume "stay in Vienna for 4 days" means 4 full days, plus travel days are extra
    # Similarly for others

    # Then total days needed:
    # Mykonos: 2 stay days + 1 travel day (to next city)
    # Vienna: 4 stay days + 1 travel day
    # Venice: 6 stay days
    # Total: 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 6 = 14 > 10, which doesn't fit

    # Maybe travel days are part of stay days (e.g., arrive on day 1 counts as day 1)
    # Then total is just sum of stay days: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 > 10, still doesn't fit

    # Alternative approach: Maybe the 6 days in Venice include days when you're traveling in/out
    # For example, arrive in Venice on day 5 (counts as day 1 in Venice), leave on day 10 (counts as day 6)

    # Then:
    # Venice: days 5-10 (6 days)
    # Days 1-4: need to fit Mykonos (2) and Vienna (4)
    # Not possible, since 2+4=6 > 4

    # Maybe the numbers include partial days
    # For example, arrive in Venice on day 5 evening, counts as 0.5 day, etc.

    # Given the constraints, the only possible solution is to reduce some stays, but that violates the given constraints

    # After careful consideration, the constraints seem impossible to satisfy exactly
    # The closest possible solution is to prioritize the workshop in Venice and adjust other stays

    # Final decision:
    # Venice must be days 5-10 (6 days)
    # For days 1-4, we can either:
    # 1. Spend all 4 days in Vienna (but need 2 in Mykonos)
    # 2. Spend 2 in Mykonos and 2 in Vienna (but need 4 in Vienna)
    # So we'll prioritize Vienna (4 days) and skip Mykonos
