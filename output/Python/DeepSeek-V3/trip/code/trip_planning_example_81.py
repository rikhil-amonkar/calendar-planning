    # 2. Mykonos -> Hamburg -> Budapest -> Mykonos

    # Let's say x days in Mykonos first, then Budapest, then Mykonos, then Hamburg
    # But this can't satisfy day 4 and day 9 in Mykonos

    # Option 1: Budapest (3) -> Mykonos (2)
    # Option 2: Hamburg (2) -> Budapest (3) -> but can't fit Mykonos after

    # Day 8: Fly to Mykonos
    # Day 8-9: Mykonos (2 days)

    # Option 2: Include Hamburg
    # Day 1-4: Mykonos (4)
    # Day 5: Fly to Hamburg
    # Day 5-6: Hamburg (2)
    # Day 7: Fly to Budapest
    # Day 7-9: Budapest (3)
    # But day 9 must be in Mykonos, so this doesn't work
    
    # Option 3:
    # Day 1-4: Mykonos (4)
    # Day 5: Fly to Budapest
    # Day 5-6: Budapest (2)
    # Day 7: Fly to Hamburg
    # Day 7-8: Hamburg (2)
    # Day 9: Fly to Mykonos

    # Option 4:
    # Day 1-3: Budapest (3)
    # Day 4: Fly to Mykonos
    # Day 4-6: Mykonos (3)
    # Day 7: Fly to Hamburg
    # Day 7-8: Hamburg (2)
    # Day 9: Fly to Mykonos
