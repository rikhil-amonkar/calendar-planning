You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 7 days in Riga. You are going to attend a wedding in Riga between day 11 and day 17. You want to spend 7 days in Budapest. You want to spend 4 days in Paris. You would like to visit Warsaw for 2 days. From day 1 to day 2, there is a annual show you want to attend in Warsaw.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nWarsaw and Budapest, Warsaw and Riga, Budapest and Paris, Warsaw and Paris, Paris and Riga.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 17 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
