You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Stuttgart for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Stuttgart between day 11 and day 13. You want to spend 4 days in Edinburgh. You want to spend 4 days in Athens. You would like to visit Split for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Split between day 13 and day 14 to tour together. You would like to visit Krakow for 4 days. You want to meet a friend in Krakow between day 8 and day 11. You want to spend 5 days in Venice. You want to spend 4 days in Mykonos.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nKrakow and Split, Split and Athens, Edinburgh and Krakow, Venice and Stuttgart, Krakow and Stuttgart, Edinburgh and Stuttgart, Stuttgart and Athens, Venice and Edinburgh, Athens and Mykonos, Venice and Athens, Stuttgart and Split, Edinburgh and Athens.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
