You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 2 days in Helsinki. You have to attend a workshop in Helsinki between day 1 and day 2. You want to spend 3 days in Warsaw. You plan to visit relatives in Warsaw between day 9 and day 11. You want to spend 4 days in Madrid. You want to spend 4 days in Split. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Reykjavik between day 8 and day 9. You would like to visit Budapest for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nHelsinki and Reykjavik, Budapest and Warsaw, Madrid and Split, Helsinki and Split, Helsinki and Madrid, Helsinki and Budapest, Reykjavik and Warsaw, Helsinki and Warsaw, Madrid and Budapest, Budapest and Reykjavik, Madrid and Warsaw, Warsaw and Split, from Reykjavik to Madrid.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 14 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
