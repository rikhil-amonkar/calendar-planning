    # 2. Start in Budapest, then Mykonos, then Hamburg, then back to Mykonos
    # 3. Start in Hamburg, then Budapest, then Mykonos
    
    # We need to find a sequence that satisfies all constraints

    # Option 1: Allocate days 1-3 in Mykonos (3 days), then need 1 more day
    # Then days 5-8 can be allocated to Budapest and Hamburg
    
    # Check if this works:
    # Days 1-3: Mykonos (3 days)
    # Day 4: Mykonos (conference)
    # Need 1 more Mykonos day (total 6), could be day 8 or 9
    # But day 9 is already Mykonos
    
    # So days 1-3: Mykonos (3)
    # Day 4: Mykonos (4)
    # Need 2 more Mykonos days (total 6), but day 9 is already allocated (5)
    # So need one more day, could be day 5 or 8
    
    # Let's choose day 8 as Mykonos
    # Then days 5-7: Budapest or Hamburg
    # We need 3 days in Budapest and 2 in Hamburg
    
    # Possible sequence:
    # Days 1-3: Mykonos
    # Day 4: Mykonos
    # Day 5-6: Budapest (2 days)
    # Day 7: Hamburg (1 day)
    # Day 8: Mykonos
    # Day 9: Mykonos
    # But this only gives 2 days in Budapest, need 3
    
    # Alternative: days 5-7: Budapest (3 days), then no time for Hamburg
    
    # Not working. Try another approach.
    
    # Option 2: Start in Budapest
    # Days 1-3: Budapest (3 days)
    # Day 4: Mykonos (conference)
    # Days 5-8: Need to allocate 5 Mykonos days (already 1 on day 4)
    # So need 4 more Mykonos days, and 2 Hamburg days
    
    # Possible:
    # Days 1-3: Budapest
    # Day 4: Mykonos
    # Days 5-6: Hamburg (2 days)
    # Days 7-8: Mykonos (2 days)
    # Day 9: Mykonos
    # Total Mykonos: day 4,7,8,9 (4 days) - need 6
    
    # Not enough. Try adding more Mykonos days.
    
    # Days 1-2: Budapest (2 days)
    # Day 3: Mykonos (1 day)
    # Day 4: Mykonos
    # Days 5-6: Hamburg (2 days)
    # Days 7-8: Mykonos (2 days)
    # Day 9: Mykonos
    # Total Mykonos: 3,4,7,8,9 (5 days) - need 6
    # Total Budapest: 1,2 (2 days) - need 3
    
    # Still not enough. Try another sequence.
    
    # Option 3: Start in Hamburg
    # Days 1-2: Hamburg (2 days)
    # Day 3: Budapest (1 day)
    # Day 4: Mykonos (conference)
    # Days 5-7: Budapest (3 days total, but already 1 on day 3)
    # Days 8-9: Mykonos
    # Total Mykonos: 4,8,9 (3 days) - need 6
    
    # Not working. Try another approach.
    
    # Alternative idea: Split Mykonos into two blocks
    # Block 1: Days 1-3 (3 days)
    # Day 4: Mykonos (conference)
    # Block 2: Days 8-9 (2 days)
    # Total Mykonos: 6 days
    # Days left: 5-7 (3 days)

    # Final working sequence:
    # Days 1-3: Mykonos (3 days)
    # Day 4: Mykonos (conference)
    # Days 5-7: Budapest (3 days)
    # Day 8: Hamburg (1 day)
    # Day 9: Mykonos (conference)
    # Total Mykonos: 1,2,3,4,9 (5 days) - need 6
    # Need one more Mykonos day. Adjust:
    
    # Days 1-3: Mykonos (3)
    # Day 4: Mykonos (4)
    # Day 5: Budapest (1)
    # Day 6: Hamburg (1)

    # Day 8: Budapest (3)

    # Days 1-4: Mykonos (4 days)
    # Day 5: Budapest (1)
    # Day 6: Hamburg (1)
    # Day 7: Budapest (2)
    # Day 8: Budapest (3)
    # Day 9: Mykonos (5)

    # Day 4: Mykonos (4)
    # Day 5: Budapest (1)
    # Day 6: Budapest (2)
    # Day 7: Budapest (3)
    # Day 8: Hamburg (1)
    # Day 9: Mykonos (5)
    # Need one more Mykonos day. Change day 8 to Mykonos:
    # Days 1-3: Mykonos (3)
    # Day 4: Mykonos (4)
    # Day 5: Budapest (1)
    # Day 6: Budapest (2)
    # Day 7: Budapest (3)
    # Day 8: Mykonos (5)
    # Day 9: Mykonos (6)
    # Now: Mykonos 6, Budapest 3, Hamburg 0 - missing Hamburg
    
    # Final solution: cannot satisfy all constraints with given flight connections
    # Best possible itinerary (prioritizing Mykonos and Budapest):
