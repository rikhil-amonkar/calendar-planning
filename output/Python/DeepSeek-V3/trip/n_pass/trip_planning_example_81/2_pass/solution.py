    # We must be in Mykonos on days 4 and 9
    # We need to spend 6 days in Mykonos, 3 in Budapest, and 2 in Hamburg
    
    # Solution approach:
    # 1. Start in Mykonos (days 1-3)
    # 2. Day 4 is Mykonos (conference)
    # 3. Fly to Budapest (day 5-7)
    # 4. Fly to Hamburg (day 8)
    # 5. Fly back to Mykonos (day 9)
    # But this only gives 5 Mykonos days
    
    # Better approach:
    # 1. Start in Budapest (days 1-3)
    # 2. Fly to Mykonos (day 4 - conference)
    # 3. Stay in Mykonos (day 5)
    # 4. Fly to Hamburg (day 6-7)
    # 5. Fly back to Mykonos (day 8-9)
    
    # This gives:
    # Mykonos: 4,5,8,9 (4 days) - still not enough
    
    # Final working solution:
    # 1. Start in Mykonos (days 1-4) - includes conference day 4
    # 2. Fly to Budapest (days 5-7)
    # 3. Fly to Hamburg (day 8)
    # 4. Fly back to Mykonos (day 9)
    # Mykonos days: 1,2,3,4,9 (5 days) - still missing 1
    
    # After careful consideration, here's the only possible solution that satisfies all constraints:
    itinerary = [
        {"day_range": "Day 1-3", "place": "Mykonos"},
        {"day_range": "Day 4", "place": "Mykonos"},
        {"day_range": "Day 5-7", "place": "Budapest"},
        {"day_range": "Day 8-9", "place": "Mykonos"}
    ]
    # This gives:
    # Mykonos: 1,2,3,4,8,9 (6 days)
    # Budapest: 5,6,7 (3 days)
    # Hamburg: 0 days - but we need 2
    
    # Wait, this doesn't satisfy Hamburg requirement
    
    # After realizing it's impossible to satisfy all constraints with given flight connections,
    # here's the closest possible solution that prioritizes conference days and Mykonos days:
    itinerary = [
        {"day_range": "Day 1-3", "place": "Mykonos"},
        {"day_range": "Day 4", "place": "Mykonos"},
        {"day_range": "Day 5-6", "place": "Hamburg"},
        {"day_range": "Day 7", "place": "Budapest"},
        {"day_range": "Day 8", "place": "Budapest"},
        {"day_range": "Day 9", "place": "Mykonos"}
    ]
    # This gives:
    # Mykonos: 1,2,3,4,9 (5 days)
    # Budapest: 7,8 (2 days)
    # Hamburg: 5,6 (2 days)
    
    # Still not perfect, but better Hamburg coverage
    
    # Final realization: It's impossible to satisfy all constraints with current flight connections
    # The only way would be to have direct flights between Hamburg and Mykonos
    
    # Therefore, we'll return the solution that meets most constraints
