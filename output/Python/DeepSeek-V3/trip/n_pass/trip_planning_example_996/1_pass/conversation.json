You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 5 days in Valencia. You would like to visit Riga for 5 days. You want to spend 3 days in Prague. You plan to visit relatives in Prague between day 7 and day 9. You want to spend 3 days in Mykonos. You are going to attend a wedding in Mykonos between day 1 and day 3. You want to spend 5 days in Zurich. You would like to visit Bucharest for 5 days. You plan to stay in Nice for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMykonos and Nice, Mykonos and Zurich, Prague and Bucharest, Valencia and Bucharest, Zurich and Prague, Riga and Nice, Zurich and Riga, Zurich and Bucharest, Zurich and Valencia, Bucharest and Riga, Prague and Riga, Prague and Valencia, Zurich and Nice.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 22 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
