    # We know we must be in Istanbul on days 12-13 (2 days)
    # And in Bucharest between days 16-19 (4 days)
    
    # Let's try to build the itinerary around these fixed points
    # First, place Istanbul (must include days 12-13)
    # Then place Bucharest (must include days 16-19)
    # Then fill the remaining days before, between, and after
    
    # Try different positions for Istanbul and Bucharest
    # Istanbul can be placed in multiple ways to cover days 12-13:
    # Option 1: Days 11-12 (but then day 13 isn't covered)
    # Option 2: Days 12-13 (perfect)
    # Option 3: Days 12-13 (same as option 2)
    # Option 4: Days 13-14 (but then day 12 isn't covered)
    # So only valid option is days 12-13
    
    # For Bucharest (4 days including 16-19):
    # Possible placements:
    # 1. 15-18 (covers 16-18)
    # 2. 16-19 (perfect)
    # 3. 17-20 (covers 17-19)
    # Only 16-19 fully covers the required range
    
    # So we'll fix:
    # Istanbul: days 12-13
    # Bucharest: days 16-19
    
    # Now we have:
    # Days 1-11: before Istanbul
    # Days 14-15: between Istanbul and Bucharest
    # Days 20-23: after Bucharest
    
    # Total remaining days: 11 + 2 + 4 = 17 days to allocate
    
    # Cities we still need to visit (excluding Istanbul and Bucharest)
    other_cities = [city for city in cities.keys() if city not in ["Istanbul", "Bucharest"]]
    
    # We need to select cities that sum to 17 days from these:
    # Possible combinations:
    # 1. Vienna (2) + Florence (4) + Reykjavik (4) + Riga (4) + Stuttgart (5) = 19 (too much)
    # 2. Manchester (5) + Riga (4) + Florence (4) + Vienna (2) = 15 (too little)
    # 3. Stuttgart (5) + Manchester (5) + Reykjavik (4) + Vienna (2) = 16 (too little)
    # 4. Stuttgart (5) + Riga (4) + Florence (4) + Vienna (2) = 15 (too little)
    # 5. Manchester (5) + Stuttgart (5) + Reykjavik (4) = 14 (too little)
    # 6. Reykjavik (4) + Florence (4) + Riga (4) + Vienna (2) = 14 (too little)
    # 7. Manchester (5) + Riga (4) + Reykjavik (4) + Vienna (2) = 15 (too little)
    # 8. Manchester (5) + Florence (4) + Reykjavik (4) + Vienna (2) = 15 (too little)
    
    # Hmm, none of these combinations sum to 17. Maybe we need to adjust our approach.
    # Alternative idea: maybe the Istanbul visit can be longer than 2 days
    # But the show is only on days 12-13, so we could stay longer if needed
    
    # Let me check the city durations again:
    # Total required: 23
    # Bucharest: 4 (fixed)
    # Istanbul: at least 2 (could be more)
    # So remaining: 23 - 4 - 2 = 17
    
    # But as we saw, no combination sums to 17. Maybe we need to include some cities multiple times?
    # Or maybe we need to adjust our fixed placement of Bucharest
    
    # Alternative approach: maybe Bucharest can be 15-18 (covering 16-18)
    # Then we'd have:
    # Istanbul: 12-13
    # Bucharest: 15-18
    # Then we'd have:
    # Days 1-11: before Istanbul
    # Days 14: between Istanbul and Bucharest
    # Days 19-23: after Bucharest
    # Total remaining: 11 + 1 + 5 = 17
    
    # Still same issue with combinations
    
    # Another approach: maybe we can split the Bucharest visit
    # But the problem says "workshop in Bucharest between day 16 and 19",
    # which implies consecutive days
    
    # After careful consideration, it seems impossible to satisfy all constraints with the given cities and durations.
    # The main issue is that the remaining 17 days can't be perfectly divided among the available cities.
    
    # However, looking back at the city list, I notice "Florence" is spelled as "Florence" in the flights dictionary
    # Let me fix that first
    
    flights["Florence"] = flights.pop("Florence", ["Vienna"])
    
    # Now let me try a specific itinerary that might work:
    # 1-5: Manchester (5)
    # 6-9: Riga (4)
    # 10-11: Vienna (2)
    # 12-13: Istanbul (2)
    # 14-17: Florence (4)
    # 18-21: Bucharest (4) - covers 16-19 if we adjust to 16-19
    # 22-23: Reykjavik (2) - but needs 4 days
    
    # This isn't working. After several attempts, it seems impossible to satisfy all constraints.
    
    # Therefore, I'll return an empty itinerary as no valid solution exists
    return {"itinerary": []}
