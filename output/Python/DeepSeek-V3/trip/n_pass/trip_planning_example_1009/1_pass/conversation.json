You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Riga for 4 days. You want to spend 5 days in Manchester. You would like to visit Bucharest for 4 days. You have to attend a workshop in Bucharest between day 16 and day 19. You want to spend 4 days in Florence. You would like to visit Vienna for 2 days. You plan to stay in Istanbul for 2 days. From day 12 to day 13, there is a annual show you want to attend in Istanbul. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 4 days. You would like to visit Stuttgart for 5 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBucharest and Vienna, Reykjavik and Vienna, Manchester and Vienna, Manchester and Riga, Riga and Vienna, Istanbul and Vienna, Vienna and Florence, Stuttgart and Vienna, Riga and Bucharest, Istanbul and Riga, Stuttgart and Istanbul, from Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Istanbul and Bucharest, Manchester and Istanbul, Manchester and Bucharest, Stuttgart and Manchester.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 23 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
