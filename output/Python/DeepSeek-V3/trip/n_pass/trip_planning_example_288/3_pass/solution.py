    # Since we only have 3 days before Stuttgart, we can:
    # 1. Do Vienna days 8-9 (2 days)
    # 2. Then Madrid day 10 (partial, but we'll complete later)

    # After Stuttgart, we have no days left, but Madrid needs 3 more days
    # This is a problem - we can't fit all required days
    
    # Alternative approach: skip Vienna to fit Madrid's 4 days in 8-11
    # But then Stuttgart can't be 11-15 (would need to be 12-16 which is beyond total_days)
    
    # Best solution is to accept we can't visit all cities fully
    # and prioritize the ones with fixed events
    
    # Verify all constraints:
    # - Total days: 15 (1-7 + 8-9 + 10 + 11-15)
    # - Wedding in Manchester days 1-7
    # - Workshop in Stuttgart days 11-15
    # - Manchester: 7/7 days
    # - Vienna: 2/2 days
    # - Stuttgart: 5/5 days
    # - Madrid: 1/4 days (couldn't fully fit)
    
    # Since we can't satisfy all constraints perfectly, we prioritize:
    # 1. Wedding and workshop dates (fixed)
    # 2. Complete stays in cities when possible
    # 3. Minimize partial stays
