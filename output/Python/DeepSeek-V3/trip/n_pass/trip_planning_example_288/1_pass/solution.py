    # After Manchester, possible cities to visit: Vienna, Stuttgart, Madrid
    # We need to fit Stuttgart's workshop between day 11-15
    # So after Manchester (day 7), we have days 8-15 left
    
    # Option 1: Go to Stuttgart immediately after Manchester (day 8)
    # But workshop is only required between day 11-15, so we can delay Stuttgart
    
    # Option 2: Go to Madrid or Vienna first, then Stuttgart
    
    # Check if we can fit Vienna (2 days) and Madrid (4 days) before Stuttgart
    # Total days after Manchester: 8 (8-15)
    # Vienna: 2 days (8-9)
    # Madrid: 4 days (10-13)
    # Stuttgart: 5 days (14-18) -> exceeds total days
    
    # Alternative: Vienna first (2 days), then Stuttgart (5 days), then Madrid (remaining)
    # Vienna: 8-9 (2 days)
    # Stuttgart: 10-14 (5 days, workshop covered)
    # Madrid: 15 (1 day) -> but Madrid needs 4 days
    
    # Another alternative: Madrid first, then Vienna, then Stuttgart
    # Madrid: 8-11 (4 days)
    # Vienna: 12-13 (2 days)
    # Stuttgart: 14-15 (2 days) -> but Stuttgart needs 5 days
    
    # Best option: Go to Stuttgart after Manchester, then Madrid, then Vienna
    # Stuttgart: 8-12 (5 days, workshop covered 11-12)
    # Madrid: 13-16 (4 days) -> exceeds total days
    
    # Not possible, need to adjust
    
    # Final plan: Manchester (1-7), Vienna (8-9), Madrid (10-13), Stuttgart (14-15)
    # But Stuttgart only gets 2 days, needs 5
    
    # Re-evaluate: Maybe Manchester doesn't need all 7 days in first stretch
    # Wedding is between day 1-7, but we can split Manchester days
    
    # New plan:
    # Manchester: 1-5 (5 days, wedding covered)
    # Then another city, then return to Manchester for remaining 2 days
    
    # But wedding is between day 1-7, so must be in Manchester continuously
    
    # Final solution: Accept that not all constraints can be perfectly met
    # Prioritize wedding and workshop
    
    # Manchester: 1-7 (7 days)
    # Stuttgart: 11-15 (5 days, workshop covered)
    # So between day 8-10, visit other cities
    
    # Days 8-10: 3 days
    # Need to fit Vienna (2) and Madrid (4)
    # Not possible, so choose one
    
    # Choose Vienna: 8-9 (2 days)
    # Then Madrid: 10-13 (4 days) but overlaps with Stuttgart
    
    # Alternative: Madrid: 8-11 (4 days), but overlaps with Stuttgart
    
    # Best compromise: Skip Vienna or Madrid
    
    # Since Vienna only needs 2 days, include it:
