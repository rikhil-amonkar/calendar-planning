You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Stuttgart for 4 days. During day 4 and day 7, you have to attend a conference in Stuttgart. You would like to visit Istanbul for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Istanbul between day 19 and day 22. You would like to visit Vilnius for 4 days. You would like to visit Seville for 3 days. You would like to visit Geneva for 5 days. You plan to stay in Valencia for 5 days. You plan to stay in Munich for 3 days. From day 13 to day 15, there is a annual show you want to attend in Munich. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 4 days. You have to attend a workshop in Reykjavik between day 1 and day 4.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nGeneva and Istanbul, Reykjavik and Munich, Stuttgart and Valencia, from Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Stuttgart and Istanbul, Munich and Geneva, Istanbul and Vilnius, Valencia and Seville, Valencia and Istanbul, from Vilnius to Munich, Seville and Munich, Munich and Istanbul, Valencia and Geneva, Valencia and Munich.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
