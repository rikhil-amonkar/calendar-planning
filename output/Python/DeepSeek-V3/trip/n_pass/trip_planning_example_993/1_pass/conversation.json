You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Riga for 2 days. You would like to visit Frankfurt for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Amsterdam. You want to meet a friend in Amsterdam between day 2 and day 3. You would like to visit Vilnius for 5 days. You have to attend a workshop in Vilnius between day 7 and day 11. You want to spend 2 days in London. You want to spend 3 days in Stockholm. You are going to attend a wedding in Stockholm between day 13 and day 15. You would like to visit Bucharest for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLondon and Amsterdam, Vilnius and Frankfurt, from Riga to Vilnius, Riga and Stockholm, London and Bucharest, Amsterdam and Stockholm, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, Frankfurt and Stockholm, Bucharest and Riga, Amsterdam and Riga, Amsterdam and Bucharest, Riga and Frankfurt, Bucharest and Frankfurt, London and Frankfurt, London and Stockholm, Amsterdam and Vilnius.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 15 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
