You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 3 days in Stockholm. You plan to stay in Hamburg for 5 days. You would like to visit Florence for 2 days. You would like to visit Istanbul for 5 days. From day 25 to day 29, there is a annual show you want to attend in Istanbul. You would like to visit Oslo for 5 days. You would like to visit Vilnius for 5 days. You plan to stay in Santorini for 2 days. You plan to stay in Munich for 5 days. You would like to visit Frankfurt for 4 days. You want to spend 5 days in Krakow. You have to attend a workshop in Krakow between day 5 and day 9.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nOslo and Stockholm, Krakow and Frankfurt, Krakow and Istanbul, Munich and Stockholm, Hamburg and Stockholm, from Krakow to Vilnius, Oslo and Istanbul, Istanbul and Stockholm, Oslo and Krakow, Vilnius and Istanbul, Oslo and Vilnius, Frankfurt and Istanbul, Oslo and Frankfurt, Munich and Hamburg, Munich and Istanbul, Oslo and Munich, Frankfurt and Florence, Oslo and Hamburg, Vilnius and Frankfurt, from Florence to Munich, Krakow and Munich, Hamburg and Istanbul, Frankfurt and Stockholm, from Stockholm to Santorini, Frankfurt and Munich, from Santorini to Oslo, Krakow and Stockholm, from Vilnius to Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 32 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
