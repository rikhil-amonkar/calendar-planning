You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 3 days in Venice. You plan to visit relatives in Venice between day 5 and day 7. You would like to visit London for 3 days. You would like to visit Lisbon for 4 days. You plan to stay in Brussels for 2 days. During day 1 and day 2, you have to attend a conference in Brussels. You want to spend 3 days in Reykjavik. You plan to stay in Santorini for 3 days. You want to spend 5 days in Madrid. You are going to attend a wedding in Madrid between day 7 and day 11.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nVenice and Madrid, Lisbon and Reykjavik, Brussels and Venice, Venice and Santorini, Lisbon and Venice, from Reykjavik to Madrid, Brussels and London, Madrid and London, Santorini and London, London and Reykjavik, Brussels and Lisbon, Lisbon and London, Lisbon and Madrid, Madrid and Santorini, Brussels and Reykjavik, Brussels and Madrid, Venice and London.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 17 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
