You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 3 days in Dublin. You would like to meet your friends at Dublin between day 7 and day 9 to tour together. You would like to visit Madrid for 2 days. You plan to visit relatives in Madrid between day 2 and day 3. You plan to stay in Oslo for 3 days. You would like to visit London for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Vilnius. You plan to stay in Berlin for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Berlin between day 3 and day 7.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLondon and Madrid, Oslo and Vilnius, Berlin and Vilnius, Madrid and Oslo, Madrid and Dublin, London and Oslo, Madrid and Berlin, Berlin and Oslo, Dublin and Oslo, London and Dublin, London and Berlin, Berlin and Dublin.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 13 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
