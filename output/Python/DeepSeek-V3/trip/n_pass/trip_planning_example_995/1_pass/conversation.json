You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Oslo for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Oslo between day 3 and day 4 to tour together. You want to spend 3 days in Stuttgart. You would like to visit Venice for 4 days. You plan to stay in Split for 4 days. You plan to stay in Barcelona for 3 days. From day 1 to day 3, there is a annual show you want to attend in Barcelona. You would like to visit Brussels for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Brussels between day 9 and day 11. You would like to visit Copenhagen for 3 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nVenice and Stuttgart, Oslo and Brussels, Split and Copenhagen, Barcelona and Copenhagen, Barcelona and Venice, Brussels and Venice, Barcelona and Stuttgart, Copenhagen and Brussels, Oslo and Split, Oslo and Venice, Barcelona and Split, Oslo and Copenhagen, Barcelona and Oslo, Copenhagen and Stuttgart, Split and Stuttgart, Copenhagen and Venice, Barcelona and Brussels.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
