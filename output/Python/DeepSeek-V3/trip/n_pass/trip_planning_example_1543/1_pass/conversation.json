You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Prague for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Prague between day 1 and day 3. You would like to visit Warsaw for 4 days. You would like to meet your friends at Warsaw between day 20 and day 23 to tour together. You want to spend 3 days in Dublin. You would like to visit Athens for 3 days. You would like to visit Vilnius for 4 days. You would like to visit Porto for 5 days. During day 16 and day 20, you have to attend a conference in Porto. You plan to stay in London for 3 days. You are going to attend a wedding in London between day 3 and day 5. You want to spend 2 days in Seville. You plan to stay in Lisbon for 5 days. You plan to visit relatives in Lisbon between day 5 and day 9. You plan to stay in Dubrovnik for 3 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nWarsaw and Vilnius, Prague and Athens, London and Lisbon, Lisbon and Porto, Prague and Lisbon, London and Dublin, Athens and Vilnius, Athens and Dublin, Prague and London, London and Warsaw, Dublin and Seville, Seville and Porto, Lisbon and Athens, Dublin and Porto, Athens and Warsaw, Lisbon and Warsaw, Porto and Warsaw, Prague and Warsaw, Prague and Dublin, Athens and Dubrovnik, Lisbon and Dublin, Dubrovnik and Dublin, Lisbon and Seville, London and Athens.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 26 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
