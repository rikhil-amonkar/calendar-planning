You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Paris for 5 days. You plan to stay in Florence for 3 days. You would like to visit Vienna for 2 days. You plan to visit relatives in Vienna between day 19 and day 20. You plan to stay in Porto for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Porto between day 1 and day 3. You want to spend 5 days in Munich. You want to spend 5 days in Nice. You want to spend 3 days in Warsaw. You are going to attend a wedding in Warsaw between day 13 and day 15.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nFlorence and Vienna, Paris and Warsaw, Munich and Vienna, Porto and Vienna, Warsaw and Vienna, from Florence to Munich, Munich and Warsaw, Munich and Nice, Paris and Florence, Warsaw and Nice, Porto and Munich, Porto and Nice, Paris and Vienna, Nice and Vienna, Porto and Paris, Paris and Nice, Paris and Munich, Porto and Warsaw.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
