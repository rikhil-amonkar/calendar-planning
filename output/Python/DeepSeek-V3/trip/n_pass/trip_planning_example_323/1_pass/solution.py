    # Possible sequence: Porto then Oslo or Oslo then Porto
    # Check direct flights from Split (last location):
    # Split has direct flights to London and Oslo
    # From Oslo we can go to Porto

    # Porto for remaining days (14-16, 3 days) - but we need 5 days total
    # This doesn't work, so alternative: Porto first then Oslo
    # But Porto only connects to Oslo, so we'd have to do Porto -> Oslo -> (no return)
    # Alternative: Split -> Oslo (2 days) -> Porto (3 days) - but we need 5 in Porto
    # Doesn't work. Maybe adjust earlier stays.

    # Re-evaluate:
    # Maybe not all 7 days in London at start
    # Let's try London days 1-6 (6 days), then Split 7-11 (5 days), then Oslo 12-13 (2 days), Porto 14-18 (but only 16 days)
    # That would be 6 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16, but Porto needs 5
    # Not working. Maybe initial assumption about London is too strict.

    # Alternative approach: London doesn't have to be all 7 days in first 7 days
    # Just that relatives are visited between day 1-7, so at least some days in London then
    # Let's try:
    # London 1-4 (4 days), Split 5-9 (5 days), Oslo 10-11 (2 days), Porto 12-16 (5 days)
    # Check constraints:
    # - Split show is 7-11: we're in Split until day 9 - covers days 7-9 (3 days of show)
    # Not enough show days. Need to be in Split until day 11.
    # Try:
    # London 1-2 (2 days), Split 3-7 (5 days), but show is 7-11
    # Doesn't work.

    # Original plan seems the only way to satisfy Split show constraint
    # So we have to adjust Porto days to fit
    # Maybe we can't satisfy all constraints perfectly, but prioritize:
    # - Split show days (must be in Split 7-11)
    # - Split total days (5) - covered by 7-11
    # - London relatives (1-7) and total (7) - covered by 1-7
    # - Oslo: 2 days - can do 12-13
    # - Porto: need 5 days but only have 14-16 (3 days)
    # So Porto days can't be fully satisfied, but we'll do our best

    # Final itinerary:
    itinerary = [
        {"day_range": "Day 1-7", "place": "London"},
        {"day_range": "Day 7-11", "place": "Split"},

    # Verify direct flights between transitions
    # London -> Split: yes
    # Split -> Oslo: yes
    # Oslo -> Porto: yes

    # Verify days:
    # London: 7 days (1-7)
    # Split: 5 days (7-11)
    # Oslo: 2 days (12-13)
    # Porto: 3 days (14-16)
    # Total: 7 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 17 (but we have 16 days)
    # Issue: day 7 is counted twice (in London and Split)
    # Need to adjust counts to ensure total is 16

    # Correct day counts:
    # Day 7 is transition: counted in both London and Split
    # So London: 1-7 is 7 days
    # Split: 7-11 is 5 days (but day 7 is already counted in London)
    # So total unique days: (1-6) + (7-11) + (12-13) + (14-16) = 6 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16
    # This works

    # Verify city days:
    # London: 1-7 (7 days) - satisfies relatives and total
    # Split: 7-11 (5 days, including show)
    # Oslo: 12-13 (2 days)
    # Porto: 14-16 (3 days - but we wanted 5)
    # Can't satisfy Porto fully, but this is the best we can do
