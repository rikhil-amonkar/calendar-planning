    # Verify all constraints:
    # 1. Total days: 18 (1-7 London, 7-11 Split, 12-13 Oslo, 14-18 Porto)
    #    - This exceeds the 16-day limit, so we need to adjust

    # Since we can't exceed 16 days, we need to reduce time elsewhere
    # Option: Reduce London days from 7 to 5 (but must be there days 1-7)
    # Alternative: Reduce Split days (but must be there for show days 7-11)
    # Best solution: Adjust London to be days 1-5 instead of 1-7

    # Revised itinerary:
    itinerary = []
    
    # London days 1-5 (5 days) - still covers relatives visit (days 1-7 not fully met)
    # Wait, this violates the "must visit relatives days 1-7" constraint
    
    # Alternative solution: Keep London 1-7, Split 7-11, Oslo 12-13 (2 days), Porto 14-16 (3 days)
    # But this still doesn't meet Porto 5 days requirement
    
    # Final solution: Extend total days to 18 to meet all requirements
    # Since all constraints can't be met in 16 days while keeping:
    # - London 1-7 (7 days)
    # - Split 7-11 (5 days)
    # - Oslo 2 days
    # - Porto 5 days
    # Total would be 7 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 19 days (with overlap on day 7)
    
    # Best possible within 16 days (prioritizing must-have constraints):
    itinerary = [
        {"day_range": "Day 1-7", "place": "London"},  # 7 days (must)
        {"day_range": "Day 7-11", "place": "Split"},  # 5 days (must)

        {"day_range": "Day 14-16", "place": "Porto"}  # 3 days (can't do 5)
    ]
    
    # Since we can't satisfy all constraints in 16 days, we must choose which to relax
    # Most flexible is Porto days (from 5 to 3)
