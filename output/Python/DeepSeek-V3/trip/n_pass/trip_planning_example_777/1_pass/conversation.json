You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Dublin for 5 days. You want to spend 3 days in Helsinki. You would like to meet your friends at Helsinki between day 3 and day 5 to tour together. You would like to visit Riga for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Reykjavik. You would like to visit Vienna for 2 days. From day 2 to day 3, there is a annual show you want to attend in Vienna. You want to spend 5 days in Tallinn. You are going to attend a wedding in Tallinn between day 7 and day 11.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nHelsinki and Riga, from Riga to Tallinn, Vienna and Helsinki, Riga and Dublin, Vienna and Riga, Reykjavik and Vienna, Helsinki and Dublin, Tallinn and Dublin, Reykjavik and Helsinki, Reykjavik and Dublin, Helsinki and Tallinn, Vienna and Dublin.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 15 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
