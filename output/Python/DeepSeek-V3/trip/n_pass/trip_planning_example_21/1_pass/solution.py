    # Since Venice must be visited for 6 days with workshop between day 5-10,
    # Venice must include day 5, so the latest it can start is day 5 - 5 (since 6 days)
    # But since workshop is from day 5, Venice must include days 5-10 (6 days)
    # So Venice is days 5-10
    
    # Then the remaining days are 1-4 (4 days)
    # We have to spend 2 in Mykonos and 4 in Vienna, but only 4 days left
    # So we must overlap or adjust, but since flights are direct:
    # Mykonos <-> Vienna, Vienna <-> Venice
    
    # Possible itineraries:
    # Option 1: Start in Mykonos, then Vienna, then Venice
    # - Mykonos: days 1-2 (2 days)
    # - Vienna: days 3-6 (4 days) but flight to Venice on day 5
    # But Venice must be days 5-10, so on day 5, must be in Venice
    # So:
    # - Mykonos: days 1-2 (2 days)
    # - Vienna: days 3-4 (2 days), then fly to Venice on day 5
    # But then Vienna only has 2 days, need 4
    
    # Option 2: Start in Vienna, then Mykonos, then Venice
    # - Vienna: days 1-4 (4 days)
    # - Mykonos: days 5-6 (but must be in Venice on day 5)
    # Not possible
    
    # Option 3: Start in Vienna, fly to Mykonos, back to Vienna, then Venice
    # - Vienna: days 1-2 (2 days)
    # - Mykonos: days 3-4 (2 days)
    # - Vienna: days 5 (but must be in Venice)
    # Not possible
    
    # Only possible way is to have Venice days 5-10 (6 days)
    # Then remaining 4 days must be split between Vienna and Mykonos
    # But need 4 in Vienna and 2 in Mykonos, which is 6 days, but only 4 left
    # This suggests the constraints cannot be fully satisfied
    
    # Re-evaluate: maybe the 6 days in Venice include the workshop days
    # And the workshop is within the 6 days
    # So Venice is 6 days, workshop is a subset (days 5-10)
    # So Venice must cover days 5-10, but can extend before
    # But total Venice days is 6, so must be exactly days 5-10
    
    # Then remaining days are 1-4 (4 days)
    # Need 4 in Vienna and 2 in Mykonos: impossible
    
    # Alternative interpretation: workshop is during days 5-10, but Venice visit is 6 days total within that
    # But original says "attend a workshop in Venice between day 5 and day 10" and "visit Venice for 6 days"
    # So likely Venice is 6 days overlapping with workshop days 5-10
    
    # Given the flight constraints, the only possible itinerary is:
    # - Vienna: days 1-4 (4 days)
    # - Fly to Venice on day 5 (counts as day in Vienna and Venice)
    # - Venice: days 5-10 (6 days)
    # But this misses Mykonos
    
    # Given the flight constraints (Mykonos only connects to Vienna), Mykonos must be visited via Vienna
    # So possible itinerary:
    # - Mykonos: days 1-2 (2 days)
    # - Vienna: days 3-6 (but fly to Venice on day 5)
    # So:
    # - Mykonos: days 1-2 (2 days)
    # - Vienna: days 3-4 (2 days)
    # - Venice: days 5-10 (6 days)
    # But Vienna only has 2 days, need 4
    
    # This seems impossible. Maybe the "stay in Vienna for 4 days" includes transit days
    # Then:
    # - Mykonos: days 1-2 (2 days)
    # - Vienna: days 3-6 (4 days, but fly to Venice on day 5)
    # So:
    # - Mykonos: days 1-2
    # - Vienna: days 3-5 (day 5 is also in Venice)
    # - Venice: days 5-10
    # Then Vienna has days 3-5 (3 days), still short
    
    # Conclusion: constraints cannot be fully satisfied with given flight options
    # But the closest possible is:
