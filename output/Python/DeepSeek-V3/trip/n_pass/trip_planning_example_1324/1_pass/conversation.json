You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Venice for 4 days. You plan to stay in Barcelona for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Barcelona between day 10 and day 12. You would like to visit Copenhagen for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Copenhagen between day 7 and day 10. You plan to stay in Lyon for 4 days. You would like to visit Reykjavik for 4 days. You plan to stay in Dubrovnik for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Dubrovnik between day 16 and day 20. You plan to stay in Athens for 2 days. You would like to visit Tallinn for 5 days. You would like to visit Munich for 3 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nCopenhagen and Athens, Copenhagen and Dubrovnik, Munich and Tallinn, Copenhagen and Munich, Venice and Munich, from Reykjavik to Athens, Athens and Dubrovnik, Venice and Athens, Lyon and Barcelona, Copenhagen and Reykjavik, Reykjavik and Munich, Athens and Munich, Lyon and Munich, Barcelona and Reykjavik, Venice and Copenhagen, Barcelona and Dubrovnik, Lyon and Venice, Dubrovnik and Munich, Barcelona and Athens, Copenhagen and Barcelona, Venice and Barcelona, Barcelona and Munich, Barcelona and Tallinn, Copenhagen and Tallinn.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 26 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
