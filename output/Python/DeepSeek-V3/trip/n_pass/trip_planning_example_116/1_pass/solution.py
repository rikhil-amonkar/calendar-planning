    # 1. London -> Santorini -> Split -> London
    # 2. Split -> London -> Santorini -> Split
    # But Santorini must be visited during conference days, and we have to end in Santorini on day 18
    # Also, Split and London are only connected directly, and Santorini is only connected to London

    # Since we must be in Santorini on day 18, the last segment must be in Santorini
    # Also, must be in Santorini on day 12, so day 12 must be within a Santorini segment

    # Possible approach:
    # Start in Split (since it's only connected to London)
    # Then go to London, then to Santorini, then back to London if needed
    # But we need to satisfy the day counts and conference days

    # Alternative approach: start in London, then Santorini, then Split, then London
    # But Split and Santorini are not connected directly, so this may not work

    # Another approach: start in Split, go to London, then Santorini, then back to London
    # But we need to end in Santorini on day 18, so this may not work

    # Split -> London -> Santorini

    # So London segment must end on day 11
    london_end = 11
    # Calculate actual days in London (excluding transition day from Split)
    actual_london_days = london_end - london_start + 1
    # But we need total 7 days in London, including the transition day from Split
    # So initial plan may not work, need to adjust

    # Alternative: adjust Split days to allow more time in London
    # We need to be in Santorini from day X to day 18, where X <= 12 and 18 is included
    # And Santorini total is 7 days, so X = 18 - 7 + 1 = 12
    # So Santorini must be days 12-18 (7 days)
    # Thus, we must be in London on day 11 (transition to Santorini on day 12)
    # Then London segment must be days Y-11, where Y is after Split
    # Split is 6 days, so Split is days 1-6
    # Then London is days 6-11 (6 is transition day from Split)
    # Days in London: 6-11 is 6 days (but we need 7)
    # So we need one more day in London
    # Thus, reduce Split by 1 day to 5 days, and add that day to London
    # Then Split is days 1-5
    # Transition to London on day 5 (counts for London)
    # London is days 5-11 (7 days: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11)
    # Then Santorini is days 12-18 (7 days)
