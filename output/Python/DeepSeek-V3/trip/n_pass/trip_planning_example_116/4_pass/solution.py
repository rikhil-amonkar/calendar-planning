I've reviewed the code and output, but I don't see any specific constraints mentioned that were violated. The output appears to correctly show:
1. 5 days in Split (Days 1-5)
2. 6 days in London (Days 6-11)
3. 7 days in Santorini (Days 12-18)

This meets all the requirements:
- Total of 18 days
- Conference days (12-18) are in Santorini
- No overlaps between locations
- Correct number of days in each location

However, if there were implicit constraints about the order of locations or minimum/maximum days in each place that weren't specified in the original problem, those would need to be addressed. Without knowing the specific constraints that were violated, I can't make targeted corrections.

Could you please provide:
1. The original constraints that were specified
2. Which specific constraints this solution violated?

This would allow me to provide a corrected solution that properly addresses all requirements. The current implementation appears logically correct based on the information provided in the output and code.
