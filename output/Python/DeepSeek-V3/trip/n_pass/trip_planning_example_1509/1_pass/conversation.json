You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Paris for 5 days. You would like to meet your friends at Paris between day 4 and day 8 to tour together. You would like to visit Warsaw for 2 days. You want to spend 2 days in Krakow. You have to attend a workshop in Krakow between day 17 and day 18. You plan to stay in Tallinn for 2 days. You want to spend 2 days in Riga. You are going to attend a wedding in Riga between day 23 and day 24. You would like to visit Copenhagen for 5 days. You want to spend 5 days in Helsinki. You want to meet a friend in Helsinki between day 18 and day 22. You plan to stay in Oslo for 5 days. You want to spend 2 days in Santorini. You plan to visit relatives in Santorini between day 12 and day 13. You plan to stay in Lyon for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nWarsaw and Riga, Warsaw and Tallinn, Copenhagen and Helsinki, Lyon and Paris, Copenhagen and Warsaw, Lyon and Oslo, Paris and Oslo, Paris and Riga, Krakow and Helsinki, Paris and Tallinn, Oslo and Riga, Krakow and Warsaw, Paris and Helsinki, Copenhagen and Santorini, Helsinki and Warsaw, Helsinki and Riga, Copenhagen and Krakow, Copenhagen and Riga, Paris and Krakow, Copenhagen and Oslo, Oslo and Tallinn, Oslo and Helsinki, Copenhagen and Tallinn, Oslo and Krakow, from Riga to Tallinn, Helsinki and Tallinn, Paris and Copenhagen, Paris and Warsaw, from Santorini to Oslo, Oslo and Warsaw.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
