    # But we have 3 (Split) + 5 (Riga) + 3 (Lisbon) + 4 (Tallinn) = 15 days
    # Wait, total days is 22, fixed days are 1-5 (5), 7-11 (5), 13-15 (3) => 13 days
    # So remaining days are 22 - 13 = 9 days
    # But remaining cities require 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 15 days. This is impossible.
    # There must be an error in the calculation.
    
    # Recalculate fixed days:
    # Berlin: 1-5 (5 days)
    # Lyon: 7-11 (5 days)
    # Bucharest: 13-15 (3 days)
    # Total fixed: 5 + 5 + 3 = 13 days

    # Remaining days: 22 - 13 = 9 days
    # Remaining cities:
    # Split: 3, Riga: 5, Lisbon: 3, Tallinn: 4
    # Total required: 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 15 days
    # 15 > 9, so it's impossible to fit all cities. Need to adjust.
    
    # Since the problem says "You plan to stay in...", maybe some are optional?
    # But the problem says "Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 22 days".
    # Assuming we must visit all cities, but the durations must be adjusted.
    # Alternatively, maybe the fixed events are part of the total days.
    # For example, Berlin is 5 days total, which includes the 1-5 event.
    
    # Reinterpret: the fixed events are part of the total days for each city.
    # So:
    # Berlin: total 5 days, already assigned 1-5 (5 days) -> done
    # Lyon: total 5 days, assigned 7-11 (5 days) -> done
    # Bucharest: total 3 days, assigned 13-15 (3 days) -> done
    # So remaining cities: Split (3), Riga (5), Lisbon (3), Tallinn (4)
    # And remaining days: days not in fixed events: 6, 12, 16-22 (total 9 days)
    # But we need to assign 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 15 days to 9 days. Impossible.
    
    # Alternative interpretation: the fixed events are in addition to the total days.
    # But then total would exceed 22 days.
    
    # Given the constraints, it's impossible to fit all cities. So we'll prioritize the fixed events.
    # And assign the remaining cities as much as possible.
    
    # Since the problem asks for a plan, we'll assume the fixed events are part of the total days.
    # And the remaining cities cannot all be fit, so we'll omit some.
    # But the problem says "you would like to visit" and "you plan to stay", implying they are desired but not mandatory.
    
    # For the sake of the problem, we'll assume the fixed events are mandatory and the rest are optional.
    # So we'll assign as many remaining cities as possible.
    
    # Remaining days: 6, 12, 16-22 (9 days)
    # We'll assign Split (3), Lisbon (3), and Tallinn (3 out of 4)
