You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Berlin for 5 days. From day 1 to day 5, there is a annual show you want to attend in Berlin. You would like to visit Split for 3 days. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Bucharest between day 13 and day 15. You plan to stay in Riga for 5 days. You plan to stay in Lisbon for 3 days. You would like to visit Tallinn for 4 days. You plan to stay in Lyon for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Lyon between day 7 and day 11.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLisbon and Bucharest, Berlin and Lisbon, Bucharest and Riga, Berlin and Riga, Split and Lyon, Lisbon and Riga, from Riga to Tallinn, Berlin and Split, Lyon and Lisbon, Berlin and Tallinn, Lyon and Bucharest.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 22 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
