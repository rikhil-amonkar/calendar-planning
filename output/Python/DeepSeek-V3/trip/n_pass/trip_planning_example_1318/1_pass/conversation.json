You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 2 days in Oslo. You want to meet a friend in Oslo between day 24 and day 25. You plan to stay in Helsinki for 2 days. You plan to stay in Edinburgh for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Riga. You would like to visit Tallinn for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Tallinn between day 4 and day 8. You would like to visit Budapest for 5 days. You would like to visit Vilnius for 5 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 5 days. You want to spend 4 days in Geneva.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPorto and Oslo, Edinburgh and Budapest, Edinburgh and Geneva, from Riga to Tallinn, Edinburgh and Porto, Vilnius and Helsinki, from Tallinn to Vilnius, Riga and Oslo, Geneva and Oslo, Edinburgh and Oslo, Edinburgh and Helsinki, Vilnius and Oslo, Riga and Helsinki, Budapest and Geneva, Helsinki and Budapest, Helsinki and Oslo, Edinburgh and Riga, Tallinn and Helsinki, Geneva and Porto, Budapest and Oslo, Helsinki and Geneva, from Riga to Vilnius, Tallinn and Oslo.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
