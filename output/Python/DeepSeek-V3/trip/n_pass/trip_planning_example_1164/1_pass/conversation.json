You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Reykjavik between day 3 and day 4. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Stockholm between day 4 and day 5 to tour together. You would like to visit Porto for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Porto between day 13 and day 17. You want to spend 3 days in Nice. You want to spend 4 days in Venice. You plan to stay in Vienna for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Vienna between day 11 and day 13. You would like to visit Split for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Copenhagen.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nCopenhagen and Vienna, Nice and Stockholm, Split and Copenhagen, Nice and Reykjavik, Nice and Porto, Reykjavik and Vienna, Stockholm and Copenhagen, Nice and Venice, Nice and Vienna, Reykjavik and Copenhagen, Nice and Copenhagen, Stockholm and Vienna, Venice and Vienna, Copenhagen and Porto, Reykjavik and Stockholm, Stockholm and Split, Split and Vienna, Copenhagen and Venice, Vienna and Porto.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 17 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
