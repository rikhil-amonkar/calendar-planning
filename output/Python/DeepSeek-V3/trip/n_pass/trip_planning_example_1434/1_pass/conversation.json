You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Rome for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Mykonos. You would like to meet your friends at Mykonos between day 10 and day 11 to tour together. You plan to stay in Lisbon for 2 days. You want to spend 5 days in Frankfurt. You are going to attend a wedding in Frankfurt between day 1 and day 5. You plan to stay in Nice for 3 days. You would like to visit Stuttgart for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Venice. You plan to stay in Dublin for 2 days. You want to spend 2 days in Bucharest. You plan to stay in Seville for 5 days. During day 13 and day 17, you have to attend a conference in Seville.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nRome and Stuttgart, Venice and Rome, Dublin and Bucharest, Mykonos and Rome, Seville and Lisbon, Frankfurt and Venice, Venice and Stuttgart, Bucharest and Lisbon, Nice and Mykonos, Venice and Lisbon, Dublin and Lisbon, Venice and Nice, Rome and Seville, Frankfurt and Rome, Nice and Dublin, Rome and Bucharest, Frankfurt and Dublin, Rome and Dublin, Venice and Dublin, Rome and Lisbon, Frankfurt and Lisbon, Nice and Rome, Frankfurt and Nice, Frankfurt and Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Bucharest, Lisbon and Stuttgart, Nice and Lisbon, Seville and Dublin.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 23 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
