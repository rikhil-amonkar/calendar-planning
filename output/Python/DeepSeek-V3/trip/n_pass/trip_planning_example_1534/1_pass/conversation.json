You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Warsaw for 4 days. You plan to stay in Venice for 3 days. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 3 days. You would like to visit Salzburg for 4 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Salzburg between day 22 and day 25. You want to spend 2 days in Amsterdam. You want to spend 5 days in Barcelona. You would like to meet your friends at Barcelona between day 2 and day 6 to tour together. You plan to stay in Paris for 2 days. You have to attend a workshop in Paris between day 1 and day 2. You want to spend 4 days in Hamburg. During day 19 and day 22, you have to attend a conference in Hamburg. You plan to stay in Florence for 5 days. You want to spend 2 days in Tallinn. You want to meet a friend in Tallinn between day 11 and day 12.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nParis and Venice, Barcelona and Amsterdam, Amsterdam and Warsaw, Amsterdam and Vilnius, Barcelona and Warsaw, Warsaw and Venice, Amsterdam and Hamburg, Barcelona and Hamburg, Barcelona and Florence, Barcelona and Venice, Paris and Hamburg, Paris and Vilnius, Paris and Amsterdam, Paris and Florence, Florence and Amsterdam, Vilnius and Warsaw, Barcelona and Tallinn, Paris and Warsaw, Tallinn and Warsaw, from Tallinn to Vilnius, Amsterdam and Tallinn, Paris and Tallinn, Paris and Barcelona, Venice and Hamburg, Warsaw and Hamburg, Hamburg and Salzburg, Amsterdam and Venice.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
