You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Oslo for 5 days. You want to spend 5 days in Stuttgart. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 2 days. During day 1 and day 2, you have to attend a conference in Reykjavik. You plan to stay in Split for 3 days. You plan to stay in Geneva for 2 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Porto between day 19 and day 21. You want to spend 5 days in Tallinn. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Stockholm between day 2 and day 4.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nfrom Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Stockholm and Tallinn, Stockholm and Oslo, Stuttgart and Porto, Oslo and Split, Stockholm and Stuttgart, Reykjavik and Oslo, Oslo and Geneva, Stockholm and Split, Reykjavik and Stockholm, Split and Stuttgart, Tallinn and Oslo, Stockholm and Geneva, Oslo and Porto, Geneva and Porto, Geneva and Split.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 21 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
