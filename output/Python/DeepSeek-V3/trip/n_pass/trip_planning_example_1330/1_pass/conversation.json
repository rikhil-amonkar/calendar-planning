You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Salzburg for 2 days. You want to spend 5 days in Venice. You would like to visit Bucharest for 4 days. You would like to visit Brussels for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Brussels between day 21 and day 22 to tour together. You want to spend 4 days in Hamburg. You want to spend 4 days in Copenhagen. You are going to attend a wedding in Copenhagen between day 18 and day 21. You plan to stay in Nice for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Nice between day 9 and day 11. You plan to stay in Zurich for 5 days. You plan to stay in Naples for 4 days. You have to attend a workshop in Naples between day 22 and day 25.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nZurich and Brussels, Bucharest and Copenhagen, Venice and Brussels, Nice and Zurich, Hamburg and Nice, Zurich and Naples, Hamburg and Bucharest, Zurich and Copenhagen, Bucharest and Brussels, Hamburg and Brussels, Venice and Naples, Venice and Copenhagen, Bucharest and Naples, Hamburg and Copenhagen, Venice and Zurich, Nice and Brussels, Hamburg and Venice, Copenhagen and Naples, Nice and Naples, Hamburg and Zurich, Salzburg and Hamburg, Zurich and Bucharest, Brussels and Naples, Copenhagen and Brussels, Venice and Nice, Nice and Copenhagen.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
