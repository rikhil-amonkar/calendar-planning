You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 2 days in Oslo. From day 16 to day 17, there is a annual show you want to attend in Oslo. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 5 days. You want to meet a friend in Reykjavik between day 9 and day 13. You would like to visit Stockholm for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Munich. You plan to visit relatives in Munich between day 13 and day 16. You plan to stay in Frankfurt for 4 days. You have to attend a workshop in Frankfurt between day 17 and day 20. You would like to visit Barcelona for 3 days. You would like to visit Bucharest for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Split.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nReykjavik and Munich, Munich and Frankfurt, Split and Oslo, Reykjavik and Oslo, Bucharest and Munich, Oslo and Frankfurt, Bucharest and Barcelona, Barcelona and Frankfurt, Reykjavik and Frankfurt, Barcelona and Stockholm, Barcelona and Reykjavik, Stockholm and Reykjavik, Barcelona and Split, Bucharest and Oslo, Bucharest and Frankfurt, Split and Stockholm, Barcelona and Oslo, Stockholm and Munich, Stockholm and Oslo, Split and Frankfurt, Barcelona and Munich, Stockholm and Frankfurt, Munich and Oslo, Split and Munich.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
