    # Direct flights: Bucharest <-> Lyon, Lyon <-> Porto
    # No direct flight between Bucharest and Porto
    
    # Constraints:
    # 1. Must be in Bucharest for the wedding between day 1 and 7
    # 2. Must spend exactly 7 days in Bucharest (including travel days)
    # 3. Must spend exactly 7 days in Lyon (including travel days)
    # 4. Must spend exactly 4 days in Porto (including travel days)
    
    # Since wedding is in Bucharest between day 1-7, Bucharest must include day 1
    # Possible itineraries:
    # Option 1: Start in Bucharest, then Lyon, then Porto
    # Option 2: Start in Bucharest, then Porto (but no direct flight), so invalid
    # Only Option 1 is possible
    
    # Bucharest must be first, covering days 1-7 (since wedding is between 1-7)
    # Then Lyon, then Porto
    
    # Days in Bucharest: 1-7 (7 days)
    # Travel from Bucharest to Lyon on day 7 (counts as day in both)
    # Days in Lyon: 7-14 (7 days, but day 7 is already counted in Bucharest)
    # So actual days in Lyon: 8-14 (6 days) + day 7 (counted in Bucharest) = 7 days
    # Travel from Lyon to Porto on day 14 (counts as day in both)
    # Days in Porto: 14-16 (2 days) + day 14 (counted in Lyon) = 3 days (but need 4)
    # This doesn't work, so adjust
    
    # Alternative:
    # Bucharest: 1-6 (6 days)
    # Travel to Lyon on day 6 (counts in both)
    # Lyon: 6-13 (7 days, day 6 counts in both)
    # Travel to Porto on day 13 (counts in both)
    # Porto: 13-16 (3 days + day 13) = 4 days
    # Bucharest: 6 days + day 6 (counted in Lyon) = 7 days
    # This fits all constraints
