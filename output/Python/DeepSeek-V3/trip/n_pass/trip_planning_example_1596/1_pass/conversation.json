You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Bucharest for 2 days. You plan to stay in Krakow for 4 days. You plan to stay in Munich for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Munich between day 18 and day 20. You plan to stay in Barcelona for 5 days. You want to spend 5 days in Warsaw. During day 25 and day 29, you have to attend a conference in Warsaw. You plan to stay in Budapest for 5 days. From day 9 to day 13, there is a annual show you want to attend in Budapest. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Stockholm between day 17 and day 18 to tour together. You would like to visit Riga for 5 days. You want to spend 5 days in Edinburgh. You want to meet a friend in Edinburgh between day 1 and day 5. You plan to stay in Vienna for 5 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBudapest and Munich, Bucharest and Riga, Munich and Krakow, Munich and Warsaw, Munich and Bucharest, Edinburgh and Stockholm, Barcelona and Warsaw, Edinburgh and Krakow, Barcelona and Munich, Stockholm and Krakow, Budapest and Vienna, Barcelona and Stockholm, Stockholm and Munich, Edinburgh and Budapest, Barcelona and Riga, Edinburgh and Barcelona, Vienna and Riga, Barcelona and Budapest, Bucharest and Warsaw, Vienna and Krakow, Edinburgh and Munich, Barcelona and Bucharest, Edinburgh and Riga, Vienna and Stockholm, Warsaw and Krakow, Barcelona and Krakow, from Riga to Munich, Vienna and Bucharest, Budapest and Warsaw, Vienna and Warsaw, Barcelona and Vienna, Budapest and Bucharest, Vienna and Munich, Riga and Warsaw, Stockholm and Riga, Stockholm and Warsaw.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 32 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
