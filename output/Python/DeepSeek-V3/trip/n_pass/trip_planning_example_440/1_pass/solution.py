        # Geneva -> Split: yes (Geneva and Split)
        # Split -> Vilnius: yes (Split and Vilnius)

        # Helsinki -> Reykjavik: yes (Helsinki and Reykjavik)

        # Geneva: days 1-6 (but overlaps with transitions)
        # Split: days 6-7 (transition on day 6)
        # Vilnius: days 7-9 (as required)
        # Helsinki: days 9-10 (transition on day 9)
        # Reykjavik: days 10-12 (as required)
        
        # Count days:
        # Geneva: days 1-6 (6 days, but day 6 is also Split)
        # Split: day 6-7 (2 days, but day 6 is also Geneva, day 7 is Vilnius)
        # Wait, this doesn't satisfy Split's 2 days
        
        # Alternative: start in Split
        # Split: days 1-2
        # Then to Geneva: day 2-8 (Geneva: days 2-8, 7 days, but need 6)
        # Then to Helsinki: day 8-10
        # Then to Reykjavik: day 10-12
        # Vilnius is missing
        
        # Another alternative: start in Helsinki
        # Helsinki: days 1-2
        # Then to Vilnius: day 2-5 (Vilnius: days 2-5, but need days 7-9)
        # Doesn't work
        
        # Another approach: since Reykjavik is fixed at 10-12 and Vilnius at 7-9,
        # we need to fit the rest around that
        
        # Possible itinerary:
        # Geneva: days 1-6 (but need to transition to Vilnius by day 7)
        # From Geneva, can go to Split or Helsinki
        # If to Split: day 6-8 (Split: days 6-8, but Vilnius is 7-9)
        # Then Split to Vilnius: day 8, but Vilnius starts at 7
        # Doesn't work
        
        # If Geneva to Helsinki: day 6-8 (Helsinki: days 6-8)
        # Then Helsinki to Vilnius: day 8, but Vilnius starts at 7
        # Doesn't work
        
        # Alternative: start in Split
        # Split: days 1-2
        # Then to Geneva: day 2-8 (Geneva: days 2-8)
        # Then Geneva to Helsinki: day 8-10
        # Then Helsinki to Reykjavik: day 10-12
        # Vilnius is missing
        
        # Another idea: include Vilnius in the middle
        # Start in Geneva: days 1-6
        # Then to Split: day 6-8
        # Then to Vilnius: day 8-9 (but Vilnius needs 3 days: 7-9)
        # Doesn't work
        
        # After several attempts, here's a feasible itinerary:
        # Day 1-2: Split
        # Day 2-3: Geneva (transition on day 2)
        # Day 3-6: Geneva
        # Day 6-7: Helsinki (transition on day 6)
        # Day 7-9: Vilnius
        # Day 9-10: Helsinki (transition on day 9)
        # Day 10-12: Reykjavik
        
        # Count days:
        # Split: days 1-2 (2 days)
        # Geneva: days 2-6 (5 days, but need 6)
        # Doesn't work
        
        # Final working itinerary:
        # Day 1-6: Geneva
        # Day 6-7: Split (transition on day 6)
        # Day 7-9: Vilnius
        # Day 9-10: Helsinki (transition on day 9)
        # Day 10-12: Reykjavik
        
        # Count days:
        # Geneva: days 1-6 (6 days)
        # Split: day 6-7 (2 days, counting day 6 and 7)
        # Vilnius: days 7-9 (3 days)
        # Helsinki: day 9-10 (2 days, counting day 9 and 10)
        # Reykjavik: days 10-12 (3 days)
        # Total: 6 (Geneva) + 2 (Split) + 3 (Vilnius) + 2 (Helsinki) + 3 (Reykjavik) = 16
        # But transition days are counted twice, so actual total is:
        # Geneva: 1-5 (day 6 is transition)
        # Split: 6-7
        # Vilnius: 7-9
        # Helsinki: 9-10
        # Reykjavik: 10-12
        # Total: 5 (Geneva) + 2 (Split) + 3 (Vilnius) + 2 (Helsinki) + 3 (Reykjavik) = 15
        # Still over 12, but the note says transition days count for both
