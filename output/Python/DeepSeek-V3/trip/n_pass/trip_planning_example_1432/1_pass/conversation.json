You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Frankfurt for 4 days. You plan to stay in Salzburg for 5 days. You plan to stay in Athens for 5 days. You have to attend a workshop in Athens between day 14 and day 18. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 5 days. You would like to visit Bucharest for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Valencia. From day 5 to day 6, there is a annual show you want to attend in Valencia. You would like to visit Vienna for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Vienna between day 6 and day 10. You would like to visit Amsterdam for 3 days. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Stockholm between day 1 and day 3. You plan to stay in Riga for 3 days. During day 18 and day 20, you have to attend a conference in Riga.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nValencia and Frankfurt, Vienna and Bucharest, from Valencia to Athens, Athens and Bucharest, Riga and Frankfurt, Stockholm and Athens, Amsterdam and Bucharest, from Athens to Riga, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, Stockholm and Vienna, Vienna and Riga, Amsterdam and Reykjavik, Reykjavik and Frankfurt, Stockholm and Amsterdam, Amsterdam and Valencia, Vienna and Frankfurt, Valencia and Bucharest, Bucharest and Frankfurt, Stockholm and Frankfurt, Valencia and Vienna, from Reykjavik to Athens, Frankfurt and Salzburg, Amsterdam and Vienna, Stockholm and Reykjavik, Amsterdam and Riga, Stockholm and Riga, Vienna and Reykjavik, Amsterdam and Athens, Athens and Frankfurt, Vienna and Athens, Riga and Bucharest.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 29 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
