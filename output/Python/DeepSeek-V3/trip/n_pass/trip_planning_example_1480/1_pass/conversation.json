You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Istanbul for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Vienna. You plan to stay in Riga for 2 days. You plan to stay in Brussels for 2 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Brussels between day 26 and day 27. You plan to stay in Madrid for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Vilnius. You would like to meet your friends at Vilnius between day 20 and day 23 to tour together. You want to spend 5 days in Venice. You have to attend a workshop in Venice between day 7 and day 11. You plan to stay in Geneva for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Geneva between day 1 and day 4. You plan to stay in Munich for 5 days. You would like to visit Reykjavik for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMunich and Vienna, Istanbul and Brussels, Vienna and Vilnius, Madrid and Munich, Venice and Brussels, Riga and Brussels, Geneva and Istanbul, Munich and Reykjavik, Vienna and Istanbul, Riga and Istanbul, Reykjavik and Vienna, Venice and Munich, Madrid and Venice, Vilnius and Istanbul, Venice and Vienna, Venice and Istanbul, from Reykjavik to Madrid, from Riga to Munich, Munich and Istanbul, Reykjavik and Brussels, Vilnius and Brussels, from Vilnius to Munich, Madrid and Vienna, Vienna and Riga, Geneva and Vienna, Madrid and Brussels, Vienna and Brussels, Geneva and Brussels, Geneva and Madrid, Munich and Brussels, Madrid and Istanbul, Geneva and Munich, from Riga to Vilnius.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 27 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
