You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 2 days in Zurich. During day 7 and day 8, you have to attend a conference in Zurich. You want to spend 2 days in Bucharest. You would like to visit Hamburg for 5 days. You would like to visit Barcelona for 4 days. You want to spend 5 days in Reykjavik. You plan to visit relatives in Reykjavik between day 9 and day 13. You would like to visit Stuttgart for 5 days. You want to spend 2 days in Stockholm. You plan to stay in Tallinn for 4 days. You want to spend 5 days in Milan. You would like to meet your friends at Milan between day 3 and day 7 to tour together. You plan to stay in London for 3 days. From day 1 to day 3, there is a annual show you want to attend in London.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLondon and Hamburg, London and Reykjavik, Milan and Barcelona, Reykjavik and Barcelona, from Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Stockholm and Reykjavik, London and Stuttgart, Milan and Zurich, London and Barcelona, Stockholm and Hamburg, Zurich and Barcelona, Stockholm and Stuttgart, Milan and Hamburg, Stockholm and Tallinn, Hamburg and Bucharest, London and Bucharest, Milan and Stockholm, Stuttgart and Hamburg, London and Zurich, Milan and Reykjavik, London and Stockholm, Milan and Stuttgart, Stockholm and Barcelona, London and Milan, Zurich and Hamburg, Bucharest and Barcelona, Zurich and Stockholm, Barcelona and Tallinn, Zurich and Tallinn, Hamburg and Barcelona, Stuttgart and Barcelona, Zurich and Reykjavik, Zurich and Bucharest.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 28 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
