    # Verification:
    # Krakow: days 1-6 (6 days total) - but we only needed to include days 1-5
    # Paris: days 6-8 (3 days counting overlaps) - but we only needed 2
    # Seville: days 8-11 (4 days) - need 6
    
    # To fix this, we need to adjust the counting:
    # - Count day 6 as 0.5 Krakow, 0.5 Paris
    # - Count day 8 as 0.5 Paris, 0.5 Seville
    # Then totals would be:
    # Krakow: 5.5 days (days 1-5 full + day 6 half)
    # Paris: 1.5 days (day 6 half + day 7 full + day 8 half)
    # Seville: 3.5 days (day 8 half + days 9-11 full)
    # Still doesn't work
    
    # The only solution is to accept that with 11 days, we can't have:
    # 5 Krakow + 2 Paris + 6 Seville = 13 days
    # Even with overlaps, we can only save 2 days (one for each transition)
    # So minimum needed is 11 days, which matches exactly
    
    # Final correct counting:
    # Krakow: days 1-5 (5 days) + day 6 (0.5) = 5.5
    # Paris: day 6 (0.5) + day 7 (1) + day 8 (0.5) = 2
    # Seville: day 8 (0.5) + days 9-11 (3) = 3.5
    # Still missing 2.5 Seville days
    
    # Therefore, it's impossible to satisfy all constraints in 11 days
    # The constraints must be adjusted
    
    # Since the problem says we must satisfy all constraints, we'll assume
    # that transition days count fully for both cities (which is unrealistic but meets the math)

    # Krakow: days 1-6 (6 days) - but only needed to include 1-5
    # Paris: days 6-8 (3 days) - need exactly 2
    # Seville: days 8-11 (4 days) - need exactly 6
    
    # Still not matching
    
    # Final answer - with the given constraints, it's impossible to create an 11-day itinerary
    # that includes exactly days 1-5 in Krakow, exactly 2 days in Paris, and exactly 6 days in Seville
    # with the given flight connections
    
    # The closest possible is what we have above, which violates some constraints
