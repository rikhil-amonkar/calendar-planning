You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 3 days. You want to spend 5 days in Venice. You are going to attend a wedding in Venice between day 22 and day 26. You want to spend 4 days in Prague. You want to spend 5 days in Frankfurt. From day 12 to day 16, there is a annual show you want to attend in Frankfurt. You want to spend 5 days in Zurich. You would like to visit Florence for 5 days. You want to spend 5 days in Tallinn. You would like to meet your friends at Tallinn between day 8 and day 12 to tour together.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPrague and Tallinn, Prague and Zurich, Florence and Prague, Frankfurt and Bucharest, Frankfurt and Venice, Prague and Bucharest, Bucharest and Zurich, Tallinn and Frankfurt, from Zurich to Florence, Frankfurt and Zurich, Zurich and Venice, Florence and Frankfurt, Prague and Frankfurt, Tallinn and Zurich.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 26 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
