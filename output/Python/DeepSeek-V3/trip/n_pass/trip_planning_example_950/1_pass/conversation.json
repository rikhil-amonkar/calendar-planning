You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Mykonos for 3 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Mykonos between day 4 and day 6. You plan to stay in Riga for 3 days. You plan to stay in Munich for 4 days. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 4 days. You would like to visit Rome for 4 days. During day 1 and day 4, you have to attend a conference in Rome. You would like to visit Nice for 3 days. You would like to visit Krakow for 2 days. From day 16 to day 17, there is a annual show you want to attend in Krakow.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nNice and Riga, Bucharest and Munich, Mykonos and Munich, Riga and Bucharest, Rome and Nice, Rome and Munich, Mykonos and Nice, Rome and Mykonos, Munich and Krakow, Rome and Bucharest, Nice and Munich, from Riga to Munich, from Rome to Riga.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 17 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
