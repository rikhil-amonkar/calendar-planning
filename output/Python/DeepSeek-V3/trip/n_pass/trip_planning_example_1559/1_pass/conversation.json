You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Valencia for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Valencia between day 3 and day 4 to tour together. You plan to stay in Oslo for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Oslo between day 13 and day 15. You would like to visit Lyon for 4 days. You would like to visit Prague for 3 days. You plan to stay in Paris for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Nice. You plan to stay in Seville for 5 days. From day 5 to day 9, there is a annual show you want to attend in Seville. You want to spend 2 days in Tallinn. You plan to stay in Mykonos for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Mykonos between day 21 and day 25. You would like to visit Lisbon for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLisbon and Paris, Lyon and Nice, Tallinn and Oslo, Prague and Lyon, Paris and Oslo, Lisbon and Seville, Prague and Lisbon, Oslo and Nice, Valencia and Paris, Valencia and Lisbon, Paris and Nice, Nice and Mykonos, Paris and Lyon, Valencia and Lyon, Prague and Oslo, Prague and Paris, Seville and Paris, Oslo and Lyon, Prague and Valencia, Lisbon and Nice, Lisbon and Oslo, Valencia and Seville, Lisbon and Lyon, Paris and Tallinn, Prague and Tallinn.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
