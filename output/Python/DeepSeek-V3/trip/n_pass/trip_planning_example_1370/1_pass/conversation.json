You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 5 days in Santorini. You would like to meet your friends at Santorini between day 25 and day 29 to tour together. You want to spend 5 days in Krakow. You are going to attend a wedding in Krakow between day 18 and day 22. You want to spend 5 days in Paris. You want to meet a friend in Paris between day 11 and day 15. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 3 days. You plan to stay in Munich for 5 days. You would like to visit Geneva for 2 days. You plan to stay in Amsterdam for 4 days. You want to spend 5 days in Budapest. You want to spend 4 days in Split.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nParis and Krakow, Paris and Amsterdam, Paris and Split, from Vilnius to Munich, Paris and Geneva, Amsterdam and Geneva, Munich and Split, Split and Krakow, Munich and Amsterdam, Budapest and Amsterdam, Split and Geneva, Vilnius and Split, Munich and Geneva, Munich and Krakow, from Krakow to Vilnius, Vilnius and Amsterdam, Budapest and Paris, Krakow and Amsterdam, Vilnius and Paris, Budapest and Geneva, Split and Amsterdam, Santorini and Geneva, Amsterdam and Santorini, Munich and Budapest, Munich and Paris.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 30 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
