You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 4 days in Salzburg. You want to spend 2 days in Stockholm. You would like to visit Venice for 5 days. From day 1 to day 5, there is a annual show you want to attend in Venice. You plan to stay in Frankfurt for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Florence. You plan to stay in Barcelona for 2 days. You would like to visit Stuttgart for 3 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBarcelona and Frankfurt, Florence and Frankfurt, Stockholm and Barcelona, Barcelona and Florence, Venice and Barcelona, Stuttgart and Barcelona, Frankfurt and Salzburg, Stockholm and Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Stockholm, Stuttgart and Frankfurt, Venice and Stuttgart, Venice and Frankfurt.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 18 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
