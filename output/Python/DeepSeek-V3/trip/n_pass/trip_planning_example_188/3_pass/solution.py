    # Brussels: Day 1-2 (2 full days)
    # Travel to Barcelona on Day 3 (counts as Barcelona day 1)
    # Barcelona: Day 3-9 (7 days total)
    #   - During this Barcelona stay, travel to Split on Day 7
    #   - Day 7 counts as both Barcelona day 5 and Split day 1
    # Split: Day 7-11 (5 days total)
    #   - Travel back to Barcelona on Day 11 (counts as Split day 5 and Barcelona day 6)
    # Barcelona: Day 11-12 (2 days - counts as Barcelona days 6-7)
    
    # Breakdown:
    # Brussels: Day 1-2 (2 days)
    # Barcelona: 
    #   - First stay: Day 3-6 (4 days)
    #   - Travel day to Split: Day 7 (Barcelona day 5)
    #   - After Split: Day 11-12 (2 days) + Day 11 counts as Barcelona day 6
    #   - Total Barcelona: 7 days (3-6,7,11-12)
    # Split: Day 7-11 (5 days)
