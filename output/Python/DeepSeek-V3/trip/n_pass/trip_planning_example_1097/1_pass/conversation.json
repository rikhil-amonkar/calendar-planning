You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 4 days. You want to spend 2 days in Riga. You want to meet a friend in Riga between day 4 and day 5. You plan to stay in Oslo for 3 days. You want to spend 5 days in Lyon. You want to spend 2 days in Dubrovnik. You are going to attend a wedding in Dubrovnik between day 7 and day 8. You want to spend 2 days in Madrid. You want to spend 4 days in Warsaw. You would like to visit London for 3 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nWarsaw and Reykjavik, Oslo and Madrid, Warsaw and Riga, Lyon and London, Madrid and London, Warsaw and London, from Reykjavik to Madrid, Warsaw and Oslo, Oslo and Dubrovnik, Oslo and Reykjavik, Riga and Oslo, Oslo and Lyon, Oslo and London, London and Reykjavik, Warsaw and Madrid, Madrid and Lyon, Dubrovnik and Madrid.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 18 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
