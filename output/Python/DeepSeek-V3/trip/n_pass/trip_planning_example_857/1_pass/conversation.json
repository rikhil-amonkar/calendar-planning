You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Porto for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Geneva. You want to spend 3 days in Mykonos. You want to meet a friend in Mykonos between day 10 and day 12. You would like to visit Manchester for 4 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Manchester between day 15 and day 18. You would like to visit Hamburg for 5 days. You would like to visit Naples for 5 days. You plan to stay in Frankfurt for 2 days. From day 5 to day 6, there is a annual show you want to attend in Frankfurt.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nHamburg and Frankfurt, Naples and Mykonos, Hamburg and Porto, from Hamburg to Geneva, Mykonos and Geneva, Frankfurt and Geneva, Frankfurt and Porto, Geneva and Porto, Geneva and Manchester, Naples and Manchester, Frankfurt and Naples, Frankfurt and Manchester, Naples and Geneva, Porto and Manchester, Hamburg and Manchester.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 18 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
