You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Dublin for 5 days. From day 11 to day 15, there is a annual show you want to attend in Dublin. You want to spend 4 days in Krakow. You plan to stay in Istanbul for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Istanbul between day 9 and day 11. You would like to visit Venice for 3 days. You would like to visit Naples for 4 days. You want to spend 2 days in Brussels. You want to spend 4 days in Mykonos. You plan to visit relatives in Mykonos between day 1 and day 4. You plan to stay in Frankfurt for 3 days. You would like to meet your friends at Frankfurt between day 15 and day 17 to tour together.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nDublin and Brussels, Mykonos and Naples, Venice and Istanbul, Frankfurt and Krakow, Naples and Dublin, Krakow and Brussels, Naples and Istanbul, Naples and Brussels, Istanbul and Frankfurt, from Brussels to Frankfurt, Istanbul and Krakow, Istanbul and Brussels, Venice and Frankfurt, Naples and Frankfurt, Dublin and Krakow, Venice and Brussels, Naples and Venice, Istanbul and Dublin, Venice and Dublin, Dublin and Frankfurt.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 21 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
