You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 2 days in Lisbon. You have to attend a workshop in Lisbon between day 4 and day 5. You want to spend 5 days in Dubrovnik. You want to spend 5 days in Copenhagen. You plan to stay in Prague for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Tallinn. You want to meet a friend in Tallinn between day 1 and day 2. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 4 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Stockholm between day 13 and day 16. You plan to stay in Split for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Lyon. From day 18 to day 19, there is a annual show you want to attend in Lyon.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nDubrovnik and Stockholm, Lisbon and Copenhagen, Lisbon and Lyon, Copenhagen and Stockholm, Copenhagen and Split, Prague and Stockholm, Tallinn and Stockholm, Prague and Lyon, Lisbon and Stockholm, Prague and Lisbon, Stockholm and Split, Prague and Copenhagen, Split and Lyon, Copenhagen and Dubrovnik, Prague and Split, Tallinn and Copenhagen, Tallinn and Prague.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 19 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above trip constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal itinerary using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nExample structure of output from running code: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\nNote that the JSON structure should be what the Python program outputs, not just a string representation.\n4. Note that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nThe program must include:\n- Actual calculations to determine durations and transitions\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
