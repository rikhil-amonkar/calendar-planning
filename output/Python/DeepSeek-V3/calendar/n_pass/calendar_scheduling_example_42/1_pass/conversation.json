In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Julie, Sean and Lori for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJulie has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \nSean has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nLori is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."
