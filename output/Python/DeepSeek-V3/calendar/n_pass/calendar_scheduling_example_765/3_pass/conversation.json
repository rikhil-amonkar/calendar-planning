        "content": "You are an expert at scheduling meetings. Your task is to find a suitable time for a meeting based on the participants' schedules and constraints. In this case:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Joshua and Joyce for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJoshua has meetings on Monday during 15:00 to 15:30, Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nJoyce is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nJoyce would rather not meet on Monday before 12:00. Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nGenerate a fully working Python script with code that calculates a proposed time and outputs it in the format HH:MM:HH:MM. The script should also output the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). The script should be clean, well-formatted, and enclosed within ```python and ```. The output of the generated code must include both the time range (like {14:30:15:30}) and the day of the week. Provide the response with only code."

Updated Joyce's Monday availability to reflect that she's completely unavailable from 0:00 to 12:00 (changed from the previous partial availability)\n2. Added additional checks to ensure meeting times respect Joyce's preference (meeting_start >= day_start)\n3. The code will now properly avoid scheduling any meetings before 12:00 on Monday\n\nThe output should now find a valid meeting time that doesn't conflict with Joyce's unavailability before 12:00 on Monday. The next available slot would be Wednesday at 11:00-11:30 (assuming the other constraints remain the same)."

Updated Joyce's Monday availability to correctly reflect she's unavailable until 12:30 (changed from `(0, 12*60)` to `(0, 12*60 + 30)`)\n2. The rest of the logic remains the same, but now it will properly avoid scheduling during Joyce's unavailable time\n\nThe code will now look for available slots after 12:30 on Monday, considering all constraints. The next available slot on Monday would be after Joyce's last busy period ends at 15:00 (3:00 PM), but that conflicts with Joshua's busy time from 15:00-15:30. The next available time would be at 15:30-16:00.\n\nThe output should now be:\n```\nMonday: 15:30:16:00\n```"
