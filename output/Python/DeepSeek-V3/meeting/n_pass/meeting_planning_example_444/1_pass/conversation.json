Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFinancial District to Russian Hill: 10.\nFinancial District to Sunset District: 31.\nFinancial District to North Beach: 7.\nFinancial District to The Castro: 23.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nRussian Hill to Financial District: 11.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to North Beach: 5.\nRussian Hill to The Castro: 21.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\nSunset District to Financial District: 30.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to North Beach: 29.\nSunset District to The Castro: 17.\nSunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nNorth Beach to Financial District: 8.\nNorth Beach to Russian Hill: 4.\nNorth Beach to Sunset District: 27.\nNorth Beach to The Castro: 22.\nNorth Beach to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nThe Castro to Financial District: 20.\nThe Castro to Russian Hill: 18.\nThe Castro to Sunset District: 17.\nThe Castro to North Beach: 20.\nThe Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nGolden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to North Beach: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to The Castro: 13.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Financial District at 9:00AM. Ronald will be at Russian Hill from 1:45PM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 105 minutes. Patricia will be at Sunset District from 9:15AM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 60 minutes. Laura will be at North Beach from 12:30PM to 12:45PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 15 minutes. Emily will be at The Castro from 4:15PM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 60 minutes. Mary will be at Golden Gate Park from 3:00PM to 4:30PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
