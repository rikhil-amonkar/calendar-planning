Brian will be at North Beach from 1:00PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 90 minutes. Richard will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 11:00AM to 12:45PM. You'd like to meet Richard for a minimum of 60 minutes. Ashley will be at Haight-Ashbury from 3:00PM to 8:30PM. You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 90 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Nob Hill from 11:45AM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 75 minutes. Jessica will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:00PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 105 minutes. Deborah will be at Union Square from 5:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 60 minutes. Kimberly will be at Alamo Square from 5:30PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 45 minutes. Matthew will be at Presidio from 8:15AM to 9:00AM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 15 minutes. Kenneth will be at Chinatown from 1:45PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 105 minutes. Anthony will be at Pacific Heights from 2:15PM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
