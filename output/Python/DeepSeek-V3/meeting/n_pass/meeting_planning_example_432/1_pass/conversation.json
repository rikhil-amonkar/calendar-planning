Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nGolden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to Bayview: 23.\nGolden Gate Park to Mission District: 17.\nGolden Gate Park to Embarcadero: 25.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Mission District: 22.\nFisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero: 8.\nFisherman's Wharf to Financial District: 11.\nBayview to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\nBayview to Mission District: 13.\nBayview to Embarcadero: 19.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nMission District to Golden Gate Park: 17.\nMission District to Fisherman's Wharf: 22.\nMission District to Bayview: 15.\nMission District to Embarcadero: 19.\nMission District to Financial District: 17.\nEmbarcadero to Golden Gate Park: 25.\nEmbarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf: 6.\nEmbarcadero to Bayview: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Mission District: 20.\nEmbarcadero to Financial District: 5.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nFinancial District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Mission District: 17.\nFinancial District to Embarcadero: 4.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00AM. Joseph will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00AM to 5:30PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Bayview from 5:30PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 60 minutes. Kevin will be at Mission District from 11:15AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 30 minutes. David will be at Embarcadero from 8:15AM to 9:00AM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 30 minutes. Barbara will be at Financial District from 10:30AM to 4:30PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
