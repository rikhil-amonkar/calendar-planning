Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nRichmond District to Marina District: 9.\nRichmond District to Chinatown: 20.\nRichmond District to Financial District: 22.\nRichmond District to Bayview: 26.\nRichmond District to Union Square: 21.\nMarina District to Richmond District: 11.\nMarina District to Chinatown: 16.\nMarina District to Financial District: 17.\nMarina District to Bayview: 27.\nMarina District to Union Square: 16.\nChinatown to Richmond District: 20.\nChinatown to Marina District: 12.\nChinatown to Financial District: 5.\nChinatown to Bayview: 22.\nChinatown to Union Square: 7.\nFinancial District to Richmond District: 21.\nFinancial District to Marina District: 15.\nFinancial District to Chinatown: 5.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Union Square: 9.\nBayview to Richmond District: 25.\nBayview to Marina District: 25.\nBayview to Chinatown: 18.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nBayview to Union Square: 17.\nUnion Square to Richmond District: 20.\nUnion Square to Marina District: 18.\nUnion Square to Chinatown: 7.\nUnion Square to Financial District: 9.\nUnion Square to Bayview: 15.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Richmond District at 9:00AM. Kimberly will be at Marina District from 1:15PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 15 minutes. Robert will be at Chinatown from 12:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 15 minutes. Rebecca will be at Financial District from 1:15PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 75 minutes. Margaret will be at Bayview from 9:30AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 30 minutes. Kenneth will be at Union Square from 7:30PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
