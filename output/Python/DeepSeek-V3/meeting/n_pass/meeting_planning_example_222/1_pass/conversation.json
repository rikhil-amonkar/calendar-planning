Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNob Hill to North Beach: 8.\nNob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf: 11.\nNob Hill to Bayview: 19.\nNorth Beach to Nob Hill: 7.\nNorth Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: 5.\nNorth Beach to Bayview: 22.\nFisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill: 11.\nFisherman's Wharf to North Beach: 6.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nBayview to Nob Hill: 20.\nBayview to North Beach: 21.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00AM. Helen will be at North Beach from 7:00AM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Kimberly will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:30PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 45 minutes. Patricia will be at Bayview from 6:00PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
