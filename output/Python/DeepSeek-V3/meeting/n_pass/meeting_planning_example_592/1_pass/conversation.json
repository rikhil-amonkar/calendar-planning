Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNorth Beach to Pacific Heights: 8.\nNorth Beach to Chinatown: 6.\nNorth Beach to Union Square: 7.\nNorth Beach to Mission District: 18.\nNorth Beach to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nNorth Beach to Nob Hill: 7.\nPacific Heights to North Beach: 9.\nPacific Heights to Chinatown: 11.\nPacific Heights to Union Square: 12.\nPacific Heights to Mission District: 15.\nPacific Heights to Golden Gate Park: 15.\nPacific Heights to Nob Hill: 8.\nChinatown to North Beach: 3.\nChinatown to Pacific Heights: 10.\nChinatown to Union Square: 7.\nChinatown to Mission District: 18.\nChinatown to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nChinatown to Nob Hill: 8.\nUnion Square to North Beach: 10.\nUnion Square to Pacific Heights: 15.\nUnion Square to Chinatown: 7.\nUnion Square to Mission District: 14.\nUnion Square to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nUnion Square to Nob Hill: 9.\nMission District to North Beach: 17.\nMission District to Pacific Heights: 16.\nMission District to Chinatown: 16.\nMission District to Union Square: 15.\nMission District to Golden Gate Park: 17.\nMission District to Nob Hill: 12.\nGolden Gate Park to North Beach: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to Pacific Heights: 16.\nGolden Gate Park to Chinatown: 23.\nGolden Gate Park to Union Square: 22.\nGolden Gate Park to Mission District: 17.\nGolden Gate Park to Nob Hill: 20.\nNob Hill to North Beach: 8.\nNob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8.\nNob Hill to Chinatown: 6.\nNob Hill to Union Square: 7.\nNob Hill to Mission District: 13.\nNob Hill to Golden Gate Park: 17.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at North Beach at 9:00AM. James will be at Pacific Heights from 8:00PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet James for a minimum of 120 minutes. Robert will be at Chinatown from 12:15PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Union Square from 9:30AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 120 minutes. Carol will be at Mission District from 6:15PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 15 minutes. Mark will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:30AM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 15 minutes. Sandra will be at Nob Hill from 8:00AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
