Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nHaight-Ashbury to Russian Hill: 17.\nHaight-Ashbury to Fisherman's Wharf: 23.\nHaight-Ashbury to Nob Hill: 15.\nHaight-Ashbury to Golden Gate Park: 7.\nHaight-Ashbury to Alamo Square: 5.\nHaight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights: 12.\nRussian Hill to Haight-Ashbury: 17.\nRussian Hill to Fisherman's Wharf: 7.\nRussian Hill to Nob Hill: 5.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\nRussian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\nRussian Hill to Pacific Heights: 7.\nFisherman's Wharf to Haight-Ashbury: 22.\nFisherman's Wharf to Russian Hill: 7.\nFisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill: 11.\nFisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25.\nFisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square: 20.\nFisherman's Wharf to Pacific Heights: 12.\nNob Hill to Haight-Ashbury: 13.\nNob Hill to Russian Hill: 5.\nNob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf: 11.\nNob Hill to Golden Gate Park: 17.\nNob Hill to Alamo Square: 11.\nNob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8.\nGolden Gate Park to Haight-Ashbury: 7.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nGolden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to Nob Hill: 20.\nGolden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Pacific Heights: 16.\nAlamo Square to Haight-Ashbury: 5.\nAlamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nAlamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf: 19.\nAlamo Square to Nob Hill: 11.\nAlamo Square to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nAlamo Square to Pacific Heights: 10.\nPacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury: 11.\nPacific Heights to Russian Hill: 7.\nPacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf: 13.\nPacific Heights to Nob Hill: 8.\nPacific Heights to Golden Gate Park: 15.\nPacific Heights to Alamo Square: 10.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00AM. Stephanie will be at Russian Hill from 8:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 15 minutes. Kevin will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 7:15PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 75 minutes. Robert will be at Nob Hill from 7:45AM to 10:30AM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 90 minutes. Steven will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:30AM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 75 minutes. Anthony will be at Alamo Square from 7:45AM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 15 minutes. Sandra will be at Pacific Heights from 2:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
