Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nSunset District to Alamo Square: 17.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nSunset District to Mission District: 24.\nAlamo Square to Sunset District: 16.\nAlamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nAlamo Square to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nAlamo Square to Mission District: 10.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\nRussian Hill to Mission District: 16.\nGolden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nGolden Gate Park to Mission District: 17.\nMission District to Sunset District: 24.\nMission District to Alamo Square: 11.\nMission District to Russian Hill: 15.\nMission District to Golden Gate Park: 17.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM. Charles will be at Alamo Square from 6:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 90 minutes. Margaret will be at Russian Hill from 9:00AM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 30 minutes. Daniel will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:00AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 15 minutes. Stephanie will be at Mission District from 8:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
