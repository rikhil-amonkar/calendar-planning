Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25.\nFisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill: 11.\nFisherman's Wharf to Marina District: 9.\nFisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero: 8.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\nBayview to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nBayview to Nob Hill: 20.\nBayview to Marina District: 25.\nBayview to Embarcadero: 19.\nGolden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to Bayview: 23.\nGolden Gate Park to Nob Hill: 20.\nGolden Gate Park to Marina District: 16.\nGolden Gate Park to Embarcadero: 25.\nNob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf: 11.\nNob Hill to Bayview: 19.\nNob Hill to Golden Gate Park: 17.\nNob Hill to Marina District: 11.\nNob Hill to Embarcadero: 9.\nMarina District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10.\nMarina District to Bayview: 27.\nMarina District to Golden Gate Park: 18.\nMarina District to Nob Hill: 12.\nMarina District to Embarcadero: 14.\nEmbarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf: 6.\nEmbarcadero to Bayview: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Golden Gate Park: 25.\nEmbarcadero to Nob Hill: 10.\nEmbarcadero to Marina District: 12.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00AM. Thomas will be at Bayview from 3:30PM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Thomas for a minimum of 120 minutes. Stephanie will be at Golden Gate Park from 6:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 30 minutes. Laura will be at Nob Hill from 8:45AM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 30 minutes. Betty will be at Marina District from 6:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 45 minutes. Patricia will be at Embarcadero from 5:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
