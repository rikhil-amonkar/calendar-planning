Your task is to write a Python program that algorithmically calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the participants' constraints.\nThe program must actually compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer.\nInput parameters:\nYou are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nBayview to Russian Hill: 23.\nBayview to Alamo Square: 16.\nBayview to North Beach: 21.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nRussian Hill to Bayview: 23.\nRussian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\nRussian Hill to North Beach: 5.\nRussian Hill to Financial District: 11.\nAlamo Square to Bayview: 16.\nAlamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nAlamo Square to North Beach: 15.\nAlamo Square to Financial District: 17.\nNorth Beach to Bayview: 22.\nNorth Beach to Russian Hill: 4.\nNorth Beach to Alamo Square: 16.\nNorth Beach to Financial District: 8.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Russian Hill: 10.\nFinancial District to Alamo Square: 17.\nFinancial District to North Beach: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Joseph will be at Russian Hill from 8:30AM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 60 minutes. Nancy will be at Alamo Square from 11:00AM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jason will be at North Beach from 4:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 15 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Financial District from 10:30AM to 3:45PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nGenerate a complete, self-contained Python program that:\n1. Takes the above meeting constraints as input variables\n2. Computes the optimal meeting schedule using logical rules and calculations\n3. Outputs the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nRules for the program:\n- Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero)\n- The schedule must account for all travel times and constraints\n- The program must actually compute the schedule, not just print a static answer\n\nOutput only the complete Python code with no additional text or explanation.\nThe code must run independently and output valid JSON when executed."
