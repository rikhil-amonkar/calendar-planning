# We are given 8 European cities with required durations and specific event-date constraints.
# The cities and required durations (in days) are:
#    Istanbul: 5 days (and must be in Istanbul to attend an annual show from day 1 to day 5)
#    Dubrovnik: 2 days (and must be visited adjacent to a city that connects by flight; note Dubrovnik connects directly with Istanbul, Helsinki, and Frankfurt)
#    Helsinki: 3 days (desired visit)
#    Brussels: 3 days (required visit)
#    Milan: 4 days (required visit)
#    Split: 4 days (desired visit)
#    Frankfurt: 3 days (and wedding event must fall between day 16 and day 18, so Frankfurt’s days must include some day between 16 and 18)
#    Vilnius: 5 days (and a workshop must be scheduled between day 18 and day 22)

# Direct flight connections (assumed bidirectional unless indicated):
# Milan <-> Frankfurt
# Split <-> Frankfurt
# Milan <-> Split
# Brussels <-> Vilnius
# Brussels <-> Helsinki
# Istanbul <-> Brussels
# Milan <-> Vilnius
# Brussels <-> Milan
# Istanbul <-> Helsinki
# Helsinki <-> Vilnius
# Helsinki <-> Dubrovnik
# Split <-> Vilnius
# Dubrovnik <-> Istanbul  # given as "from Dubrovnik to Istanbul", assume connection works both ways for planning
# Istanbul <-> Milan
# Helsinki <-> Frankfurt
# Istanbul <-> Vilnius
# Split <-> Helsinki
# Milan <-> Helsinki
# Istanbul <-> Frankfurt
# Brussels <-> Frankfurt   # given as "from Brussels to Frankfurt"
# Dubrovnik <-> Frankfurt
# Frankfurt <-> Vilnius

# After experimenting with various orders we found an itinerary that meets the following conditions:
#   – Total distinct days = (sum of durations) – (# flights) = (5+2+3+3+4+4+3+5) - 7 = 29 - 7 = 22 days.
#   – Istanbul is first (days 1-5) so the annual show is attended.
#   – For the wedding in Frankfurt to occur between day 16 and day18, we must schedule Frankfurt so that its period falls in part into that window.
#   – For the Vilnius workshop, Vilnius must cover between day 18 and day22.
#
# We choose the following order (which obeys available direct flight connections):
#   1. Istanbul (5 days)
#   2. Dubrovnik (2 days) -- chosen to use the Helsinki <-> Dubrovnik connection possibility.
#   3. Helsinki (3 days)
#   4. Brussels (3 days)
#   5. Milan (4 days)
#   6. Split (4 days)
#   7. Frankfurt (3 days)   -- scheduled so that its period falls between day 16 and 18.
#   8. Vilnius (5 days)      -- workshop fits in the final period.
#
# Now we assign day ranges with the rule:
#    If you take a direct flight on day X from city A to city B,
#    then city A and city B both count day X.
#
# We design the itinerary so that the flight day is the last day of the previous city,
# and the same day is the first day for the next city.
#
# The planned day ranges:
#   Istanbul: days 1 to 5 (5 days)
#     (Flight to Dubrovnik on day 5)
#   Dubrovnik: days 5 to 6 (2 days: days 5 and 6)
#     (Flight to Helsinki on day 6)
#   Helsinki: days 6 to 8 (3 days: days 6, 7, and 8)
#     (Flight to Brussels on day 8)
#   Brussels: days 8 to 10 (3 days: days 8, 9, and 10)
#     (Flight to Milan on day 10)
#   Milan: days 10 to 13 (4 days: days 10, 11, 12, and 13)
#     (Flight to Split on day 13)
#   Split: days 13 to 16 (4 days: days 13, 14, 15, and 16)
#     (Flight to Frankfurt on day 16)
#   Frankfurt: days 16 to 18 (3 days: days 16, 17, and 18)
#     (Wedding in Frankfurt falls between day 16 and day 18)
#     (Flight to Vilnius on day 18)
#   Vilnius: days 18 to 22 (5 days: days 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22)
#     (Workshop in Vilnius is between day 18 and day 22)
#
# Check: Total distinct trip days = 22.

#   Istanbul -> Dubrovnik: available via Dubrovnik <-> Istanbul.
#   Dubrovnik -> Helsinki: available (Helsinki and Dubrovnik).
#   Helsinki -> Brussels: available.
