# We are given a trip with 10 cities and 28 total days.
# Each city visit is defined by its required number of days.
# Note: When flying on a day, that day counts as spending time in both the departure city and the arrival city.
# Thus, an itinerary with cities c1, c2, …, cN with required durations d1, d2, …, dN fits exactly in T = (sum(di) - (N - 1)) days.
#
# The problem also gives time‐window constraints:
# • Prague: exactly 5 days.
# • Riga: exactly 4 days; and an annual show in Riga must be attended from day 5 to day 8. (Thus Riga’s interval must cover days 5..8)
# • Lisbon: exactly 5 days.
# • Naples: exactly 5 days.
# • Warsaw: exactly 2 days.
# • Tallinn: exactly 3 days and must include a day between day 18 and day 20 (so that a relative visit is met).
# • Stockholm: exactly 2 days.
# • Santorini: exactly 5 days.
# • Milan: exactly 3 days and must include a day between day 24 and day 26 (to meet a friend).
# • Porto: exactly 3 days.
#
# In addition, the flight connectivity is only allowed along certain direct routes.
# After some trial and error, one ordering that satisfies all constraints and connectivity is chosen as follows:
#
# Order (with city durations in parentheses and computed day intervals):
#   1. Prague (5 days)      : [1, 5]
#   2. Riga (4 days)        : [5, 8]
#      -- Riga has a direct link with Prague.
#   3. Lisbon (5 days)      : [8, 12]
#      -- Lisbon<->Riga exists.
#   4. Naples (5 days)      : [12, 16]
#      -- Lisbon and Naples are connected.
#   5. Warsaw (2 days)      : [16, 17]
#      -- Naples and Warsaw are connected.
#   6. Tallinn (3 days)     : [17, 19]
#      -- Warsaw and Tallinn are connected.
#      This interval [17,19] includes day 18, fulfilling the relative-meeting constraint.
#   7. Stockholm (2 days)   : [19, 20]
#      -- Tallinn and Stockholm are connected.
#   8. Santorini (5 days)   : [20, 24]
#      -- There is a direct flight from Stockholm to Santorini.
#   9. Milan (3 days)       : [24, 26]
#      -- Santorini and Milan are connected.
#      Milan's interval [24,26] includes day 24 (or 25) fulfilling the friend-meeting window.
#  10. Porto (3 days)       : [26, 28]
#      -- Milan and Porto are connected.
#
# Total required days = 5+4+5+5+2+3+2+5+3+3 = 37.
# There are 9 flight overlaps so the itinerary length is 37 - 9 = 28 days.
#
# We output only the day_range and the place for each city visit in JSON.
#
# Construct the itinerary segments:
# Each segment will be a dictionary with two keys: "day_range" and "place".
# The day_range is a string like "start-end".
# Compute the start day for the 1st city as 1.
# For each subsequent city, the start day is equal to the previous city's end day.
# The end day for a city with duration d starting at s is: s + d - 1.
#
# Use the chosen ordering from above:
