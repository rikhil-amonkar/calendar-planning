    # Constraints:
    # - Helsinki workshop must be attended between day 1 and day 2 -> Helsinki must be the first city.
    # - Reykjavik friend meeting must occur between day 8 and day 9 -> Reykjavik's assigned day range must include one of those days.
    # - Warsaw relatives visit must occur between day 9 and day 11 -> Warsaw's assigned day range must cover part of that window.
    #
    # The trip must use only direct flights. Given the available direct flight connections, one valid ordering is:
    # [Helsinki, Madrid, Budapest, Reykjavik, Warsaw, Split]
    # Checking flights in this order:
    # Helsinki -> Madrid: direct (Helsinki and Madrid)
    # Madrid -> Budapest: direct (Madrid and Budapest)
    # Budapest -> Reykjavik: direct (Budapest and Reykjavik)
    # Reykjavik -> Warsaw: direct (Reykjavik and Warsaw)
    # Warsaw -> Split: direct (Warsaw and Split)
    #
    # Now, these overlapping transitions are counted as:
    # If flying from city A to city B on day X, then day X is counted for both A and B.
    # Thus the effective unique day allocation = sum(durations) - (number of flight transitions)
    # = (2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 4) - 5 = 19 - 5 = 14, as required.
