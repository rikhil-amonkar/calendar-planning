# The rule for overlaps is: if you fly on day X from city A to city B,
# then day X is counted for both A and B.
# We want the total trip (calendar days) to be 28.
# Using a recurrence relation: for the first city, start on day 1.
# For each subsequent city, we assume the flight happens on the start day,
# equal to the previous segment's end day.
#
# Thus, if a segment’s required duration is D, then if it starts on S,
# it occupies days S through S + D - 1.
# For the next segment, the start day is set equal to the previous segment's end day.
#
# Without adjustments, the overall calendar length will be:
#   Total = (sum of durations) - (number_of_transitions)
# For our segments: sum_durations = 3+5+2+5+5+5+2+4+2+4 = 37
# and number_of_transitions = 9, giving 37 - 9 = 28 days.
