    # We aim to find an itinerary that satisfies the following constraints:
    # 1. The wedding in Reykjavik must fall between day 9 and day 10.
    # 2. The annual show in Dublin is from day 2 to day 6.
    # 3. Meeting friends in Hamburg is between day 1 and day 2.
    # 4. Each flight day counts as a day in both the departure and arrival cities.
    # 5. The itinerary includes the cities in an order that is supported by direct flights.
    
    # Based on the constraints and direct flights, one workable itinerary is:
    # Segment 1: Hamburg for 2 days (day 1-2); flight from Hamburg -> Dublin on day 2 (overlap).
    # Segment 2: Dublin for 5 days (day 2-6); the annual show is attended during these days.
    # Segment 3: Helsinki for 4 days (day 6-9); flight from Dublin -> Helsinki on day 6.
    # Segment 4: Reykjavik for 2 days (day 9-10); flight from Helsinki -> Reykjavik on day 9.
    #           (Wedding will be attended on day 9 or 10 while in Reykjavik.)
    # Segment 5: London for 5 days (day 10-14); flight from Reykjavik -> London on day 10.
    # Segment 6: Mykonos for 3 days (day 14-16); flight from London -> Mykonos on day 14.

    # Hamburg -> Dublin is valid.
    # Dublin -> Helsinki is valid.
    # Helsinki -> Reykjavik is valid.
