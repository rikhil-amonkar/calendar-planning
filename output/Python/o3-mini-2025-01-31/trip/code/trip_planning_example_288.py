    # Check: The given flights in the problem are:
    # Vienna <-> Stuttgart, Manchester <-> Vienna, Madrid <-> Vienna, Manchester <-> Stuttgart,
    # Manchester <-> Madrid.
    # Our direct_flights dictionary is consistent with these constraints.
    
    # The itinerary must obey two date-specific constraints:
    # 1. Wedding in Manchester between day 1 and day 7.
    # 2. Workshop in Stuttgart between day 11 and day 15.
    # Also note, if you fly on day X, that day counts for both cities.
    #
    # We choose the following sequence of cities:
    # Start: Manchester (to attend the wedding and complete 7 days)
    # Then: Madrid (4 days) - using the direct flight Manchester <-> Madrid.
    # Then: Vienna (2 days) - direct flight Madrid <-> Vienna.
    # Finally: Stuttgart (5 days) - direct flight Vienna <-> Stuttgart.
    #
    # We plan the trip as:
    # Manchester: Days 1 to 7
    # Madrid: Flight from Manchester to Madrid on day 7; hence Madrid from day 7 to 10 (4 days)
    # Vienna: Flight from Madrid to Vienna on day 10; hence Vienna from day 10 to 11 (2 days)
    # Stuttgart: Flight from Vienna to Stuttgart on day 11; hence Stuttgart from day 11 to 15 (5 days)
    #
    # Verify flight connections:
    #   Manchester -> Madrid: available direct.
    #   Madrid -> Vienna: available direct.
    #   Vienna -> Stuttgart: available direct.
    #
    # Verify day overlaps:
    #   - Day 7 counts for both Manchester and Madrid.
    #   - Day 10 counts for both Madrid and Vienna.
    #   - Day 11 counts for both Vienna and Stuttgart.
    #
    # The actual days in which the participant is in a city (by flight rule):
    # Manchester: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7   (7 days)
    # Madrid: 7,8,9,10            (4 days)
    # Vienna: 10,11              (2 days)
    # Stuttgart: 11,12,13,14,15   (5 days)
    #
    # Total distinct days: 1...15
    #
    # Additionally, note the workshop in Stuttgart (days 11-15) and the wedding in Manchester 
    # (days 1-7) are within the respective intervals.
