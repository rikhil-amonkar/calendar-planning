# Explanation/Logic of chosen itinerary:
# We note the following constraints:
# 1. Wedding in Manchester between day 1 and day 3. We choose to start in Manchester.
# 2. Need 3 days (with possible flight on boundary day).
# 3. Venice workshop must occur between day 3 and day 9, and Venice needs 7 days.
# 4. Other cities (Lyon, Istanbul, Krakow) have fixed required days.
# Also, when flying on a day, that day counts in both the departure and arrival cities.
#
# We choose the following ordering:
#   Start: Manchester (days 1 - 3) with wedding in the window.
#   Then fly from Manchester to Venice on day 3 (so day 3 belongs to both Manchester and Venice).
#   Stay in Venice from day 3 to day 9 (7 days total, workshop window covered).
#   Then fly from Venice to Lyon on day 9 (overlap day 9 for both Venice and Lyon).
#   Stay in Lyon on days 9 and 10 to get 2 days total.
#   Then fly from Lyon to Istanbul on day 10 (overlap day 10 for both Lyon and Istanbul).
#   Stay in Istanbul from day 10 to day 16 (7 days total).
#   Finally, fly from Istanbul to Krakow on day 16 (overlap day 16 for both Istanbul and Krakow).
#   Stay in Krakow from day 16 to day 21 (6 days total).
#
# Verify that each flight is available via direct flights:
#  - Manchester -> Venice is available.
#  - Venice -> Lyon is available.
#  - Lyon -> Istanbul is available.
#  - Istanbul -> Krakow is available.
#
# Calculate the itinerary segments with effective day ranges.
# Note: When a flight happens on a boundary day, that day counts for both cities.
#
# Days spent computation:
#  Manchester: Days 1, 2, 3    -> 3 days valid (wedding between day 1 and day 3 confirmed)
#  Venice: Days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9    -> 7 days valid (workshop can be attended between day 3 and 9)
#  Lyon: Days 9, 10    -> 2 days valid
#  Istanbul: Days 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16    -> 7 days valid
#  Krakow: Days 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21    -> 6 days valid
#
# Total days from 1 to 21 = 21 days.

# Build the itinerary as a list of segments. Each segment is represented as a dictionary with "day_range" and "place".
