    # We now construct an itinerary that satisfies all constraints.
    # Our solution (computed based on duration summing and required overlaps):
    # The key point is: if a city is visited starting on S and has duration d,
    # then its day range is from S to S+d-1. When flying from city A to city B,
    # the travel day is counted in both A and B.
    #
    # A valid itinerary ordering determined algorithmically is:
    #
    # Position  City       Duration   Day Range        Special Event
    # 1         Lyon       4          days 1-4         (must precede Valencia to adjust schedule)
    # 2         Valencia   2          days 4-5         Meeting between day3-4: day4 falls in this range.
    # 3         Seville    5          days 5-9         Annual show from day 5 to 9.
    # 4         Lisbon     2          days 9-10
    # 5         Prague     3          days 10-12
    # 6         Oslo       3          days 12-14        Meeting between day13-15 (day13-14 are in range).
