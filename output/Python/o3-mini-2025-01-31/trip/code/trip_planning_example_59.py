    # Available direct flights:
    # Bucharest <-> Lyon, Lyon <-> Porto
    
    # Additional constraint:
    # - There is a wedding in Bucharest between day 1 and day 7, so one must be in Bucharest
    #   during that period.
    # - Note: if one flies from a city A to city B on a day, that day counts as a day in both A and B.
    #
    # We have three cities to visit:
    #   Bucharest, Lyon, and Porto.
    # With 2 flights (transitions), the overlapping days count for both cities.
    # Let the flight from Bucharest to Lyon be on day f1 and the flight from Lyon to Porto be on day f2.
    #
    # The days spent in each city are:
    #   Bucharest: days 1 to f1 (inclusive)   -> count = f1
    #   Lyon: day f1 (arrival day) + full days from (f1+1) to (f2-1) + day f2 (departure day)
    #         -> count = 1 + (f2 - f1 - 1) + 1 = f2 - f1 + 1
    #   Porto: day f2 (arrival day) + days (f2+1) to total_days
    #         -> count = 1 + (total_days - f2)
    #
    # We want:
    #   f1 = days_in_bucharest = 7  (so that days 1-7 cover Bucharest,
    #       ensuring the wedding is attended in the first 7 days)
    #
    #   For Lyon: f2 - f1 + 1 = days_in_lyon = 7
    #           => f2 - 7 + 1 = 7  -> f2 = 7 + 6 = 13
    #
    #   Then Porto: 1 + (total_days - f2) = 1 + (16 - 13) = 4 = days_in_porto
    #
    # This gives:
    flight_day_bucharest_to_lyon = 7  # f1
    flight_day_lyon_to_porto = 13      # f2

    # Building the itinerary:
    # The trip plan segments:
    # 1. Bucharest from day 1 to day 7 (day 7 is used for the flight and counts as Bucharest)
    # 2. Lyon from day 7 to day 13 (day 7 from arrival flight, day 13 for departure flight)
    # 3. Porto from day 13 to day 16 (day 13 counts as the arrival day)
