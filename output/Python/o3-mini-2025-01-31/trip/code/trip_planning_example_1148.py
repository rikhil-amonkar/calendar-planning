# We now compute a valid itinerary order that meets all constraints.
# From the constraints we note:
# - Tallinn must be visited on day 1-2 (friend meeting window) -> so it must be first.
# - Lisbon must host the workshop on day 4-5 -> Lisbon must be visited such that its day range 
#   covers day 4 or day 5.
# - Stockholm must cover day 13-16 (wedding) and Lyon must cover day 18-19 (annual show).
#
# One valid itinerary order found by logical deduction is:
# 1. Tallinn (2 days)  [days 1-2]
# 2. Prague (3 days)   [flight on day 2, itinerary day range 2-4]
# 3. Lisbon (2 days)   [flight on day 4, itinerary day range 4-5]
# 4. Copenhagen (5 days) [flight on day 5, itinerary day range 5-9]
# 5. Dubrovnik (5 days)  [flight on day 9, itinerary day range 9-13]
# 6. Stockholm (4 days)  [flight on day 13, itinerary day range 13-16]
# 7. Split (3 days)      [flight on day 16, itinerary day range 16-18]
# 8. Lyon (2 days)       [flight on day 18, itinerary day range 18-19]
#
