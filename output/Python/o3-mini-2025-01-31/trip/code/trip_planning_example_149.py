    # Conferences in Santorini occur on day 5 and day 10.
    # Direct flights available: Istanbul <-> London and London <-> Santorini.
    #
    # We use the following reasoning:
    # 1. Begin in Istanbul for the required 3 days.
    #    To get exactly 3 days in Istanbul, we set:
    #       Day 1: in Istanbul
    #       Day 2: stay in Istanbul
    #       Day 3: fly from Istanbul to London (thus day3 counts for both Istanbul and London).
    #    Istanbul total = days 1, 2, 3 (3 days).
    #
    # 2. Next, London must be visited for 3 days.
    #    Already on day3 (arrival day), we count London.
    #    To have 3 days for London, we use:
    #       Day 3: (overlap from flight arrival)
    #       Day 4: full day in London
    #       Day 5: fly from London to Santorini (day5 counts for both London and Santorini).
    #    London total = days 3, 4, 5 (3 days).
    #
    # 3. Finally, Santorini must be visited for 6 days.
    #    After arriving on day5, we plan Santorini from day5 to day10.
    #    This provides:
    #       Days 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 = 6 days (and day 5 and day 10 meet the conference obligations).
    #
    # The complete schedule (including overlaps) is:
    #   Istanbul: Days 1-3
    #   London: Days 3-5
    #   Santorini: Days 5-10
