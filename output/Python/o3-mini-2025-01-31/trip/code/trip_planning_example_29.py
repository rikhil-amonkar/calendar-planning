    dubrovnik_required = 7            # exactly 7 days in Dubrovnik
    frankfurt_required = 3            # exactly 3 days in Frankfurt

    # Flight connectivity:
    # Dubrovnik <--> Frankfurt and Frankfurt <--> Krakow are allowed.
    # To use the double counting rule for flights, if flight happens on day X,
    # the traveler is counted as being in both origin and destination on that day.
    
    # Our aim is to satisfy the following:
    #   - spend 7 days in Dubrovnik
    #   - spend 3 days in Frankfurt
    #   - spend 2 days in Krakow, with wedding in Krakow on day 9 and day 10
    # A feasible plan is:
    #   - Stay in Dubrovnik from day 1 to day 7.
    #     We take a flight from Dubrovnik to Frankfurt on day 7.
    #     (So day 7 is counted for both Dubrovnik and Frankfurt.)
    #   - Then remain in Frankfurt on day 8 and take a flight to Krakow on day 9.
    #     (So Frankfurt is counted on day 7, day 8, and day 9.)
    #   - Finally, finish in Krakow on day 9 (flight day counts for Krakow as well) and day 10.
    #
    # This yields:
    # Dubrovnik: days 1-7 (7 days)
    # Frankfurt: days 7-9 (3 days)
    # Krakow: days 9-10 (2 days, satisfying the wedding constraint)
