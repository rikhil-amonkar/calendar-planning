# We need an itinerary that visits all cities and satisfies constraints:
# Constraints:
# 1. Must visit Nice during days 1 to 5 (for a relative visit).
# 2. Must be in Frankfurt between day 19 and day 20 (to meet friends).
# 3. Total days count must be 20.
# The flight rule: if flying from A to B on day X, that day counts for both A and B.
#
# The raw durations per city sum to: 5 + 6 + 7 + 4 + 2 = 24 days.
# Since we have 5 cities, there will be 4 flights. Each flight day is double counted once.

#   Nice -> Lyon -> Dublin -> Krakow -> Frankfurt

#   Nice to Lyon: (Nice, Lyon) exists.
#   Lyon to Dublin: (Lyon, Dublin) exists.
#   Dublin to Krakow: (Dublin, Krakow) exists.
#   Krakow to Frankfurt: (Krakow, Frankfurt) exists.
#

# We assume that when departing from city1 and arriving city2,
# the last day of city1 is the same as the first day of city2.
