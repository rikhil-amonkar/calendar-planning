# We now assign day boundaries.
# Rule: When flying from city A to city B on a flight day, that day is counted in both A and B.
# Thus, for every transition except the beginning and end, we are double-counting one calendar day.
# Our chosen design:
#   For the first city, assign start_day = 1.
#   If a city is not the last in the order:
#       its effective days = [current_day] as full day(s) plus it shares a flight day for departure.
#       Thus, if req_days > 1 then: end_day = start_day + (req_days - 1)
#   For the last city, it only gets the arrival flight day (shared) plus one extra full day.
#   We'll use the following assignment based on our design:
#     Segment 1 (Krakow, req=2): from day 1 to day 2. (Day1 full, Day2 as flight day)
#     Segment 2 (Stuttgart, req=2): starts on day 2 (arrival) and continues through day 3,
#         so effective days: day2 and day3. (Wedding in Stuttgart on day2-3)
#     Segment 3 (Split, req=2): starts on day 3 and continues through day 4.
#         (Meeting friends in Split on day3-4)
#     Segment 4 (Prague, req=4): starts on day 4; if not last, it gets arrival day plus full days,
#         so Prague: day4 (arrival), then full days day5 and day6, and flight day day7 = 4 effective days.
#     Segment 5 (Florence, req=2): starts on day 7, then day8 full.
# This assignment uses calendar days 1...8.
