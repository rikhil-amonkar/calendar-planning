    # Remember: if you fly on day X, that day counts for both the city you left and the one you arrive.
    # So if durations sum to S, then S - (#flights) must equal total_trip_days.
    # Here S = 4 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 30, and 30 - 7 = 23.

    # The cities (with required durations) and special event constraints:
    # - Reykjavik: 4 days
    # - Stuttgart: 5 days
    # - Manchester: 5 days
    # - Istanbul: 2 days, and the annual show is from day 12 to day 13 (so this visit must cover these days)
    # - Bucharest: 4 days, with a workshop between day 16 and day 19 (so its visit must include one of these days)
    # - Riga: 4 days
    # - Vienna: 2 days
    # - Florence: 4 days
    #
    # Our chosen sequence is determined by checking the direct flight network.
    # Direct flight connections (bidirectional unless noted) include:
    #   Bucharest <-> Vienna, Reykjavik <-> Vienna, Manchester <-> Vienna, Manchester <-> Riga,
    #   Riga <-> Vienna, Istanbul <-> Vienna, Vienna <-> Florence, Stuttgart <-> Vienna,
    #   Riga <-> Bucharest, Istanbul <-> Riga, Stuttgart <-> Istanbul,
    #   from Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Istanbul <-> Bucharest, Manchester <-> Istanbul,
    #   Manchester <-> Bucharest, Stuttgart <-> Manchester.
    #
    # We choose a route that satisfies the constraints and uses exactly 7 flights:
    # The route: 
    #  1. Reykjavik (4 days)
    #  2. Stuttgart (5 days)
    #  3. Manchester (5 days)
    #  4. Istanbul (2 days) [must include days 12-13 for the annual show]
    #  5. Bucharest (4 days) [must include a day in [16,19] for the workshop]
    #  6. Riga (4 days)
    #  7. Vienna (2 days)
    #  8. Florence (4 days)
    #
    # Check flight connectivity for consecutive cities:
    #   Reykjavik -> Stuttgart: allowed because there is a direct flight from Reykjavik to Stuttgart.
    #   Stuttgart -> Manchester: allowed.
    #   Manchester -> Istanbul: allowed.
    #   Istanbul -> Bucharest: allowed.
    #   Bucharest -> Riga: allowed (connection exists between Riga and Bucharest).
    #   Riga -> Vienna: allowed.
    #   Vienna -> Florence: allowed.
    #
    # Now assign day intervals. The rule is:
    # For the first city, start_day = 1 and end_day = start_day + duration - 1.
    # For every subsequent city, the start_day is the previous city's end_day (since the flight day is shared)
    # and the end_day is start_day + duration - 1.
    #
    # This gives a total trip day count = sum(durations) - (number of flights)
