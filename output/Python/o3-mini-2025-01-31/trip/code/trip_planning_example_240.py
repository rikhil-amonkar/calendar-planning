# Important fixed events:

# - Visiting relatives in Tallinn must occur between day 8 and day 12

# Allowed direct flights (not used explicitly in computation, but they constrain the route):

# We design an itinerary based on the constraints and flight connections.
# We use the following leg ordering:
# Leg 1: Start in Prague fulfilling exactly 2 days.
#   To avoid adding extra days for Prague, we take the flight on a day that is already counted.
#   We'll fly on day 2 from Prague to Stockholm.
#
# Leg 2: Then continue in Stockholm. 
#   Flight from Prague to Stockholm on day 2 means day 2 counts for both Prague and Stockholm.
#   Then remain in Stockholm until it is time to leave for Berlin.
#   We take the flight from Stockholm to Berlin on day 6.
#   Thus Stockholm is present from day 2 through day 6.
#
# Leg 3: In Berlin for its required 3 days. 
#   With the flight from Stockholm to Berlin on day 6, Berlin is entered on day 6.
#   We then remain in Berlin on day 7,
#   and on day 8 we fly from Berlin to Tallinn. (Day 8 counts for both Berlin and Tallinn).
#   This gives Berlin days 6, 7, and 8 (with conferences on day 6 and day 8).
#
# Leg 4: Finally, finish in Tallinn for the last part.
#   After arriving to Tallinn on day 8, we remain in Tallinn from day 8 to day 12.
#   This satisfies the 5-day stay and the constraint to visit relatives between day 8 and 12.

# Calculate itinerary segments using calendar days:
# Segment definitions: Each segment is defined by a day range [start, end] and a city.
# Note: if a flight is taken on a certain day, that day is counted in both the origin and destination segments.
# Our computed segments (with overlaps) will be:
#   Prague: day 1 to day 2 (2 days)
#   Stockholm: day 2 to day 6 (5 days: days 2,3,4,5,6)
#   Berlin: day 6 to day 8 (3 days: days 6,7,8)
#   Tallinn: day 8 to day 12 (5 days: days 8,9,10,11,12)
