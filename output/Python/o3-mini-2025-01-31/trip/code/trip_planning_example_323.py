# We need 3 flight transitions (because if flight on day X counts for both origin and destination,
# then total unique days = (sum of required durations) - (number of flight transitions)).
# That is, (7 + 5 + 2 + 5) - flight_transitions = 16, so flight_transitions must be 3.
flight_transitions_needed = 3

# We choose a route that satisfies both the flight connections and the scheduling constraints:
# 1. London must be visited early to see relatives between day 1 and day 7.
# 2. Split must host the annual show between day 7 and day 11.
# 3. We have available direct flights between London and Split, Split and Oslo, and Oslo and Porto.
#
# Thus we pick the route: London -> Split -> Oslo -> Porto.
#
# To use the flight-day overlap rule, we schedule the days as follows:
#
# - London: Days 1 to 7 (7 days). The departure from London to Split will occur on day 7,
#   so day 7 counts as being in London as well as Split.
# - Split: Days 7 to 11 (5 days). The annual show is from day 7 to 11.
# - Oslo: Days 11 to 12 (2 days). The flight from Split to Oslo occurs on day 11.
# - Porto: Days 12 to 16 (5 days). The flight from Oslo to Porto occurs on day 12.
#
# Unique days calculation: 7 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 19 days if counted separately, but with 3
# overlapping flight days (day 7, day 11, day 12) the unique days become: 19 - 3 = 16 days,
# which matches the trip constraint.
#
# Construct the itinerary with day_range and place entries.
