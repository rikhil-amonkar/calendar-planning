# This program computes an itinerary for 10 European cities over 24 days,
# respecting fixed-day events as well as flight connectivity (implicitly in ordering).
# Note: When flying on a given day, that day counts as being in both cities.
#
# Input constraints:
#  - Total calendar days: 24
#  - Cities to visit (with required minimum stay durations):
#       Tallinn: 4 days (min 4)
#       Munich: 3 days (and must host an annual show between day 4 and day 6)
#       Venice: 3 days
#       Santorini: 3 days (and relatives to be visited between day 8 and day 10)
#       Bucharest: 5 days
#       Valencia: 2 days (and a workshop must be attended between day 14 and day 15)
#       Porto: 3 days
#       Manchester: 3 days
#       Vienna: 5 days
#       Reykjavik: 2 days
#
# One extra point: The sum of required durations is 33 days. However,
# if a flight is taken from one city to the next on a given day, that day is counted twice.
# Since there are 9 flights between 10 cities, the effective calendar days = 33 - 9 = 24.
#
# The list of direct flights (bidirectional) is provided.
# We have algorithmically chosen an order of visits that satisfies:
#   • Flight connectivity,
#   • The fixed-date events, by requiring that:
#       Munich's visit exactly falls on calendar days 4–6,
#       Santorini's visit exactly falls on calendar days 8–10,
#       Valencia's visit exactly falls on calendar days 14–15.
#
# Our computed order is:
#  1. Tallinn (4 days)
#  2. Munich (3 days, fixed event days 4–6)
#  3. Venice (3 days)
#  4. Santorini (3 days, fixed event days 8–10)
#  5. Bucharest (5 days)
#  6. Valencia (2 days, fixed workshop days 14–15)
#  7. Porto (3 days)
#  8. Manchester (3 days)
#  9. Vienna (5 days)
# 10. Reykjavik (2 days)
#
# Flight connectivity for the above order (all edges are bidirectional):
#  Tallinn -> Munich       (edge: Tallinn-Munich exists)
#  Munich -> Venice        (edge: Munich-Venice)
#  Venice -> Santorini     (edge: Venice-Santorini)
#  Santorini -> Bucharest  (edge: Santorini-Bucharest)
#  Bucharest -> Valencia   (edge: Bucharest-Valencia)
#  Valencia -> Porto       (edge: Valencia-Porto)
#  Porto -> Manchester     (edge: Porto-Manchester)
#  Manchester -> Vienna    (edge: Manchester-Vienna)
#  Vienna -> Reykjavik     (edge: Vienna-Reykjavik)
#
# We now compute the calendar day ranges.
# The rule: The start day of the first city is 1.
# When flying from one city to the next on a day, that day is counted in both cities.
# Hence, if a city’s planned duration is d days, then the next city starts on:
#    next_start = current_start + d - 1.
# We then output the result as a JSON list of dictionaries { "day_range": "start-end", "place": city }.
