# Total trip days = 29, total cities = 10.
# The required stay durations in each city (the “required” days while in that city)
# Note: When flying from one city to the next, the flight day is counted in both the departing and arriving city.
# Thus, the sum of individual stays minus the (number of flights) equals the total days.
# We have 10 cities and hence 9 flights. (sum(durations) - 9 = 29)
# The required durations (as if they were standalone) are:
durations = {

    "Amsterdam": 3,
    "Valencia": 2,    # and attend annual show between day5 and day6
    "Vienna": 5,      # and attend wedding between day6 and day10
    "Reykjavik": 5,
    "Athens": 5,      # and attend workshop between day14 and day18
    "Riga": 3,        # and attend conference between day18 and day20
    "Bucharest": 3,

# There are several direct flight connections available.
# For our itinerary, we choose the following order of cities that:
#  - Uses only direct flight connections as provided.
#  - Satisfies the time-bound events.
# The chosen order is:
# 1. Stockholm      (3 days)      [Meeting friend between day1-3]
# 2. Amsterdam      (3 days)
# 3. Valencia       (2 days)      [Annual show on day5-6]
# 4. Vienna         (5 days)      [Wedding on day6-10]
# 5. Reykjavik      (5 days)
# 6. Athens         (5 days)      [Workshop on day14-18]
# 7. Riga           (3 days)      [Conference on day18-20]
# 8. Bucharest      (3 days)
# 9. Frankfurt      (4 days)
# 10. Salzburg      (5 days) 
#
# Check flight connections for each adjacent pair:
# Stockholm -> Amsterdam         : Direct flight exists (Stockholm and Amsterdam)
# Amsterdam -> Valencia          : Direct flight exists (Amsterdam and Valencia)
# Valencia -> Vienna             : Direct flight exists (Valencia and Vienna)
# Vienna -> Reykjavik            : Direct flight exists (Vienna and Reykjavik)
# Reykjavik -> Athens            : Direct flight exists (from Reykjavik to Athens)
# Athens -> Riga                 : Direct flight exists (from Athens to Riga)
# Riga -> Bucharest              : Direct flight exists (Riga and Bucharest)
# Bucharest -> Frankfurt         : Direct flight exists (Bucharest and Frankfurt)
# Frankfurt -> Salzburg          : Direct flight exists (Frankfurt and Salzburg)
#
# With these durations and 9 flight “overlap” days, the total trip days:
#   sum(durations) - 9 = (3+3+2+5+5+5+3+3+4+5) - 9 = 38 - 9 = 29 days.
#
# Now we assign day ranges for each city.
# The rule is: let start_day[0] = 1, and for each city i, the next city starts on:
#      start_day[i+1] = start_day[i] + duration[i] - 1
# Each city's day range is [start_day, start_day + duration - 1].
