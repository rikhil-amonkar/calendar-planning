def compute_itinerary():
    # Input constraints and flight network (given implicitly by allowed transitions)
    # We have 5 cities with required durations:
    # Zurich: 3 days (with wedding between day 1 and day 3)
    # Helsinki: 2 days
    # Split: 7 days (with conference on day 4 and day 10 in Split)
    # Hamburg: 2 days
    # Bucharest: 2 days
    #
    # Total "required" day counts = 3 + 2 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 16.
    # Overlapping rule: when flying from A to B on day X, that day counts for both cities.
    # With L flights, total distinct days = (sum of durations) - L.
    # We are given total distinct days = 12, so L = 16 - 12 = 4 flights.
    #
    # We must choose an order of visits (a route with 5 segments and 4 flights) that:
    #   1. Places Zurich first (to meet the wedding constraint between day 1 and 3).
    #   2. Has Split placed so that its day range covers days 4 and 10 (for the conferences).
    #   3. Uses only direct flights from the provided network.
    #
    # The allowed direct flights are:
    #   Zurich <-> Helsinki, Hamburg, Bucharest, Split
    #   Helsinki <-> Hamburg, Split
    #   Hamburg <-> Bucharest, Zurich, Split
    #   Bucharest <-> Zurich, Hamburg
    #
    # A route that fits all these constraints is:
    #   1. City1: Zurich (duration: 3 days, meeting the wedding condition)
    #   2. City2: Helsinki (duration: 2 days)
    #       From Zurich to Helsinki exists.
    #   3. City3: Split (duration: 7 days; this block will span from day 4 to day 10,
    #       meeting the conference days requirement)
    #       Helsinki to Split exists.
    #   4. City4: Hamburg (duration: 2 days)
    #       Split to Hamburg exists.
    #   5. City5: Bucharest (duration: 2 days)
    #       Hamburg to Bucharest exists.
    #
    # With overlapping flight days:
    #   - Flight from City1 to City2 occurs on day 3 (so day 3 counts for both Zurich and Helsinki).
    #   - Flight from City2 to City3 occurs on day 4.
    #   - Flight from City3 to City4 occurs on day 10.
    #   - Flight from City4 to City5 occurs on day 11.
    #
    # Let durations be:
    d1 = 3  # Zurich
    d2 = 2  # Helsinki
    d3 = 7  # Split
    d4 = 2  # Hamburg
    d5 = 2  # Bucharest
    
    # Total days distinct = (d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5) - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12 (as required)
    
    # Compute the day ranges.
    # The itinerary is computed using the overlap rule:
    #   City1: occupies days 1 to d1.
    #   City2: flight day is the last day of City1 and first day of City2.
    #           So City2 covers: [d1, d1 + d2 - 1]
    #   City3: covers: [d1 + d2 - 1, d1 + d2 + d3 - 2]
    #   City4: covers: [d1 + d2 + d3 - 2, d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 - 3]
    #   City5: covers: [d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 - 3, d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 - 4]
    
    day1_start = 1

    day3_end = day3_start + d3 - 1
    day4_start = day3_end  # overlap flight day from City3 to City4
