            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on given constraints. Let me break down the problem and figure out how to approach it.\n\nFirst, the input parameters are a bunch of travel times between different districts in San Francisco. Then, there are constraints about when and where each friend is available, and how much time I want to spend with each of them. The goal is to maximize the number of friends I meet while respecting all the constraints, including travel times and meeting durations.\n\nSo, I'll start by understanding the constraints. I arrive at Sunset District at 9:00 AM. Each friend has a specific location and a time window during which I can meet them. For each friend, I need to allocate a time slot that fits within their availability and allows me to travel to their location and spend the required minimum time.\n\nI think the first step is to represent all the data in a structured way. I'll create a dictionary for travel times, where each key is a tuple of (from, to) districts, and the value is the time in minutes. Then, I'll create another dictionary for each friend, containing their name, location, available start and end times, and the required meeting duration.\n\nNext, I need to figure out the order in which to meet friends. Since I start at Sunset District, the first meeting should be as early as possible, considering travel time. But I also need to make sure that each subsequent meeting can be reached in time, including the travel from the previous location.\n\nI think a greedy approach might work here. I'll sort the friends based on their earliest possible start time and try to fit them into the schedule one by one, ensuring that each meeting doesn't overlap and that the travel time is accounted for.\n\nWait, but some friends have longer availability windows. Maybe I should prioritize friends who are available for a shorter period or have a larger required meeting time. Alternatively, I could consider the earliest possible end time to fit more meetings.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to maximize the number of friends met, perhaps I should try all possible orders and select the one that allows the most meetings without conflict. But that might be computationally intensive, especially with 10 friends. Maybe a heuristic approach is better, like scheduling the friends with the earliest end times first.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Parse all the travel times into a dictionary.\n2. Parse each friend's constraints into a list of dictionaries, each containing their name, location, start time, end time, and required duration.\n3. Sort the friends based on some criteria\u2014maybe the earliest end time, so that we can fit more meetings afterward.\n4. For each friend in this sorted list, check if it's possible to fit a meeting into the current schedule without overlapping and respecting travel times.\n5. If it fits, add it to the itinerary and update the current time and location.\n6. Continue until all possible friends are added.\n\nBut how do I handle the travel times between locations? Each time I meet someone, I have to calculate the time it takes to get from the current location to the next friend's location. This affects the start time of the next meeting.\n\nWait, but the current location changes after each meeting. So the order in which I visit friends affects the total travel time and thus the feasibility of subsequent meetings.\n\nThis sounds like a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard. But since there are only 10 friends, maybe a brute-force approach with permutations is feasible. However, 10! is 3.6 million, which might be manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a graph problem where each node represents a friend, and edges represent the possibility of moving from one friend's location to another without violating time constraints. Then, find the longest possible path that visits as many nodes as possible.\n\nBut that might be complex. Maybe a better approach is to use a backtracking algorithm that tries to add each friend in all possible orders, keeping track of the current time and location, and selecting the path that results in the maximum number of meetings.\n\nHowever, with 10 friends, backtracking might be too slow. So perhaps a heuristic approach is better, such as using a priority queue where we prioritize friends who have earlier end times or tighter constraints.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. Each friend has a specific time window, and I need to spend a certain amount of time with them. So for each friend, the earliest I can arrive is their start time, and the latest I can arrive is their end time minus the required duration.\n\nFor example, Charles is at Presidio from 1:15 PM to 3:00 PM, and I need to meet him for at least 105 minutes. So the latest I can arrive is 3:00 PM minus 105 minutes, which is 1:15 PM. Wait, that can't be right because 105 minutes is 1 hour and 45 minutes. 3:00 PM minus 1:45 is 1:15 PM. So I must arrive exactly at 1:15 PM and spend until 3:00 PM. That's a fixed time slot for Charles.\n\nWait, that's interesting. For some friends, the required duration is such that their available window exactly fits the meeting. For example, Charles's available time is from 1:15 PM to 3:00 PM, which is exactly 1 hour and 45 minutes (105 minutes). So I have no choice but to meet him from 1:15 PM to 3:00 PM. Similarly, I should check for other friends.\n\nLet me check each friend:\n\n- Charles: 1:15 PM to 3:00 PM (105 mins) \u2192 must meet exactly during this time.\n- Robert: 1:15 PM to 5:30 PM (4h15m) \u2192 need 90 mins. So possible slots are from 1:15 PM to (5:30 PM - 90 mins)= 4:00 PM. So arrival can be between 1:15 PM and 4:00 PM, but need to spend 90 mins.\n- Nancy: 2:45 PM to 10:00 PM \u2192 105 mins. So latest arrival is 10:00 PM - 105 mins = 8:15 PM.\n- Brian: 3:30 PM to 10:00 PM \u2192 60 mins. Latest arrival 9:00 PM.\n- Kimberly: 5:00 PM to 7:45 PM \u2192 75 mins. Latest arrival 7:45 PM - 75 mins = 6:30 PM.\n- David: 2:45 PM to 4:30 PM \u2192 75 mins. Latest arrival 4:30 PM - 75 mins = 3:15 PM.\n- William: 12:30 PM to 7:15 PM \u2192 120 mins. Latest arrival 7:15 PM - 120 mins = 5:15 PM.\n- Jeffrey: 12:00 PM to 7:15 PM \u2192 45 mins. Latest arrival 7:15 PM - 45 mins = 6:30 PM.\n- Karen: 2:15 PM to 8:45 PM \u2192 60 mins. Latest arrival 8:45 PM - 60 mins = 7:45 PM.\n- Joshua: 6:45 PM to 10:00 PM \u2192 60 mins. Latest arrival 9:00 PM.\n\nWait, for some friends, the required duration is equal to their available window, so they must be met during that exact time. For others, there's flexibility.\n\nSo, perhaps I should first handle the friends with fixed time slots, as they have no flexibility. Charles, for example, must be met from 1:15 PM to 3:00 PM. Similarly, let me check others:\n\n- David's available time is from 2:45 PM to 4:30 PM, and required duration is 75 mins. So his meeting can start any time between 2:45 PM and 3:15 PM (since 4:30 PM - 75 mins is 3:15 PM). So he has a 30-minute window for the start time.\n\nSo, the plan is to first schedule friends with fixed or tight time slots, as they are more restrictive.\n\nI think the approach should be:\n\n1. Identify all friends and their possible meeting slots.\n2. Sort them based on the earliest possible start time or the tightest constraints.\n3. Try to fit each friend into the schedule, considering travel times from the previous location.\n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nI think I can represent each friend as a dictionary with their details. Then, for each possible permutation of friends, check if it's possible to schedule them without overlapping and respecting the constraints. However, with 10 friends, this approach is computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a backtracking approach where I try to add each friend one by one, checking if adding them is possible given the current schedule. This way, I can explore possible combinations without checking all permutations.\n\nBut even backtracking might be slow for 10 friends. Maybe I can use memoization or pruning to speed it up.\n\nWait, but perhaps a greedy approach is sufficient. Let me try to sort the friends based on their earliest possible end time. That way, I can fit as many as possible.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort them by the latest possible start time, so that I handle the most constrained first.\n\nLet me think about the steps the code needs to perform:\n\n- Parse the travel times into a dictionary for quick lookup.\n- Parse each friend's constraints into a list, each with name, location, start, end, duration.\n- For each friend, calculate the earliest possible start time (their availability start) and latest possible start time (end - duration).\n- Sort the friends in an order that allows the most meetings. Perhaps by latest possible start time, so that we handle the most constrained first.\n- Then, try to add each friend in this order, checking if it's possible to fit them into the current schedule, considering travel time from the last location.\n\nWait, but the order also depends on the locations. For example, if two friends are in the same area, it's better to meet them consecutively to save travel time.\n\nThis complicates things. Maybe I should group friends by location, but that's not possible since each is in a different location.\n\nAlternatively, for each friend, after the initial location (Sunset District), calculate the travel time to their location and see if it's possible to arrive before their latest possible start time.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let me outline the algorithm more clearly.\n\nInitialize:\n\n- current_time = 9:00 AM\n- current_location = 'Sunset District'\n- itinerary = []\n\nFor each friend in sorted order:\n\n1. Calculate the earliest arrival time at the friend's location: current_time + travel_time from current_location to friend's location.\n2. Check if this arrival time is before or equal to the friend's latest possible start time.\n3. If yes, schedule the meeting from the arrival time to arrival_time + duration.\n4. Update current_time and current_location to the end of this meeting and the friend's location.\n5. Add this meeting to the itinerary.\n6. If not, skip this friend.\n\nBut this approach might not work because the order of friends matters. For example, meeting a friend further away first might prevent meeting another friend with a tighter schedule.\n\nSo, perhaps the sorting order is crucial. I need to find an order that allows the maximum number of friends to be met.\n\nAnother idea: for each friend, calculate the earliest possible time I can arrive at their location after the previous meeting. If that time is within their available window, and allows the required duration, then it's possible.\n\nBut the problem is that the order of friends affects the arrival times. So, I need to find the best order.\n\nThis sounds like the Traveling Salesman Problem with time windows. It's a complex problem, and solving it optimally might require advanced algorithms. But given the problem constraints, perhaps a heuristic approach is acceptable.\n\nLet me think about how to implement a backtracking solution. The idea is to try all possible orders of friends, and for each order, check if it's possible to schedule all the meetings without overlapping and respecting the constraints.\n\nBut with 10 friends, this would be 10! = 3,628,800 permutations, which might be manageable in Python, but could be slow. However, with pruning, it might be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a recursive function that tries to add each friend one by one, checking if it's possible to fit them into the current schedule. The function would track the current time and location, and the list of scheduled friends. It would explore all possible orders, but with pruning to avoid impossible paths early.\n\nBut even this might be too slow for 10 friends. So perhaps a better approach is to use dynamic programming or memoization to store the state of scheduled friends and the current time and location.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the problem as a graph where each node is a subset of friends visited, along with the current time and location. Edges represent adding a new friend to the subset. The goal is to find the largest subset where the schedule is feasible.\n\nBut this approach is also computationally intensive, as the number of subsets is 2^10 = 1024, but each subset can have multiple states based on current time and location.\n\nHmm. Maybe a better approach is to model this as a state where each state is defined by the current time, current location, and the set of friends met so far. The goal is to find the state with the maximum number of friends met.\n\nBut again, this could be computationally heavy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a heuristic approach is better, such as using a priority queue where we prioritize friends who have earlier end times or are closer in distance, allowing us to fit more meetings.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent each friend as a node and use a priority-based selection, always choosing the next friend that allows the earliest possible end time, thus leaving more time for others.\n\nLet me outline this approach:\n\n1. Initialize current_time as 9:00 AM and current_location as 'Sunset District'.\n2. Create a list of all friends, each with their details.\n3. While there are friends left:\n   a. For each remaining friend, calculate the earliest possible arrival time at their location (current_time + travel time from current_location to their location).\n   b. Check if this arrival time is within their available window and allows the required duration.\n   c. For each possible friend, calculate the end time after meeting them (arrival_time + duration).\n   d. Select the friend with the earliest end time, as this leaves more time for other meetings.\n   e. Add this friend to the itinerary, update current_time and current_location, and remove them from the list.\n\nThis is a greedy approach, selecting the next friend that allows the earliest completion, which might help in fitting more meetings.\n\nBut this approach might not always yield the optimal solution, as selecting a friend that ends earlier might prevent meeting another friend with a later but necessary time slot. However, given the problem constraints, it might be a reasonable approximation.\n\nLet me try to model this approach.\n\nFirst, I'll represent each friend's data:\n\nFor example, Charles is at Presidio, available from 13:15 to 15:00, needs 105 mins. So his latest possible start is 15:00 - 105 mins = 13:15. So he must be met exactly at 13:15 to 15:00.\n\nSimilarly, for each friend, I'll calculate their earliest and latest possible start times.\n\nThen, for each friend, when considering adding them to the schedule, I'll calculate the arrival time based on the current location and time.\n\nIf the arrival time is before or equal to their latest possible start time, then it's possible to meet them.\n\nOnce a friend is added, the current time and location are updated.\n\nSo, in code, I can:\n\n- Represent each friend as a dictionary with 'name', 'location', 'start', 'end', 'duration', 'earliest_start', 'latest_start', 'earliest_end', 'latest_end'.\n\nWait, 'earliest_start' is their availability start, 'latest_start' is end - duration.\n\nThen, for each friend, the possible meeting can start any time between their earliest_start and latest_start, provided that the arrival time is within that window.\n\nBut when considering scheduling, I have to calculate the arrival time based on the current location and time.\n\nSo, for each friend, the earliest possible arrival is current_time + travel_time(current_location, friend.location).\n\nIf this arrival_time is <= friend.latest_start, then I can schedule the meeting, starting at arrival_time, ending at arrival_time + duration.\n\nBut wait, the friend's available time must also start before the meeting starts. So, the meeting start must be >= friend.start, and meeting end <= friend.end.\n\nWait, no. The meeting can start as early as possible, but the friend is only available from their start time. So, the meeting start must be >= friend.start, and the meeting end must be <= friend.end.\n\nSo, when calculating whether a friend can be met, the arrival_time must be >= friend.start, and arrival_time + duration <= friend.end.\n\nWait, no. Because the arrival_time is the time I arrive at the friend's location. The meeting can only start once I'm there, but the friend is available from their start time. So, the meeting can start at max(arrival_time, friend.start), and end at start + duration, which must be <= friend.end.\n\nSo, the condition is:\n\nmeeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend.start)\nmeeting_end = meeting_start + duration\n\nif meeting_end <= friend.end \u2192 possible.\n\nSo, in code, for a given friend and current state, I can compute whether it's possible to meet them.\n\nNow, the algorithm steps could be:\n\n1. Initialize current_time as 9:00 AM, current_location as 'Sunset District', and itinerary as empty.\n\n2. Create a list of all friends, each with their details, including start, end, duration, location.\n\n3. While there are friends left to consider:\n\n   a. For each remaining friend, calculate the arrival_time as current_time + travel_time from current_location to friend.location.\n\n   b. Compute meeting_start as max(arrival_time, friend.start).\n\n   c. Compute meeting_end as meeting_start + friend.duration.\n\n   d. If meeting_end <= friend.end, then this friend is a candidate.\n\n   e. Among all candidate friends, select the one with the earliest meeting_end. This is the greedy choice to leave as much time as possible for others.\n\n   f. Add this friend to the itinerary, update current_time to meeting_end, and current_location to friend.location.\n\n   g. Remove this friend from the list.\n\n4. Once all friends are processed, output the itinerary.\n\nBut wait, this approach might not consider all possible orders. For example, choosing a friend that ends earlier might prevent meeting another friend who could have been scheduled if a different order was chosen.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps this is the best approach for now.\n\nLet me try to apply this algorithm step by step to the given constraints.\n\nStarting at 9:00 AM in Sunset District.\n\nList of friends:\n\n1. Charles: Presidio, 13:15-15:00, 105 mins.\n2. Robert: Nob Hill, 13:15-17:30, 90 mins.\n3. Nancy: Pacific Heights, 14:45-22:00, 105 mins.\n4. Brian: Mission District, 15:30-22:00, 60 mins.\n5. Kimberly: Marina District, 17:00-19:45, 75 mins.\n6. David: North Beach, 14:45-16:30, 75 mins.\n7. William: Russian Hill, 12:30-19:15, 120 mins.\n8. Jeffrey: Richmond District, 12:00-19:15, 45 mins.\n9. Karen: Embarcadero, 14:15-20:45, 60 mins.\n10. Joshua: Alamo Square, 18:45-22:00, 60 mins.\n\nFirst, I need to sort or select the next friend based on the earliest possible end time.\n\nBut let's compute for each friend the arrival time from Sunset District.\n\nCompute arrival_time for each friend from Sunset District:\n\n- Charles: travel time from Sunset to Presidio is 16 mins. So arrival at 9:00 + 0:16 = 9:16 AM.\n\nBut Charles is available from 13:15. So meeting_start would be 13:15, meeting_end 15:00.\n\n- Robert: Sunset to Nob Hill is 27 mins. Arrival at 9:27 AM. His available starts at 13:15.\n\n- Nancy: Sunset to Pacific Heights is 21 mins. Arrival at 9:21 AM.\n\n- Brian: Sunset to Mission District is 25 mins. Arrival at 9:25 AM.\n\n- Kimberly: Sunset to Marina is 21 mins. Arrival at 9:21 AM.\n\n- David: Sunset to North Beach is 28 mins. Arrival at 9:28 AM.\n\n- William: Sunset to Russian Hill is 24 mins. Arrival at 9:24 AM.\n\n- Jeffrey: Sunset to Richmond is 12 mins. Arrival at 9:12 AM.\n\n- Karen: Sunset to Embarcadero is 30 mins. Arrival at 9:30 AM.\n\n- Joshua: Sunset to Alamo Square is 17 mins. Arrival at 9:17 AM.\n\nNow, for each friend, compute if they can be met after arriving.\n\nBut since current_time is 9:00 AM, and most friends are available in the afternoon, the earliest possible meetings can't start until their available time.\n\nSo, the first possible meeting is the one with the earliest possible start time.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, I should select the friend with the earliest possible end time.\n\nWait, but all the arrival times are in the morning, but their available times start in the afternoon. So the earliest possible meeting is the one whose available start is the earliest.\n\nSo, for example, Jeffrey is available from 12:00 PM. So, arrival at 9:12 AM, but can't meet until 12:00 PM.\n\nSimilarly, William is available from 12:30 PM.\n\nSo, the earliest possible meeting is Jeffrey at 12:00 PM.\n\nLet me compute for each friend:\n\narrival_time = current_time + travel_time\n\nmeeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend.start)\n\nmeeting_end = meeting_start + duration\n\nIf meeting_end <= friend.end \u2192 possible.\n\nSo, for Jeffrey:\n\narrival_time = 9:12 AM.\n\nmeeting_start = max(9:12, 12:00) = 12:00 PM.\n\nmeeting_end = 12:00 + 45 mins = 12:45 PM.\n\nWhich is within his available end time of 19:15.\n\nSo, this is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, for William:\n\narrival_time = 9:24 AM.\n\nmeeting_start = max(9:24, 12:30) = 12:30 PM.\n\nmeeting_end = 12:30 + 120 = 14:30 (2:30 PM).\n\nWhich is within his end time of 19:15.\n\nSo, both Jeffrey and William are possible.\n\nNow, between Jeffrey and William, which one should I choose? The one with the earlier meeting_end.\n\nJeffrey ends at 12:45 PM, William at 2:30 PM. So, choosing Jeffrey first leaves more time for others.\n\nSo, the first meeting is Jeffrey in Richmond District from 12:00 PM to 12:45 PM.\n\nNow, current_time is 12:45 PM, current_location is Richmond District.\n\nNext, for the remaining friends, compute arrival times from Richmond District.\n\nLet's list the friends again, excluding Jeffrey:\n\nCharles, Robert, Nancy, Brian, Kimberly, David, William, Karen, Joshua.\n\nCompute arrival_time for each from Richmond District.\n\nRichmond to Presidio: 7 mins.\n\nRichmond to Nob Hill: 17 mins.\n\nRichmond to Pacific Heights: 10 mins.\n\nRichmond to Mission District: 20 mins.\n\nRichmond to Marina: 9 mins.\n\nRichmond to North Beach: 17 mins.\n\nRichmond to Russian Hill: 13 mins.\n\nRichmond to Embarcadero: 19 mins.\n\nRichmond to Alamo Square: 13 mins.\n\nSo, arrival times:\n\nCharles: 12:45 + 7 = 12:52 PM.\n\nRobert: 12:45 +17= 1:02 PM.\n\nNancy: 12:45 +10= 12:55 PM.\n\nBrian: 12:45 +20= 1:05 PM.\n\nKimberly: 12:45 +9= 12:54 PM.\n\nDavid: 12:45 +17= 1:02 PM.\n\nWilliam: 12:45 +13= 12:58 PM.\n\nKaren: 12:45 +19= 1:04 PM.\n\nJoshua: 12:45 +13= 12:58 PM.\n\nNow, for each friend, compute meeting_start and meeting_end.\n\nCharles:\n\nmeeting_start = max(12:52 PM, 1:15 PM) \u2192 1:15 PM.\n\nmeeting_end = 1:15 +105= 3:00 PM.\n\nWhich is within his end time.\n\nRobert:\n\nmeeting_start = max(1:02 PM, 1:15 PM) \u2192 1:15 PM.\n\nmeeting_end = 1:15 +90= 2:45 PM.\n\nNancy:\n\nmeeting_start = max(12:55 PM, 2:45 PM) \u2192 2:45 PM.\n\nmeeting_end = 2:45 +105= 4:30 PM.\n\nBrian:\n\nmeeting_start = max(1:05 PM, 3:30 PM) \u2192 3:30 PM.\n\nmeeting_end = 3:30 +60= 4:30 PM.\n\nKimberly:\n\nmeeting_start = max(12:54 PM, 5:00 PM) \u2192 5:00 PM.\n\nmeeting_end =5:00 +75=6:15 PM.\n\nDavid:\n\nmeeting_start = max(1:02 PM, 2:45 PM) \u21922:45 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=2:45+75=3:60=4:00 PM.\n\nWilliam:\n\nmeeting_start = max(12:58 PM, 12:30 PM) \u219212:58 PM.\n\nBut wait, William's available start is 12:30 PM, so 12:58 is after that. So, meeting_start is 12:58 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=12:58 +120= 2:58 PM.\n\nWhich is within his end time of 7:15 PM.\n\nKaren:\n\nmeeting_start = max(1:04 PM, 2:15 PM) \u21922:15 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=2:15 +60=3:15 PM.\n\nJoshua:\n\nmeeting_start = max(12:58 PM, 6:45 PM) \u21926:45 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=6:45 +60=7:45 PM.\n\nNow, among these, which friends can be scheduled?\n\nAll of them except perhaps those whose meeting_end exceeds their available end.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n- Charles: 3:00 PM \u22643:00 PM \u2192 yes.\n- Robert: 2:45 PM \u22645:30 PM \u2192 yes.\n- Nancy:4:30 PM \u226410:00 PM \u2192 yes.\n- Brian:4:30 PM \u226410:00 PM \u2192 yes.\n- Kimberly:6:15 PM \u22647:45 PM \u2192 yes.\n- David:4:00 PM \u22644:30 PM \u2192 yes.\n- William:2:58 PM \u22647:15 PM \u2192 yes.\n- Karen:3:15 PM \u22648:45 PM \u2192 yes.\n- Joshua:7:45 PM \u226410:00 PM \u2192 yes.\n\nSo all are possible.\n\nNow, among these, which one has the earliest meeting_end?\n\nLooking at the meeting_end times:\n\n- William: 2:58 PM.\n- Robert:2:45 PM.\n- Karen:3:15 PM.\n- David:4:00 PM.\n- Charles:3:00 PM.\n- Brian:4:30 PM.\n- Nancy:4:30 PM.\n- Kimberly:6:15 PM.\n- Joshua:7:45 PM.\n\nSo the earliest is Robert at 2:45 PM.\n\nWait, no. Wait, Robert's meeting_end is 2:45 PM, which is earlier than William's 2:58 PM.\n\nSo, Robert is the next candidate.\n\nSo, the next meeting is Robert in Nob Hill from 1:15 PM to 2:45 PM.\n\nNow, current_time is 2:45 PM, current_location is Nob Hill.\n\nNext, compute arrival times for remaining friends from Nob Hill.\n\nNob Hill to:\n\nPresidio:17 mins.\n\nPacific Heights:8 mins.\n\nMission District:13 mins.\n\nMarina District:11 mins.\n\nNorth Beach:8 mins.\n\nRussian Hill:5 mins.\n\nEmbarcadero:9 mins.\n\nAlamo Square:11 mins.\n\nSo, arrival times:\n\nCharles:2:45 +17=3:02 PM.\n\nNancy:2:45 +8=2:53 PM.\n\nBrian:2:45 +13=2:58 PM.\n\nKimberly:2:45 +11=2:56 PM.\n\nDavid:2:45 +8=2:53 PM.\n\nWilliam:2:45 +5=2:50 PM.\n\nKaren:2:45 +9=2:54 PM.\n\nJoshua:2:45 +11=2:56 PM.\n\nNow, for each friend, compute meeting_start and meeting_end.\n\nCharles:\n\nmeeting_start = max(3:02 PM, 1:15 PM) \u21923:02 PM.\n\nBut Charles's available end is 3:00 PM. So 3:02 PM is after his end time. So he can't be met now.\n\nSo, Charles is no longer available.\n\nRobert is already met.\n\nNancy:\n\nmeeting_start = max(2:53 PM, 2:45 PM) \u21922:53 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=2:53 +105=4:38 PM.\n\nWhich is within 10:00 PM.\n\nBrian:\n\nmeeting_start = max(2:58 PM, 3:30 PM) \u21923:30 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=4:30 PM.\n\nKimberly:\n\nmeeting_start = max(2:56 PM,5:00 PM) \u21925:00 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=6:15 PM.\n\nDavid:\n\nmeeting_start = max(2:53 PM,2:45 PM) \u21922:53 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=2:53 +75=4:08 PM.\n\nWilliam:\n\nmeeting_start = max(2:50 PM,12:30 PM) \u21922:50 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=2:50 +120=4:50 PM.\n\nKaren:\n\nmeeting_start = max(2:54 PM,2:15 PM) \u21922:54 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=3:54 PM.\n\nJoshua:\n\nmeeting_start = max(2:56 PM,6:45 PM) \u21926:45 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=7:45 PM.\n\nNow, the possible friends are Nancy, Brian, Kimberly, David, William, Karen, Joshua.\n\nCompute their meeting_end times:\n\nNancy:4:38 PM.\n\nBrian:4:30 PM.\n\nKimberly:6:15 PM.\n\nDavid:4:08 PM.\n\nWilliam:4:50 PM.\n\nKaren:3:54 PM.\n\nJoshua:7:45 PM.\n\nThe earliest meeting_end is Karen at 3:54 PM.\n\nWait, no: David ends at 4:08 PM, which is earlier than Karen's 3:54 PM? No, 3:54 is earlier than 4:08.\n\nWait, 3:54 PM is earlier than 4:08 PM. So Karen's meeting ends earlier.\n\nSo, the next friend is Karen in Embarcadero, from 2:54 PM to 3:54 PM.\n\nNow, current_time is 3:54 PM, current_location is Embarcadero.\n\nNext, compute arrival times from Embarcadero to remaining friends.\n\nEmbarcadero to:\n\nPresidio:20 mins.\n\nPacific Heights:11 mins.\n\nMission District:20 mins.\n\nMarina District:12 mins.\n\nNorth Beach:5 mins.\n\nRussian Hill:8 mins.\n\nAlamo Square:19 mins.\n\nSo, arrival times:\n\nNancy:3:54 +11=4:05 PM.\n\nBrian:3:54 +20=4:14 PM.\n\nKimberly:3:54 +12=4:06 PM.\n\nDavid:3:54 +5=3:59 PM.\n\nWilliam:3:54 +8=4:02 PM.\n\nJoshua:3:54 +19=4:13 PM.\n\nNow, for each friend, compute meeting_start and meeting_end.\n\nNancy:\n\nmeeting_start = max(4:05 PM,2:45 PM) \u21924:05 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=4:05 +105=5:50 PM.\n\nWhich is within 10:00 PM.\n\nBrian:\n\nmeeting_start = max(4:14 PM,3:30 PM) \u21924:14 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=5:14 PM.\n\nKimberly:\n\nmeeting_start = max(4:06 PM,5:00 PM) \u21925:00 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=6:15 PM.\n\nDavid:\n\nmeeting_start = max(3:59 PM,2:45 PM) \u21923:59 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=3:59 +75=4:14 PM.\n\nWilliam:\n\nmeeting_start = max(4:02 PM,12:30 PM) \u21924:02 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=4:02 +120=6:02 PM.\n\nJoshua:\n\nmeeting_start = max(4:13 PM,6:45 PM) \u21926:45 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=7:45 PM.\n\nNow, the possible friends are Nancy, Brian, Kimberly, David, William, Joshua.\n\nCompute their meeting_end times:\n\nNancy:5:50 PM.\n\nBrian:5:14 PM.\n\nKimberly:6:15 PM.\n\nDavid:4:14 PM.\n\nWilliam:6:02 PM.\n\nJoshua:7:45 PM.\n\nThe earliest is David at 4:14 PM.\n\nSo, next is David in North Beach from 3:59 PM to 4:14 PM.\n\nWait, but the arrival time is 3:59 PM, which is before his available start of 2:45 PM? No, 3:59 PM is after 2:45 PM.\n\nSo, meeting_start is 3:59 PM, which is within his available time (2:45 PM to 4:30 PM). meeting_end is 4:14 PM, which is within 4:30 PM.\n\nSo, this is valid.\n\nNow, current_time is 4:14 PM, current_location is North Beach.\n\nNext, compute arrival times from North Beach to remaining friends.\n\nNorth Beach to:\n\nPacific Heights:9 mins.\n\nMission District:17 mins.\n\nMarina District:9 mins.\n\nRussian Hill:5 mins.\n\nAlamo Square:15 mins.\n\nSo, arrival times:\n\nNancy:4:14 +9=4:23 PM.\n\nBrian:4:14 +17=4:31 PM.\n\nKimberly:4:14 +9=4:23 PM.\n\nWilliam:4:14 +5=4:19 PM.\n\nJoshua:4:14 +15=4:29 PM.\n\nNow, for each friend:\n\nNancy:\n\nmeeting_start = max(4:23 PM,2:45 PM) \u21924:23 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=4:23 +105=5:28 PM.\n\nBrian:\n\nmeeting_start = max(4:31 PM,3:30 PM) \u21924:31 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=5:31 PM.\n\nKimberly:\n\nmeeting_start = max(4:23 PM,5:00 PM) \u21925:00 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=6:15 PM.\n\nWilliam:\n\nmeeting_start = max(4:19 PM,12:30 PM) \u21924:19 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=4:19 +120=6:19 PM.\n\nJoshua:\n\nmeeting_start = max(4:29 PM,6:45 PM) \u21926:45 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=7:45 PM.\n\nNow, the possible friends are Nancy, Brian, Kimberly, William, Joshua.\n\nCompute their meeting_end times:\n\nNancy:5:28 PM.\n\nBrian:5:31 PM.\n\nKimberly:6:15 PM.\n\nWilliam:6:19 PM.\n\nJoshua:7:45 PM.\n\nThe earliest is Nancy at 5:28 PM.\n\nSo, next is Nancy in Pacific Heights from 4:23 PM to 5:28 PM.\n\nCurrent_time is 5:28 PM, current_location is Pacific Heights.\n\nNext, compute arrival times from Pacific Heights to remaining friends.\n\nPacific Heights to:\n\nMission District:15 mins.\n\nMarina District:6 mins.\n\nRussian Hill:7 mins.\n\nAlamo Square:10 mins.\n\nSo, arrival times:\n\nBrian:5:28 +15=5:43 PM.\n\nKimberly:5:28 +6=5:34 PM.\n\nWilliam:5:28 +7=5:35 PM.\n\nJoshua:5:28 +10=5:38 PM.\n\nNow, for each friend:\n\nBrian:\n\nmeeting_start = max(5:43 PM,3:30 PM) \u21925:43 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=6:43 PM.\n\nWhich is within 10:00 PM.\n\nKimberly:\n\nmeeting_start = max(5:34 PM,5:00 PM) \u21925:34 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=5:34 +75=6:49 PM.\n\nWhich is within 7:45 PM.\n\nWilliam:\n\nmeeting_start = max(5:35 PM,12:30 PM) \u21925:35 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=5:35 +120=7:35 PM.\n\nWhich is within 7:15 PM? No, 7:35 PM is after 7:15 PM. So, William cannot be met now.\n\nJoshua:\n\nmeeting_start = max(5:38 PM,6:45 PM) \u21926:45 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=7:45 PM.\n\nSo, possible friends are Brian, Kimberly, Joshua.\n\nCompute their meeting_end times:\n\nBrian:6:43 PM.\n\nKimberly:6:49 PM.\n\nJoshua:7:45 PM.\n\nThe earliest is Brian at 6:43 PM.\n\nSo, next is Brian in Mission District from 5:43 PM to 6:43 PM.\n\nCurrent_time is 6:43 PM, current_location is Mission District.\n\nNext, compute arrival times from Mission District to remaining friends.\n\nMission District to:\n\nMarina District:19 mins.\n\nRussian Hill:15 mins.\n\nAlamo Square:11 mins.\n\nSo, arrival times:\n\nKimberly:6:43 +19=7:02 PM.\n\nWilliam:6:43 +15=6:58 PM.\n\nJoshua:6:43 +11=6:54 PM.\n\nNow, for each friend:\n\nKimberly:\n\nmeeting_start = max(7:02 PM,5:00 PM) \u21927:02 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=7:02 +75=8:17 PM.\n\nWhich is within 7:45 PM? No, 8:17 PM is after 7:45 PM. So, cannot meet Kimberly now.\n\nWilliam:\n\nmeeting_start = max(6:58 PM,12:30 PM) \u21926:58 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=6:58 +120=8:58 PM.\n\nWhich is within his available end of 7:15 PM? No. So, cannot meet William.\n\nJoshua:\n\nmeeting_start = max(6:54 PM,6:45 PM) \u21926:54 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=6:54 +60=7:54 PM.\n\nWhich is within 10:00 PM.\n\nSo, only Joshua is possible.\n\nSo, next is Joshua in Alamo Square from 6:54 PM to 7:54 PM.\n\nCurrent_time is 7:54 PM, current_location is Alamo Square.\n\nRemaining friends: Kimberly, William.\n\nCompute arrival times from Alamo Square.\n\nAlamo Square to:\n\nMarina District:15 mins.\n\nRussian Hill:13 mins.\n\nSo, arrival times:\n\nKimberly:7:54 +15=8:09 PM.\n\nWilliam:7:54 +13=8:07 PM.\n\nFor Kimberly:\n\nmeeting_start = max(8:09 PM,5:00 PM) \u21928:09 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=8:09 +75=9:24 PM.\n\nWhich is within her end time of 7:45 PM? No, 9:24 PM is after 7:45 PM. So, cannot meet.\n\nWilliam:\n\nmeeting_start = max(8:07 PM,12:30 PM) \u21928:07 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=8:07 +120=10:07 PM.\n\nWhich is within his end time of 7:15 PM? No. So, cannot meet.\n\nThus, no more friends can be met.\n\nSo, the itinerary includes Jeffrey, Robert, Karen, David, Nancy, Brian, Joshua.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. Jeffrey: 12:00-12:45 PM.\n\n2. Robert:1:15-2:45 PM.\n\n3. Karen:2:54-3:54 PM.\n\n4. David:3:59-4:14 PM.\n\n5. Nancy:4:23-5:28 PM.\n\n6. Brian:5:43-6:43 PM.\n\n7. Joshua:6:54-7:54 PM.\n\nThat's 7 friends.\n\nBut wait, the initial list had 10 friends, but some couldn't be met due to time constraints.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better order that allows meeting more friends.\n\nFor example, after meeting Jeffrey, perhaps meeting William earlier would allow more meetings.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Suppose after Jeffrey, instead of meeting Robert, I meet William.\n\nLet me retrace.\n\nAfter Jeffrey: current_time 12:45 PM, location Richmond.\n\nPossible friends: Charles, Robert, Nancy, Brian, Kimberly, David, William, Karen, Joshua.\n\nCompute arrival times:\n\nCharles:12:45 +7=12:52 PM.\n\nRobert:12:45 +17=1:02 PM.\n\nNancy:12:45 +10=12:55 PM.\n\nBrian:12:45 +20=1:05 PM.\n\nKimberly:12:45 +9=12:54 PM.\n\nDavid:12:45 +17=1:02 PM.\n\nWilliam:12:45 +13=12:58 PM.\n\nKaren:12:45 +19=1:04 PM.\n\nJoshua:12:45 +13=12:58 PM.\n\nNow, for each friend, compute meeting_start and meeting_end.\n\nCharles:\n\nmeeting_start=1:15 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=3:00 PM.\n\nRobert:\n\nmeeting_start=1:15 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=2:45 PM.\n\nNancy:\n\nmeeting_start=2:45 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=4:30 PM.\n\nBrian:\n\nmeeting_start=3:30 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=4:30 PM.\n\nKimberly:\n\nmeeting_start=5:00 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=6:15 PM.\n\nDavid:\n\nmeeting_start=2:45 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=4:00 PM.\n\nWilliam:\n\nmeeting_start=12:58 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=2:58 PM.\n\nKaren:\n\nmeeting_start=2:15 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=3:15 PM.\n\nJoshua:\n\nmeeting_start=6:45 PM.\n\nmeeting_end=7:45 PM.\n\nNow, the possible friends are all except Charles (if his meeting_end exceeds his available end?

No. So, cannot meet Kimberly.\n\nThus, the itinerary includes:\n\nJeffrey, William, Karen, Nancy, Brian, David, Joshua.\n\nWait, that's 7 friends as well.\n\nBut in the first approach, we had 7 friends, and in this approach, also 7.\n\nIs there a way to meet more friends?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial order is better.\n\nBut regardless, the code needs to implement this logic.\n\nSo, the code will:\n\n- Read the travel times into a dictionary.\n- Parse each friend's constraints into a list.\n- For each friend, compute earliest and latest possible start times.\n- Use a greedy approach to select the next friend with the earliest possible end time.\n- Update the current time and location after each meeting.\n- Continue until no more friends can be added.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to write the code.\n\nFirst, I'll create a function to convert time strings to minutes since midnight, and vice versa.\n\nThen, I'll read the travel times into a dictionary.\n\nNext, I'll parse each friend's data.\n\nThen, I'll sort the friends based on their latest possible start time, but in the code, I'll dynamically compute the next possible friend.\n\nWait, no. The code will, at each step, consider all remaining friends, compute their possible meeting times, and select the one with the earliest end time.\n\nSo, the code will have a loop that, while there are friends left, selects the best next friend.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, the time conversion functions:\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + mins\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nBut wait, the output requires times in H:MM format without leading zero for hours, so \"9:05\" instead of \"09:05\".\n\nSo, the function should return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\".\n\nNext, read the travel times:\n\ntravel_times = {}\n\nfor line in travel_time_lines:\n    from_loc, to_loc, mins = line.strip().split()\n    travel_times[(from_loc, to_loc)] = int(mins)\n\nWait, but the input lines are given as, for example:\n\nSunset District to Presidio: 16.\n\nSo, I'll split each line into parts.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a large block. So, in the code, I'll have to read these lines, perhaps from a multi-line string.\n\nBut for the code, I'll have to represent the travel times as a dictionary.\n\nSimilarly, the friends' data:\n\nfriends = [\n    {'name': 'Charles', 'location': 'Presidio', 'start': '13:15', 'end': '15:00', 'duration': 105},\n    {'name': 'Robert', 'location': 'Nob Hill', 'start': '13:15', 'end': '17:30', 'duration': 90},\n    # ... and so on for all friends\n]\n\nThen, for each friend, compute their earliest and latest possible start times.\n\nearliest_start = time_to_minutes(friend['start'])\nlatest_start = time_to_minutes(friend['end']) - friend['duration']\n\nSo, for each friend, we can compute whether it's possible to meet them given the current time and location.\n\nNow, the main loop:\n\ncurrent_time = time_to_minutes('9:00')  # 9:00 AM is 540 minutes\ncurrent_location = 'Sunset District'\nitinerary = []\nremaining_friends = friends.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_friends:\n    best_friend = None\n    best_end = float('inf')\n\n    for friend in remaining_friends:\n        # Compute arrival time\n        travel = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), float('inf'))\n        if travel == float('inf'):\n            continue  # no travel time, skip\n        arrival = current_time + travel\n\n        # Compute meeting start and end\n        start = max(arrival, time_to_minutes(friend['start']))\n        end = start + friend['duration']\n\n        # Check if end is within friend's available end\n        if end > time_to_minutes(friend['end']):\n            continue\n\n        # If this meeting ends earlier than current best, update\n        if end < best_end:\n            best_end = end\n            best_friend = friend\n\n    if best_friend is not None:\n        # Add to itinerary\n        start_time = minutes_to_time(max(current_time + travel_times[(current_location, best_friend['location'])], time_to_minutes(best_friend['start'])))\n        end_time = minutes_to_time(start_time + best_friend['duration'])\n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': best_friend['location'],\n            'person': best_friend['name'],\n            'start_time': start_time,\n            'end_time': end_time\n        })\n        current_time = end\n        current_location = best_friend['location']\n        remaining_friends.remove(best_friend)\n    else:\n        break  # no more friends can be scheduled\n\nWait, but the code above has some issues. For example, the 'travel' variable is looked up as (current_location, friend['location']), but the travel_times are stored as (from, to) with the time. Also, the code should compute the arrival time correctly.\n\nWait, no. The code correctly computes the travel time from current_location to friend's location, adds it to current_time to get arrival_time.\n\nBut in the code above, 'travel' is used, but 'arrival' is computed as current_time + travel.\n\nThen, 'start' is max(arrival, friend's start time).\n\nThen, 'end' is start + duration.\n\nIf end is within friend's end time, then it's a candidate.\n\nThe friend with the earliest end time is selected.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, the 'start_time' and 'end_time' are computed as:\n\nstart_time = max(arrival, friend's start)\n\nBut in the code above, it's computed as:\n\nstart_time = max(current_time + travel, friend's start)\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the code, when adding to the itinerary, it's:\n\nstart_time = minutes_to_time(max(current_time + travel, friend's start))\n\nWait, no. Because current_time is in minutes, and travel is the time to add.\n\nBut in the code, 'current_time' is the time before moving, so arrival is current_time + travel.\n\nBut in the code, the 'start' is computed as max(arrival, friend's start), which is correct.\n\nSo, the code should correctly compute the meeting times.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut I need to represent all the travel times correctly.\n\nWait, but the travel times are given for each pair, including both directions. For example, Sunset District to Presidio is 16, and Presidio to Sunset District is 15.\n\nSo, the code correctly looks up the travel time from current_location to friend's location.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut first, I need to represent all the travel times. That's a lot of data.\n\nBut for the code, I'll have to include all the travel times as a dictionary.\n\nSimilarly, the friends' data.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the friends' data is given as:\n\nCharles will be at Presidio from 1:15PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, I'll represent each friend as a dictionary with 'name', 'location', 'start', 'end', 'duration'.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the code is self-contained, with all data included.\n\nSo, the code will have:\n\n- A dictionary for travel times.\n\n- A list of friends.\n\n- The main loop as described.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFirst, the travel times.\n\nI'll create a dictionary where each key is a tuple (from_location, to_location), and the value is the time in minutes.\n\nThen, the friends list.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut due to the length, I'll have to write it carefully.\n\nBut in the code, I'll have to include all the travel times.\n\nSo, the code will start by defining the travel_times dictionary.\n\nThen, the friends list.\n\nThen, the main loop.\n\nBut the code is getting quite long, but it's manageable.\n\nSo, the complete code is as follows.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + mins\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes //
