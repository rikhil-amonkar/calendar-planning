            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to create a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the given constraints. Let's break down the problem and figure out how to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The user is in San Francisco and wants to meet as many friends as possible. They start at North Beach at 9:00 AM. There are two friends to meet: Emily at Union Square and Margaret at Russian Hill. Each has specific time windows and minimum meeting durations.\n\nThe input parameters include travel times between locations and the constraints for each friend. The goal is to compute the best schedule that allows meeting the maximum number of friends within their availability.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is represent the travel times in a way that the program can use. It looks like a dictionary where the keys are tuples of locations, and the values are the travel times in minutes. That makes sense because it allows quick lookup of travel times between any two locations.\n\nNext, I need to represent the friends' data. Each friend has a name, location, start time, end time, and the minimum duration required for the meeting. I'll store these in a list of dictionaries. This way, I can easily iterate over each friend and their details.\n\nNow, the core of the problem is to find the optimal schedule. Since there are only two friends, the number of possible permutations is limited (2! = 2). This makes it feasible to check both possible orders: meeting Emily first and then Margaret, and vice versa.\n\nFor each permutation, I'll simulate the schedule. Starting at North Beach at 9:00 AM, I'll calculate the travel time to the first friend's location. I'll check if arriving at their location is within their available time window. If it is, I'll schedule the meeting, ensuring it meets the minimum duration. Then, I'll calculate the travel time to the next friend's location and repeat the process.\n\nI need to handle the time conversions carefully. All times are in minutes since midnight, which makes it easier to perform arithmetic operations. For example, 9:00 AM is 540 minutes, 4:00 PM is 1020 minutes, and so on. After calculating the start and end times for each meeting, I'll convert these back into HH:MM format for the JSON output.\n\nIt's also important to consider the constraints properly. For each friend, the meeting must start no earlier than their available start time and must end no later than their available end time. Additionally, the meeting duration must be at least the minimum required.\n\nOnce I've evaluated both permutations, I'll select the one that allows meeting the maximum number of friends. If both permutations allow meeting both friends, I'll choose the one that meets both, as that's the optimal solution.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the output as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the itinerary, including the action, location, person, start time, and end time for each meeting.\n\nI also need to make sure that the code is self-contained and runs independently, producing valid JSON when executed. This means I shouldn't rely on any external libraries beyond what's necessary, and I should handle all data parsing and calculations within the code.\n\nPutting it all together, the code will:\n\n1. Define the travel times between locations.\n2. Define the friends' details, including their availability and meeting duration.\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the friends' meeting order.\n4. For each permutation, simulate the schedule, checking feasibility based on travel times and constraints.\n5. Select the permutation that results in the maximum number of meetings.\n6. Format the selected schedule into the required JSON structure and print it.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program dynamically computes the optimal schedule based on the given parameters, rather than relying on a pre-determined solution.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Travel times in minutes between locations\ntravel_times = {\n    ('North Beach', 'Union Square'): 7,\n    ('North Beach', 'Russian Hill'): 4,\n    ('Union Square', 'North Beach'): 10,\n    ('Union Square', 'Russian Hill'): 13,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'North Beach'): 5,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Union Square'): 11,\n}\n\n# List of friends with their meeting details\nfriends = [\n    {'name': 'Emily', 'location': 'Union Square', 'start': 1020, 'end': 1155, 'duration': 45},\n    {'name': 'Margaret', 'location': 'Russian Hill', 'start': 1260, 'end': 1440, 'duration': 120},\n]\n\nmax_meetings = 0\nbest_itinerary = []\n\n# Generate all possible permutations of friends\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_time = 540  # Starting at 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    current_location = 'North Beach'\n    itinerary = []\n    \n    for friend in perm:\n        # Calculate travel time to friend's location\n        travel = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n        if travel is None:\n            break  # No travel time available\n        \n        arrival_time = current_time + travel\n        if arrival_time > friend['end']:\n            break  # Cannot meet this friend\n        \n        # Determine the start and end times for the meeting\n        start_time = max(arrival_time, friend['start'])\n        end_time = start_time + friend['duration']\n        \n        if end_time > friend['end']:\n            break  # Meeting exceeds friend's availability\n        \n        # Format times correctly\n        def format_time(minutes):\n            hours = minutes // 60\n            mins = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n        \n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': format_time(start_time),\n            'end_time': format_time(end_time)\n        })\n        \n        current_time = end_time\n        current_location = friend['location']\n    \n    if len(itinerary) > max_meetings:\n        max_meetings = len(itinerary)\n        best_itinerary = itinerary\n\n# Prepare the result\nresult = {\n    \"itinerary\": best_itinerary\n}\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```",
