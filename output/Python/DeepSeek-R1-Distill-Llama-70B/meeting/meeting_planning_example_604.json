            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to help someone plan their day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible. The user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM and wants to meet up with several friends, each available at different locations and times. The goal is to create an optimal schedule that allows them to meet the maximum number of friends while respecting everyone's availability and accounting for travel times between locations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input parameters. There are six friends, each with their own location, available time window, and minimum meeting duration. The travel times between each pair of locations are provided, so I'll need to use those to calculate the time it takes to move from one place to another.\n\nI think the best approach is to model this as a scheduling problem where I need to find a permutation of friends that can be visited in an order that fits within their availability and allows for the maximum number of meetings. Since the number of friends is manageable (six), I can consider all possible permutations of these friends to evaluate different schedules.\n\nFor each permutation, I'll simulate the day starting at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. I'll calculate the travel time to the first friend's location, check if the meeting can start within their available window and last for the required duration, and then proceed to the next friend, updating the current time and location accordingly. If at any point a meeting can't be scheduled, I'll discard that permutation and try the next one.\n\nTo make this efficient, I'll start by trying permutations that include all six friends and work my way down to fewer friends. This way, I can find the maximum number of friends that can be met. If a valid schedule is found that meets six friends, I can stop there. If not, I'll try permutations of five friends, and so on.\n\nI'll also need to handle the conversion of time between string formats (like \"9:00\") and minutes since midnight to make the calculations easier. This will help in adding travel times and checking time windows.\n\nOnce I have a valid schedule, I'll format it as a JSON dictionary with the specified structure, listing each meeting's action, location, person, start time, and end time.\n\nI should also consider that some friends have very tight time windows, like Daniel, who's only available from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM, requiring just 15 minutes. This might be challenging because the user starts at Fisherman's Wharf, and traveling to Golden Gate Park might take some time. I'll need to ensure that the schedule allows for timely arrival within Daniel's window.\n\nAnother consideration is overlapping time windows. For example, William is available from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, but the user arrives at 9:00 AM. This means the earliest the user can start traveling to William's location is 9:00 AM, but William stops being available at 9:00 AM. So, it might be impossible to meet William unless the travel time is instantaneous, which it's not. Therefore, William might not be meetable under these constraints.\n\nSimilarly, Stephanie is available from 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM. Since the user arrives at 9:00 AM, there might be a small window to meet her if the travel time to Nob Hill isn't too long. Looking at the travel times, Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill takes 11 minutes. So, leaving at 9:00 AM would arrive at 9:11 AM, and needing to meet for 45 minutes would end at 9:56 AM, which is within Stephanie's availability until 9:30 AM. Wait, no, 9:56 AM is after 9:30 AM, so that doesn't work. So, actually, it's impossible to meet Stephanie as well because the meeting would end after her availability window closes.\n\nWait, that's a problem. The user arrives at 9:00 AM, and Stephanie is available until 9:30 AM. The earliest the user can arrive at Nob Hill is 9:00 AM + 11 minutes = 9:11 AM. Meeting for 45 minutes would end at 9:56 AM, which is after Stephanie's 9:30 AM end time. So, it's not possible to meet Stephanie. Therefore, she can't be included in the schedule.\n\nThis means that out of the six friends, William and Stephanie can't be met due to their availability ending at 9:00 AM and 9:30 AM, respectively, and the travel times making it impossible to meet them in time.\n\nSo, the maximum number of friends that can be met is four: Laura, Daniel, Karen, and Joseph, or perhaps Kimberly. I need to see which combination fits best.\n\nLooking at the friends:\n\n- Laura: 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM, 105 minutes at The Castro\n- Daniel: 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM, 15 minutes at Golden Gate Park\n- William: 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, 90 minutes at Embarcadero (not possible)\n- Karen: 2:30 PM to 7:45 PM, 30 minutes at Russian Hill\n- Stephanie: 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM, 45 minutes at Nob Hill (not possible)\n- Joseph: 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM, 15 minutes at Alamo Square\n- Kimberly: 3:45 PM to 7:15 PM, 30 minutes at North Beach\n\nSo, excluding William and Stephanie, we have Laura, Daniel, Karen, Joseph, and Kimberly.\n\nNow, I need to find a permutation of these five friends that allows the user to meet as many as possible, considering travel times and availability.\n\nLet's consider starting with Joseph, who is available from 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM. The user can leave Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM, but Joseph isn't available until 11:30 AM. So, the user could potentially meet Joseph first.\n\nTravel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square is 20 minutes. So, departing at 9:00 AM arrives at 9:20 AM. But Joseph isn't available until 11:30 AM. So, the user would have to wait until 11:30 AM to start the meeting, which is 15 minutes. So, the meeting would end at 11:45 AM.\n\nThen, the user could proceed to Karen at Russian Hill, who is available from 2:30 PM to 7:45 PM. Travel time from Alamo Square to Russian Hill is 13 minutes. So, departing at 11:45 AM arrives at 11:58 AM. But Karen isn't available until 2:30 PM, so the user would have to wait. The meeting would start at 2:30 PM, lasting 30 minutes, ending at 3:00 PM.\n\nNext, the user could go to Kimberly at North Beach, available from 3:45 PM to 7:15 PM. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So, departing at 3:00 PM arrives at 3:05 PM, but Kimberly isn't available until 3:45 PM. So, the meeting starts at 3:45 PM, lasting 30 minutes, ending at 4:15 PM.\n\nThen, the user could head to Laura at The Castro, available from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM. Travel time from North Beach to The Castro is 22 minutes. Departing at 4:15 PM arrives at 4:37 PM. Laura isn't available until 7:45 PM, so the user would have to wait. The meeting starts at 7:45 PM, lasting 105 minutes, ending at 9:30 PM.\n\nFinally, the user could try to meet Daniel at Golden Gate Park, available from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. Travel time from The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. Departing at 9:30 PM arrives at 9:41 PM. The meeting needs to be at least 15 minutes, so it would start at 9:15 PM, but the user arrives at 9:41 PM, which is after Daniel's available start time. Therefore, this meeting isn't possible.\n\nSo, in this permutation, the user can meet Joseph, Karen, Kimberly, and Laura, but not Daniel.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different permutation allows meeting Daniel. Let's try a different order.\n\nSuppose after meeting Laura, the user tries to go to Daniel. But as seen, the timing doesn't work because the user arrives after Daniel's window starts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meeting Daniel before Laura. Let's see.\n\nIf the user meets Laura first, but she's only available starting at 7:45 PM. So, that's too late for Daniel, who is available from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. Wait, no, Daniel's window is later than Laura's. So, perhaps meeting Laura first, then Daniel.\n\nBut as before, the travel time from The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. After meeting Laura until 9:30 PM, the user would arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:41 PM. Daniel's window is from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM, so the meeting could start at 9:15 PM, but the user arrives at 9:41 PM, which is within the window. However, the meeting needs to be at least 15 minutes, so it could start at 9:15 PM, but the user can't arrive until 9:41 PM. Therefore, the meeting would have to start at 9:41 PM and end at 9:56 PM, which is within Daniel's end time of 9:45 PM? Wait, 9:56 PM is after 9:45 PM, so it's not possible. Therefore, Daniel can't be met after Laura.\n\nWhat if the user meets Daniel before Laura? Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Kimberly, the user could go to Daniel at Golden Gate Park. Travel time from North Beach to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes. So, departing at 4:15 PM arrives at 4:37 PM. Daniel isn't available until 9:15 PM, so the user would have to wait. The meeting starts at 9:15 PM, lasting 15 minutes, ending at 9:30 PM. Then, the user could go to Laura at The Castro, with travel time 11 minutes, arriving at 9:41 PM. Laura's window starts at 7:45 PM, so the meeting can start at 9:41 PM, but Laura's window ends at 9:30 PM. Wait, that's a problem. Laura's window is from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM. So, the user arrives at 9:41 PM, which is after Laura's window has closed. Therefore, Laura can't be met in this order.\n\nSo, perhaps the best permutation is meeting Joseph, Karen, Kimberly, and Laura, but not Daniel. Alternatively, maybe another permutation allows meeting Daniel.\n\nWait, what if the user meets Joseph, then Karen, then Daniel, then Laura? Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Joseph at 11:30 AM, the user goes to Karen at Russian Hill, arriving at 11:58 AM, but Karen isn't available until 2:30 PM. So, the meeting starts at 2:30 PM, lasting 30 minutes, ending at 3:00 PM.\n\nThen, the user could go to Daniel at Golden Gate Park. Travel time from Russian Hill to Golden Gate Park is 17 minutes. Departing at 3:00 PM arrives at 3:17 PM. Daniel isn't available until 9:15 PM, so the user would have to wait. The meeting starts at 9:15 PM, lasting 15 minutes, ending at 9:30 PM.\n\nThen, the user could go to Laura at The Castro. Travel time from Golden Gate Park to The Castro is 13 minutes. Departing at 9:30 PM arrives at 9:43 PM. Laura's window is until 9:30 PM, so this is too late. Therefore, Laura can't be met.\n\nSo, in this permutation, the user meets Joseph, Karen, and Daniel, but not Laura or Kimberly.\n\nComparing the two permutations, meeting Joseph, Karen, Kimberly, and Laura gives four meetings, which is better than three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different order allows meeting more friends. Let's try meeting Joseph, then Kimberly, then Karen, then Laura.\n\nAfter Joseph, travel to North Beach (Kimberly). Travel time from Alamo Square to North Beach is 15 minutes. Departing at 11:45 AM arrives at 12:00 PM. Kimberly isn't available until 3:45 PM, so the user waits. Meeting starts at 3:45 PM, lasting 30 minutes, ending at 4:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to Karen at Russian Hill. Travel time from North Beach to Russian Hill is 4 minutes. Departing at 4:15 PM arrives at 4:19 PM. Karen is available until 7:45 PM, so the meeting starts at 4:19 PM, lasting 30 minutes, ending at 4:49 PM.\n\nThen, go to Laura at The Castro. Travel time from Russian Hill to The Castro is 18 minutes. Departing at 4:49 PM arrives at 5:07 PM. Laura isn't available until 7:45 PM, so the user waits. Meeting starts at 7:45 PM, lasting 105 minutes, ending at 9:30 PM.\n\nThis way, the user meets Joseph, Kimberly, Karen, and Laura\u2014four friends.\n\nAlternatively, could the user meet Joseph, then Karen, then Kimberly, then Laura, and still have time for Daniel? Let's see.\n\nAfter Laura, the user is at The Castro at 9:30 PM. Travel time to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes, arriving at 9:41 PM. Daniel's window is until 9:45 PM, so the meeting could start at 9:15 PM, but the user arrives at 9:41 PM. The meeting needs to be at least 15 minutes, so it would end at 9:56 PM, which is after Daniel's 9:45 PM end time. Therefore, Daniel can't be met.\n\nSo, the maximum number of friends that can be met is four: Joseph, Karen, Kimberly, and Laura.\n\nTherefore, the optimal itinerary includes these four friends in an order that allows the user to meet each within their availability windows, considering travel times.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule for a user visiting San Francisco, considering the travel times between locations and the availability of their friends. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible within their specified time windows.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Travel Times**: Represent the travel times between each pair of locations using a dictionary where keys are tuples of locations and values are travel times in minutes.\n2. **Define Friends' Availability**: Represent each friend with their name, location, available start and end times, and the minimum meeting duration required.\n3. **Generate Permutations**: Use permutations to consider all possible orders of meeting friends. This helps in evaluating different schedules to find the optimal one.\n4. **Simulate Schedules**: For each permutation, simulate the schedule starting from Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. Calculate the travel times and check if each meeting can be scheduled within the friend's availability window.\n5. **Check Validity**: For each permutation, ensure that the meeting can start no earlier than the friend's available start time and end no later than their available end time. If a permutation is valid and meets the maximum number of friends, record it as the best itinerary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nimport json\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    h, m = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return h * 60 + m\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    h = minutes // 60\n    m = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{h}:{m:02d}\"\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Fishermans Wharf', 'The Castro'): 26,\n    ('Fishermans Wharf', 'Golden Gate Park'): 25,\n    ('Fishermans Wharf', 'Embarcadero'): 8,\n    ('Fishermans Wharf', 'Russian Hill'): 7,\n    ('Fishermans Wharf', 'Nob Hill'): 11,\n    ('Fishermans Wharf', 'Alamo Square'): 20,\n    ('Fishermans Wharf', 'North Beach'): 6,\n    ('The Castro', 'Fishermans Wharf'): 24,\n    ('The Castro', 'Golden Gate Park'): 11,\n    ('The Castro', 'Embarcadero'): 22,\n    ('The Castro', 'Russian Hill'): 18,\n    ('The Castro', 'Nob Hill'): 16,\n    ('The Castro', 'Alamo Square'): 8,\n    ('The Castro', 'North Beach'): 20,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Fishermans Wharf'): 24,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'The Castro'): 13,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Embarcadero'): 25,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Russian Hill'): 19,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Nob Hill'): 20,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Alamo Square'): 10,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'North Beach'): 24,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Fishermans Wharf'): 6,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'The Castro'): 25,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Golden Gate Park'): 25,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Russian Hill'): 8,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Nob Hill'): 10,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Alamo Square'): 19,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'North Beach'): 5,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Fishermans Wharf'): 7,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'The Castro'): 21,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Golden Gate Park'): 21,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Embarcadero'): 8,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Nob Hill'): 5,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Alamo Square'): 15,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'North Beach'): 5,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Fishermans Wharf'): 11,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'The Castro'): 17,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Golden Gate Park'): 17,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Embarcadero'): 9,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Russian Hill'): 5,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Alamo Square'): 11,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'North Beach'): 8,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Fishermans Wharf'): 19,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'The Castro'): 8,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Golden Gate Park'): 9,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Embarcadero'): 17,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Russian Hill'): 13,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Nob Hill'): 11,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'North Beach'): 16,\n    ('North Beach', 'Fishermans Wharf'): 5,\n    ('North Beach', 'The Castro'): 22,\n    ('North Beach', 'Golden Gate Park'): 22,\n    ('North Beach', 'Embarcadero'): 6,\n    ('North Beach', 'Russian Hill'): 4,\n    ('North Beach', 'Nob Hill'): 7,\n    ('North Beach', 'Alamo Square'): 16,\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Laura',\n        'location': 'The Castro',\n        'start': '19:45',\n        'end': '21:30',\n        'duration': 105\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Daniel',\n        'location': 'Golden Gate Park',\n        'start': '21:15',\n        'end': '21:45',\n        'duration': 15\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'William',\n        'location': 'Embarcadero',\n        'start': '7:00',\n        'end': '9:00',\n        'duration': 90\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Karen',\n        'location': 'Russian Hill',\n        'start': '14:30',\n        'end': '19:45',\n        'duration': 30\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Stephanie',\n        'location': 'Nob Hill',\n        'start': '7:30',\n        'end': '9:30',\n        'duration': 45\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Joseph',\n        'location': 'Alamo Square',\n        'start': '11:30',\n        'end': '12:45',\n        'duration': 15\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Kimberly',\n        'location': 'North Beach',\n        'start': '15:45',\n        'end': '19:15',\n        'duration': 30\n    },\n]\n\nbest_itinerary = []\n\nfor num_friends in range(7, 0, -1):\n    for perm in permutations(friends, num_friends):\n        current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n        current_location = 'Fishermans Wharf'\n        itinerary = []\n        valid = True\n        for friend in perm:\n            # Calculate travel time\n            travel = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n            if travel is None:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            current_time += travel\n            # Convert friend's times to minutes\n            friend_start = time_to_minutes(friend['start'])\n            friend_end = time_to_minutes(friend['end'])\n            # Calculate earliest possible start time\n            earliest_start = max(current_time, friend_start)\n            # Calculate latest possible start time\n            latest_start = friend_end -
