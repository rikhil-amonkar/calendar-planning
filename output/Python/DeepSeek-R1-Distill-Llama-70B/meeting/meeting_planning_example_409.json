            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to write a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the given constraints. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem. The user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM and wants to meet as many friends as possible. Each friend is at a specific location during certain times, and each meeting has a minimum duration. The goal is to find a schedule that allows meeting all or as many friends as possible, considering travel times between locations.\n\nI'll need to model the locations and the travel times between them. The input includes a list of travel times, so I should create a data structure to represent this. Maybe a dictionary where each key is a location, and the value is another dictionary mapping other locations to the travel time in minutes.\n\nNext, I need to represent each friend's availability. Each friend has a location, a start time, an end time, and a minimum meeting duration. So I'll create a list of dictionaries or perhaps a list of objects (if I use classes) to hold this information.\n\nThe main challenge is to find the optimal order of meetings that maximizes the number of friends met while respecting all constraints, including travel times and the time each meeting requires.\n\nI think a brute-force approach might not be efficient, especially since the number of permutations could be high. But given that there are only five friends, maybe it's manageable. Alternatively, I can use a greedy approach, trying to fit as many meetings as possible in the available time slots.\n\nWait, but the order in which we meet friends matters because each meeting affects the next possible start time due to travel. So I need to consider the order carefully.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Parse all the input data: travel times, friends' constraints.\n2. For each possible permutation of friends, check if a valid schedule can be created that meets all constraints.\n3. Among all valid permutations, choose the one that allows meeting the maximum number of friends. If multiple permutations allow the same number, perhaps choose the one that ends earliest or starts latest, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe just the first one found.\n\nBut wait, permutations might not be the most efficient way. Maybe a backtracking approach where we try to add each possible next meeting, considering the current time and location, and see if it fits.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of friends is small (5), I can generate all possible orders and for each, try to fit the meetings, keeping track of the best solution.\n\nSo first, I'll generate all possible permutations of the friends. For each permutation, I'll attempt to schedule the meetings in that order, starting from Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. For each meeting, I'll calculate the earliest possible start time, considering travel from the previous location and the meeting duration. If the meeting can fit within the friend's available time slot, I'll proceed. If any meeting in the permutation can't be scheduled, I'll move to the next permutation.\n\nI'll keep track of the best schedule found so far, which is the one that includes the most friends. If multiple schedules have the same number, perhaps the one that ends earlier is better, but the problem doesn't specify, so I'll just take the first one that meets the maximum.\n\nLet me think about the data structures:\n\n- Travel times: a dictionary of dictionaries. For example, travel_times['Fisherman's Wharf']['Bayview'] = 26.\n- Friends: a list of dictionaries, each with 'name', 'location', 'start', 'end', 'duration'.\n\nI'll need to convert the time strings into minutes since midnight for easier calculations. For example, '9:00' becomes 540 minutes (9*60), '13:30' is 810, etc.\n\nNow, the algorithm steps:\n\n1. Initialize the current schedule as empty, current time as 9:00 AM (540 minutes), and current location as Fisherman's Wharf.\n2. For each permutation of friends:\n   a. Reset current time and location.\n   b. For each friend in the permutation order:\n      i. Calculate the travel time from current location to friend's location.\n      ii. Determine the earliest possible arrival time: current_time + travel_time.\n      iii. Check if the friend is available at or after arrival time, and if the meeting can fit within their available time.\n      iv. If yes, schedule the meeting from max(arrival_time, friend's start time) to max(arrival_time, friend's start time) + meeting duration. But wait, the meeting must be at least the minimum duration. So the end time must be start_time + duration, and this end time must be <= friend's end time.\n      v. If the meeting can be scheduled, add it to the tentative schedule, update current time and location.\n      vi. If not, break this permutation and try the next.\n   c. If all friends in the permutation are scheduled, check if this is the best schedule so far (more friends than previous best). If so, update the best schedule.\n3. After evaluating all permutations, output the best schedule.\n\nWait, but some friends might have overlapping time slots, so the order in which we meet them matters. For example, meeting someone earlier might allow more time for others later.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nI'll need to:\n\n- Parse the travel times into a dictionary.\n- Parse the friends' data into a list.\n- Generate all possible permutations of the friends.\n- For each permutation, attempt to create a schedule.\n- Keep track of the best schedule.\n\nBut wait, the friends have different required durations. So for each meeting, the duration is fixed. So when scheduling, the meeting must last at least that duration.\n\nAlso, the travel time between locations must be considered. So after each meeting, the next meeting's start time is the previous meeting's end time plus the travel time to the next location.\n\nBut wait, the next meeting can't start before the friend's available start time. So the start time is the maximum of (previous end time + travel time) and the friend's start time.\n\nWait, no. The start time for the meeting is the earliest possible time you can arrive at the friend's location, which is the previous end time plus travel time. But the meeting can't start before the friend's available start time. So the meeting starts at max(arrival_time, friend's start_time) and ends at that start time plus the required duration. But this end time must be <= friend's end time.\n\nSo, for each friend in the permutation:\n\narrival_time = current_end_time + travel_time from current_location to friend's location.\n\nmeeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend.start_time)\n\nmeeting_end = meeting_start + friend.duration\n\nif meeting_end <= friend.end_time:\n\n   schedule this meeting.\n\n   current_end_time = meeting_end\n\n   current_location = friend.location\n\nelse:\n\n   can't schedule this friend in this permutation.\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation, I'll loop through each friend, calculate arrival time, then see if the meeting can fit.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nFirst, I'll read the travel times. The input is a list of lines, each with from, to, time. So I'll parse each line into the travel_times dictionary.\n\nThen, I'll create the friends list. Each friend has name, location, start time, end time, and required duration.\n\nWait, looking back at the constraints:\n\nThomas: Bayview, 3:30PM to 6:30PM, 120 mins.\n\nStephanie: Golden Gate Park, 6:30PM to 9:45PM, 30 mins.\n\nLaura: Nob Hill, 8:45AM to 4:15PM, 30 mins.\n\nBetty: Marina District, 6:45PM to 9:45PM, 45 mins.\n\nPatricia: Embarcadero, 5:30PM to 10:00PM, 45 mins.\n\nWait, but 3:30PM is 15:30, which is 15*60 +30= 930 minutes. Similarly, 6:30PM is 18:30=1110 mins, etc.\n\nSo I'll convert all times to minutes since midnight.\n\nSo friends list would be:\n\n[\n    {'name': 'Thomas', 'location': 'Bayview', 'start': 930, 'end': 1110, 'duration': 120},\n    {'name': 'Stephanie', 'location': 'Golden Gate Park', 'start': 1110, 'end': 1305, 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Laura', 'location': 'Nob Hill', 'start': 525, 'end': 975, 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Betty', 'location': 'Marina District', 'start': 1145, 'end': 1305, 'duration': 45},\n    {'name': 'Patricia', 'location': 'Embarcadero', 'start': 1020, 'end': 1380, 'duration': 45},\n]\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n- 3:30PM is 15:30 \u2192 15*60 +30=930.\n- 6:30PM is 18:30 \u2192 1110.\n- 9:45PM is 21:45 \u2192 1305.\n- 8:45AM is 8*60 +45=525.\n- 4:15PM is 16:15 \u2192 975.\n- 6:45PM is 18:45 \u2192 18*60+45=1145.\n- 5:30PM is 17:30 \u2192 1050? Wait, wait: 5:30PM is 17:30, which is 17*60+30=1050. But Patricia's start is 5:30PM, so 1050. End is 10:00PM \u2192 22:00 \u2192 1320.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, Patricia is available from 5:30PM (17:30) to 10:00PM (22:00). So in minutes, that's 1050 to 1200? Wait no, 10:00PM is 22*60=1320.\n\nWait, 10:00PM is 22:00, which is 22*60=1320.\n\nSo Patricia's end time is 1320.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo friends:\n\nThomas: 930-1110, 120 mins.\n\nStephanie: 1110-1305, 30.\n\nLaura: 525-975, 30.\n\nBetty: 1145-1305, 45.\n\nPatricia: 1050-1320, 45.\n\nSo the friends list is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nI'll need to import itertools to generate permutations.\n\nThen, for each permutation of the friends, attempt to schedule.\n\nI'll also need a function to convert time in minutes back to HH:MM format for the output.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Read the travel times and build the travel_times dictionary.\n\n2. Create the friends list with their details.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the friends.\n\n4. For each permutation:\n\n   a. Initialize current_time to 540 (9:00 AM), current_location to 'Fisherman's Wharf'.\n\n   b. Initialize the itinerary for this permutation as empty.\n\n   c. For each friend in the permutation:\n\n      i. Calculate travel_time from current_location to friend's location. If current_location is not in travel_times, or friend's location is not a key, perhaps raise an error, but assuming the data is correct.\n\n      ii. arrival_time = current_time + travel_time.\n\n      iii. meeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend['start']).\n\n      iv. meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration'].\n\n      v. If meeting_end > friend['end'], then can't meet this friend in this permutation. Break and try next permutation.\n\n      vi. Else, add this meeting to the itinerary, update current_time to meeting_end, current_location to friend['location'].\n\n   d. After processing all friends in the permutation, if the number of meetings is greater than the current best, update the best itinerary.\n\n5. After all permutations are processed, output the best itinerary in the required JSON format.\n\nBut wait, the number of permutations is 5! = 120, which is manageable.\n\nNow, some edge cases:\n\n- A friend's available time might be before the arrival time. For example, if a friend is available until 10:00 AM, but we arrive at 11:00 AM, we can't meet.\n\n- The meeting duration might cause the meeting to end after the friend's available end time. So, in that case, we can't meet.\n\n- Travel times might be such that even if the friend is available, the arrival time is after the friend's end time minus the required duration.\n\nSo, the code must handle these cases.\n\nAnother consideration: the order in which friends are met can affect whether others can be met. For example, meeting someone far away early might make it impossible to reach others on time.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the travel times. The given data includes travel times from each location to others. So for example, Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26, and Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25. So the travel_times dictionary should have both directions.\n\nI'll structure it as a nested dictionary, where travel_times[from_loc][to_loc] = time.\n\nSo, in code, I'll read each line, split into from, to, time, and populate the dictionary.\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\n\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\n\nFisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25.\n\n... and so on.\n\nSo, in the code, I'll need to parse each line into from_location, to_location, time.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the code is supposed to take the input as variables, but in this case, the code is to be written with the given data. So perhaps the code will have the travel_times dictionary hardcoded.\n\nSo, I'll create the travel_times dictionary manually.\n\nLet me list all the travel times:\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf:\n\n- Bayview:26\n\n- Golden Gate Park:25\n\n- Nob Hill:11\n\n- Marina District:9\n\n- Embarcadero:8\n\nFrom Bayview:\n\n- Fisherman's Wharf:25\n\n- Golden Gate Park:22\n\n- Nob Hill:20\n\n- Marina District:25\n\n- Embarcadero:19\n\nFrom Golden Gate Park:\n\n- Fisherman's Wharf:24\n\n- Bayview:23\n\n- Nob Hill:20\n\n- Marina District:16\n\n- Embarcadero:25\n\nFrom Nob Hill:\n\n- Fisherman's Wharf:11\n\n- Bayview:19\n\n- Golden Gate Park:17\n\n- Marina District:11\n\n- Embarcadero:9\n\nFrom Marina District:\n\n- Fisherman's Wharf:10\n\n- Bayview:27\n\n- Golden Gate Park:18\n\n- Nob Hill:12\n\n- Embarcadero:14\n\nFrom Embarcadero:\n\n- Fisherman's Wharf:6\n\n- Bayview:21\n\n- Golden Gate Park:25\n\n- Nob Hill:10\n\n- Marina District:12\n\nSo, in code, I'll create the travel_times dictionary accordingly.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nImport necessary modules: itertools for permutations, and json for output.\n\nDefine the travel_times dictionary.\n\nDefine the friends list.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the friends.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   current_time = 540 (9:00 AM)\n\n   current_location = 'Fisherman's Wharf'\n\n   itinerary = []\n\n   for friend in permutation:\n\n       # Get travel time from current_location to friend's location\n\n       travel = travel_times[current_location][friend['location']]\n\n       arrival = current_time + travel\n\n       meeting_start = max(arrival, friend['start'])\n\n       meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n\n       if meeting_end > friend['end']:\n\n           # Can't meet this friend, break permutation\n\n           break\n\n       # Add to itinerary\n\n       itinerary.append({\n\n           'action': 'meet',\n\n           'location': friend['location'],\n\n           'person': friend['name'],\n\n           'start_time': convert_time(meeting_start),\n\n           'end_time': convert_time(meeting_end)\n\n       })\n\n       # Update current time and location\n\n       current_time = meeting_end\n\n       current_location = friend['location']\n\n   else:\n\n       # All friends in permutation were scheduled\n\n       # Check if this is the best so far\n\n       if len(itinerary) > best_count:\n\n           best_itinerary = itinerary\n\n           best_count = len(itinerary)\n\nSo, the code will loop through each permutation, try to schedule each friend in order, and if all are scheduled, compare to the best found.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each permutation, we process each friend in order, and if any can't be scheduled, we break and move to the next permutation. If all are scheduled, we check if it's better than the current best.\n\nNow, the function to convert minutes to time string:\n\ndef convert_time(minutes):\n\n    hours = minutes // 60\n\n    mins = minutes % 60\n\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nWait, but the problem says times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero). Wait, but 9:00 is '9:00', not '09:00'. So for hours less than 10, we don't want a leading zero.\n\nSo the function should return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\" but for hours, just as is.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n540 minutes \u2192 9:00 \u2192 '9:00'\n\n930 \u2192 15:30 \u2192 '15:30'\n\nSo the function can be:\n\ndef convert_time(minutes):\n\n    hours = minutes // 60\n\n    mins = minutes % 60\n\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nBut wait, in Python, if hours is 9, it's '9', which is correct.\n\nSo that's fine.\n\nNow, the initial best_itinerary is empty, best_count is 0.\n\nAfter processing all permutations, output the best_itinerary as JSON.\n\nBut wait, the output is a JSON object with an 'itinerary' key, which is a list of the meetings.\n\nSo, the final output is:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    { ... }, { ... }, ...\n  ]\n}\n\nSo, in code, after finding the best_itinerary, we'll create a dictionary with 'itinerary' as the key, and the list as the value.\n\nNow, what about the order of the meetings? Since we're considering all permutations, the code will find the permutation that allows the maximum number of meetings.\n\nBut perhaps some permutations allow meeting all 5 friends, others less.\n\nSo the code will find the best possible.\n\nNow, let's think about possible issues.\n\nOne issue is that the code may not find any valid permutation, but given the constraints, it's likely that some meetings can be scheduled.\n\nAnother issue is the order in which permutations are generated. Since itertools.permutations returns them in a certain order, the first permutation that meets the maximum number of friends will be the one used. If multiple permutations have the same number, the first one found is used.\n\nBut the problem says to find the optimal schedule, which is the one that meets as many as possible. So the code correctly captures that.\n\nNow, let's think about an example.\n\nSuppose the optimal schedule is:\n\nMeet Laura first, then Patricia, then Thomas, then Betty, then Stephanie.\n\nBut the code will try all possible orders.\n\nAnother consideration: when a permutation allows meeting 4 friends, but another allows 5, the code will correctly choose the 5.\n\nNow, I'll write the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, I need to handle the case where the current_location is not in the travel_times or the friend's location is not a key. But since all friends' locations are present in the travel_times, and the starting location is Fisherman's Wharf, which is also present, this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules.\n\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\nThen, define the travel_times.\n\ntravel_times = {\n    'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': {\n        'Bayview': 26,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 25,\n        'Nob Hill': 11,\n        'Marina District': 9,\n        'Embarcadero': 8\n    },\n    'Bayview': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 25,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 22,\n        'Nob Hill': 20,\n        'Marina District': 25,\n        'Embarcadero': 19\n    },\n    'Golden Gate Park': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 24,\n        'Bayview': 23,\n        'Nob Hill': 20,\n        'Marina District': 16,\n        'Embarcadero': 25\n    },\n    'Nob Hill': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 11,\n        'Bayview': 19,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 17,\n        'Marina District': 11,\n        'Embarcadero': 9\n    },\n    'Marina District': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 10,\n        'Bayview': 27,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 18,\n        'Nob Hill': 12,\n        'Embarcadero': 14\n    },\n    'Embarcadero': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 6,\n        'Bayview': 21,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 25,\n        'Nob Hill': 10,\n        'Marina District': 12\n    }\n}\n\nThen, define the friends.\n\nfriends = [\n    {'name': 'Thomas', 'location': 'Bayview', 'start': 930, 'end': 1110, 'duration': 120},\n    {'name': 'Stephanie', 'location': 'Golden Gate Park', 'start': 1110, 'end': 1305, 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Laura', 'location': 'Nob Hill', 'start': 525, 'end': 975, 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Betty', 'location': 'Marina District', 'start': 1145, 'end': 1305, 'duration': 45},\n    {'name': 'Patricia', 'location': 'Embarcadero', 'start': 1050, 'end': 1320, 'duration': 45}\n]\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check the times.\n\nThomas: 3:30PM (15:30) to 6:30PM (18:30) \u2192 930 to 1110.\n\nStephanie: 6:30PM (18:30) to 9:45PM (21:45) \u2192 1110 to 1305.\n\nLaura: 8:45AM (8:45) to 4:15PM (16:15) \u2192 525 to 975.\n\nBetty: 6:45PM (18:45) to 9:45PM (21:45) \u2192 1145 to 1305.\n\nPatricia: 5:30PM (17:30) to 10:00PM (22:00) \u2192 1050 to 1320.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the function to convert minutes to time string.\n\ndef convert_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nNow, the main logic.\n\nbest_itinerary = []\nbest_count = 0\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n    current_loc = 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'\n    itinerary = []\n    \n    for friend in perm:\n        # Get travel time\n        travel = travel_times[current_loc][friend['location']]\n        arrival = current_time + travel\n        \n        # Calculate meeting start and end\n        meeting_start = max(arrival, friend['start'])\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n        \n        if meeting_end > friend['end']:\n            # Can't meet this friend in this permutation\n            break\n        \n        # Add to itinerary\n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': convert_time(meeting_start),\n            'end_time': convert_time(meeting_end)\n        })\n        \n        # Update current time and location\n        current_time = meeting_end\n        current_loc = friend['location']\n    \n    else:\n        # All friends in permutation were processed without breaking\n        if len(itinerary) > best_count:\n            best_itinerary = itinerary\n            best_count = len(itinerary)\n\n# Prepare the output\noutput = {\n    \"itinerary\": best_itinerary\n}\n\n# Print the JSON\nprint(json.dumps(output, indent=2))\n\nWait, but the code as written will only process the first permutation that meets the maximum number of friends. However, there might be multiple permutations that meet the same number of friends, but the code will only keep the first one. That's acceptable since the problem doesn't specify any further optimization.\n\nBut wait, the code initializes best_itinerary as an empty list, and best_count as 0. For each permutation, if the itinerary is longer, it updates. So the code correctly finds the permutation that allows the maximum number of meetings.\n\nNow, let's test this code with the given constraints.\n\nBut wait, the code is supposed to output the JSON when run. So when I run this code, it should print the JSON.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says that the code must compute the plan using the given parameters, not just print a pre-determined answer. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the friends are hardcoded. So when the code is run, it uses the given data. So it's correct.\n\nNow, let me think about possible issues.\n\nOne issue is that the code doesn't handle cases where a friend's location is the same as the current location. For example, if the current location is already the friend's location, the travel time is zero, which is correct.\n\nAnother consideration: the code doesn't account for the possibility that a friend's available time starts before the arrival time but ends after. For example, if arrival is 1000, friend's start is 900, end is 1100, and duration is 30. Then meeting starts at 1000, ends at 1030, which is within the friend's time.\n\nYes, the code correctly handles that.\n\nAnother case: if arrival is 500 (8:20 AM), friend's start is 525 (8:45 AM), duration 30. So meeting starts at 525, ends at 555 (9:15 AM), which is within the friend's availability (assuming friend's end is after 555).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, I think the code is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal meeting schedule that allows meeting as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering their availability and travel times between locations. The goal is to find a schedule that maximizes the number of meetings while respecting all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: We start by defining the travel times between different locations in San Francisco using a nested dictionary. Each key in the dictionary represents a starting location, and its value is another dictionary mapping destination locations to travel times in minutes.\n\n2. **Friend Availability**: We define a list of friends, each with their name, location, available start and end times, and the minimum meeting duration.\n\n3. **Permutations of Meetings**: Since the number of friends is small (5), we generate all possible permutations of these friends. Each permutation represents a potential order in which to meet the friends.\n\n4. **Scheduling Meetings**: For each permutation, we attempt to schedule meetings starting from Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. For each friend in the permutation:\n   - Calculate the travel time from the current location to the friend's location.\n   - Determine the earliest possible start time for the meeting, which is the maximum of the arrival time and the friend's available start time.\n   - Check if the meeting can fit within the friend's available time slot. If yes, update the current time and location. If not, discard this permutation and try the next one.\n\n5. **Optimal Schedule**: Track the best schedule found, which is the one that allows meeting the maximum number of friends. If multiple schedules allow the same number of meetings, the first one found is chosen.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\n# Define travel times between locations in minutes\ntravel_times = {\n    'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': {\n        'Bayview': 26,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 25,\n        'Nob Hill': 11,\n        'Marina District': 9,\n        'Embarcadero': 8\n    },\n    'Bayview': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 25,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 22,\n        'Nob Hill': 20,\n        'Marina District': 25,\n        'Embarcadero': 19\n    },\n    'Golden Gate Park': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 24,\n        'Bayview': 23,\n        'Nob Hill': 20,\n        'Marina District': 16,\n        'Embarcadero': 25\n    },\n    'Nob Hill': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 11,\n        'Bayview': 19,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 17,\n        'Marina District': 11,\n        'Embarcadero': 9\n    },\n    'Marina District': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 10,\n        'Bayview': 27,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 18,\n        'Nob Hill': 12,\n        'Embarcadero': 14\n    },\n    'Embarcadero': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 6,\n        'Bayview': 21,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 25,\n        'Nob Hill': 10,\n        'Marina District': 12\n    }\n}\n\n# Define friends with their constraints\nfriends = [\n    {'name': 'Thomas', 'location': 'Bayview', 'start': 930, 'end': 1110, 'duration': 120},\n    {'name': 'Stephanie', 'location': 'Golden Gate Park', 'start': 1110, 'end': 1305, 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Laura', 'location': 'Nob Hill', 'start': 525, 'end': 975, 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Betty', 'location': 'Marina District', 'start': 1145, 'end': 1305, 'duration': 45},\n    {'name': 'Patricia', 'location': 'Embarcadero', 'start': 1050, 'end': 1320, 'duration': 45}\n]\n\ndef convert_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nbest_itinerary = []\nbest_count = 0\n\n# Generate all possible permutations of friends\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_time = 540  # Starting at 9:00 AM\n    current_loc = 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'\n    itinerary = []\n    \n    for friend in perm:\n        # Calculate travel time to friend's location\n        travel = travel_times[current_loc][friend['location']]\n        arrival = current_time + travel\n        \n        # Determine meeting start and end times\n        meeting_start = max(arrival, friend['start'])\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n        \n        # Check if the meeting can be scheduled\n        if meeting_end > friend['end']:\n            break  # Cannot meet this friend, proceed to next permutation\n        \n        # Add the meeting to the itinerary\n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': convert_time(meeting_start),\n            'end_time': convert_time(meeting_end)\n        })\n        \n        # Update current time and location for next meeting\n        current_time = meeting_end\n        current_loc = friend['location']\n    \n    else:\n        # All friends in permutation were successfully scheduled\n        if len(itinerary) > best_count:\n            best_itinerary = itinerary\n            best_count = len(itinerary)\n\n# Prepare the output\noutput = {\n    \"itinerary\": best_itinerary\n}\n\n# Print the result as JSON\nprint(json.dumps(output, indent=2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code starts by defining the travel times between various locations in San Francisco. It then lists each friend's availability, including their location, start and end times, and the minimum meeting duration. Using permutations, the code explores all possible orders of meeting friends. For each permutation, it calculates the earliest possible start time for each meeting, considering travel times and friend availability. The optimal schedule is determined by the permutation that allows meeting the maximum number of friends, and the result is printed in JSON format.",
