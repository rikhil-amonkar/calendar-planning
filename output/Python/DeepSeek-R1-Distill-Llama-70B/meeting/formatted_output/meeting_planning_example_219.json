            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to create a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule for the user. The user is in San Francisco and wants to meet as many friends as possible, considering their availability and the travel times between locations.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem thoroughly. The user arrives at The Castro at 9:00 AM. They have three friends they want to meet:\n\n1. Emily is at Alamo Square from 11:45 AM to 3:15 PM, and they want to meet her for at least 105 minutes.\n2. Barbara is at Union Square from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM, requiring a 60-minute meeting.\n3. William is at Chinatown from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM, needing at least 105 minutes.\n\nThe goal is to find a schedule that allows meeting all three friends, considering the travel times between locations. If it's not possible to meet all, then prioritize based on the order of importance, but I think the problem expects to meet as many as possible, so maybe all three.\n\nI'll need to model the possible movements between locations, considering the time constraints and the required meeting durations.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Define the travel times between each pair of locations.** I'll create a dictionary where each key is a tuple of (from_location, to_location) and the value is the travel time in minutes.\n\n2. **Define the friends' availability and meeting requirements.** Each friend has a location, a start time, an end time, and a required meeting duration.\n\n3. **Generate possible itineraries.** The user starts at The Castro at 9:00 AM. From there, they can choose to go to any of the friends' locations, but considering the friends' availability.\n\nWait, but the friends are available at different times. So, the user needs to plan the order of meetings such that they can arrive on time for each meeting, considering travel times and the required duration.\n\nI think the approach should be to consider all possible orders of meeting the friends and check which order is feasible. Since there are three friends, there are 3! = 6 possible orders. For each order, we'll check if it's possible to meet all friends in that sequence without violating their time constraints.\n\nBut perhaps the user can't meet all three, so we might need to check all possible subsets as well. However, the problem statement implies that the user wants to meet as many as possible, so perhaps the optimal solution includes all three if possible.\n\nLet me think about the possible sequences.\n\nPossible sequences could be:\n\n1. Emily \u2192 Barbara \u2192 William\n2. Emily \u2192 William \u2192 Barbara\n3. Barbara \u2192 Emily \u2192 William\n4. Barbara \u2192 William \u2192 Emily\n5. William \u2192 Emily \u2192 Barbara\n6. William \u2192 Barbara \u2192 Emily\n\nBut considering the time slots:\n\n- Emily is available from 11:45 to 15:15 (3:15 PM).\n- Barbara from 16:45 (4:45 PM) to 18:15 (6:15 PM).\n- William from 17:15 (5:15 PM) to 19:00 (7:00 PM).\n\nSo, Emily's slot ends at 3:15 PM, which is before Barbara's starts at 4:45 PM. Barbara's ends at 6:15 PM, and William's starts at 5:15 PM, which overlaps with Barbara's time. So, if the user meets Barbara first, they might have to leave before Barbara's end time to reach William, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but Barbara's meeting requires only 60 minutes, so perhaps the user can meet her for an hour and then go to William. Similarly, William needs 105 minutes, so the user needs to arrive early enough to meet him for that duration.\n\nLet me try to plan a possible itinerary.\n\nOption 1: Meet Emily first, then Barbara, then William.\n\n- Start at Castro at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Alamo Square: 8 minutes. Arrive at 9:08 AM.\n- But Emily is only available from 11:45 AM. So the user can't meet her before that. So perhaps the user can stay in Castro until 11:45 AM, but that's a lot of waiting time. Alternatively, maybe the user can go elsewhere and come back, but that might not be efficient.\n\nWait, but the user is free until they decide to go to a meeting location. So, perhaps the optimal is to go to Emily as early as possible, but she's only available starting at 11:45 AM.\n\nSo, the earliest the user can arrive at Alamo Square is 9:08 AM, but Emily isn't there until 11:45. So the user could wait there, but that's a lot of time. Alternatively, perhaps the user can go to another location first, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should first meet Emily at the earliest possible time, which is 11:45 AM.\n\nSo, let's plan:\n\n- Leave Castro at 9:00 AM to Alamo Square: 8 minutes, arrive at 9:08 AM. But Emily isn't available until 11:45. So the user has to wait until 11:45 to meet her.\n\nBut that's a lot of waiting time. Alternatively, perhaps the user can go somewhere else first, but that might not be better because other friends are available later.\n\nWait, but the user can't meet anyone else before 11:45 except Emily. So perhaps the best is to go to Alamo Square, wait until 11:45, meet Emily for 105 minutes, then proceed.\n\nSo:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Castro\n- 9:08 AM: arrive Alamo Square\n- Wait until 11:45 AM to meet Emily\n- Meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM (105 minutes)\n- Then, need to go to Barbara or William.\n\nAfter meeting Emily, the next possible is Barbara, who is available from 4:45 PM. So after 1:30 PM, the user can travel to Union Square.\n\nTravel time from Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 minutes. So arrive at 1:44 PM. But Barbara is only available from 4:45 PM. So the user would have to wait until 4:45 PM.\n\nThen meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM (60 minutes). Then, go to William.\n\nFrom Union Square to Chinatown: 7 minutes. Arrive at 5:52 PM. William is available from 5:15 PM, so the user can meet him from 5:52 PM until 7:37 PM, but William is only available until 7:00 PM. So the meeting would have to end by 7:00 PM, which gives only 68 minutes, which is less than the required 105 minutes. So that's a problem.\n\nSo this sequence (Emily \u2192 Barbara \u2192 William) might not work because William's meeting would be too short.\n\nAlternative approach: After meeting Emily, go to William first, then Barbara.\n\nWait, but Barbara is available from 4:45 PM, and William from 5:15 PM. So perhaps after Emily, go to William, then Barbara.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nAfter Emily, at 1:30 PM, leave Alamo Square to Chinatown. The travel time from Alamo Square to Chinatown is 16 minutes. So arrive at 1:46 PM. William is available from 5:15 PM, so the user would have to wait until 5:15 PM. Then meet William for 105 minutes, until 6:60 PM, which is 7:00 PM. But William is available until 7:00 PM, so that works.\n\nThen, from Chinatown, go to Union Square. Travel time is 7 minutes, arrive at 7:07 PM. But Barbara's availability ends at 6:15 PM, so the user arrives too late. So that's a problem.\n\nSo this sequence (Emily \u2192 William \u2192 Barbara) allows meeting Emily and William, but misses Barbara.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can meet Barbara before William.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nAfter Emily, at 1:30 PM, the user can go to Union Square.\n\nTravel time from Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 minutes. Arrive at 1:44 PM. Barbara is available from 4:45 PM, so wait until then.\n\nMeet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM (60 minutes). Then, go to Chinatown.\n\nTravel time from Union Square to Chinatown is 7 minutes. Arrive at 5:52 PM. William is available until 7:00 PM, so the user can meet him from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM, which is 68 minutes. That's less than the required 105 minutes. So that's not enough.\n\nSo, perhaps the user can't meet all three in this order.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe meet Barbara first, then William, then Emily.\n\nBut Emily is only available until 3:15 PM. So if the user goes to Barbara first, which starts at 4:45 PM, they would miss Emily's availability.\n\nSo that's not possible.\n\nAnother option: Meet William first, but he's available from 5:15 PM. So the user would have to go to Chinatown, but that's far from Castro.\n\nTravel time from Castro to Chinatown is 20 minutes. So arrive at 9:20 AM. But William isn't available until 5:15 PM. So the user would have to wait until then, which is a lot of time. Then meet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 minutes). Then, go to Barbara.\n\nFrom Chinatown to Union Square: 7 minutes. Arrive at 7:07 PM. Barbara's availability ends at 6:15 PM, so too late. Then, go to Emily: but she's only available until 3:15 PM, so also too late. So this sequence is bad.\n\nSo perhaps the only way is to meet Emily and Barbara, but not William, or Emily and William but not Barbara.\n\nWait, let me check another possibility.\n\nWhat if the user meets Emily, then goes to William, but starts the meeting with William earlier?\n\nWait, after Emily ends at 1:30 PM, the user can go to William.\n\nFrom Alamo Square to Chinatown: 16 minutes. Arrive at 1:46 PM. But William is available from 5:15 PM. So the user has to wait until 5:15 PM. Then meet William until 7:00 PM. That's 105 minutes. Then, from Chinatown, go to Union Square (7 minutes) arrive at 7:07 PM, which is after Barbara's end time. So Barbara is missed.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Emily, the user could go to Union Square, wait for Barbara, meet her, and then try to go to William.\n\nAs before, that gives 68 minutes with William, which is insufficient.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the user can't meet all three friends. Then, the next step is to see which two can be met.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user can adjust the meeting times to fit.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the user can meet Emily for a shorter time, but the problem states a minimum of 105 minutes. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can start meeting Emily earlier, but she's only available from 11:45 AM.\n\nWait, the user arrives at Alamo Square at 9:08 AM, but Emily isn't there until 11:45. So the user has to wait until then.\n\nSo the earliest Emily can be met is 11:45 AM for 105 minutes, ending at 1:30 PM.\n\nAfter that, the user has to choose between going to Barbara or William.\n\nIf the user goes to Barbara next, they arrive at 1:44 PM, wait until 4:45 PM, meet her until 5:45 PM, then go to William, arriving at 5:52 PM. Meet him until 7:00 PM, which is 68 minutes, less than required.\n\nAlternatively, after Emily, go directly to William. Arrive at 1:46 PM, wait until 5:15 PM. Meet him until 7:00 PM. Then, go to Barbara, but she's no longer available.\n\nSo, in this case, the user can meet Emily and William, but not Barbara.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Barbara for a shorter time, but the problem requires a minimum of 60 minutes. So 60 minutes is acceptable. Wait, but in the previous scenario, after meeting William, the user arrives at Union Square at 7:07 PM, which is after Barbara's end time of 6:15 PM. So that's too late.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Barbara before William. Let me see.\n\nAfter Emily ends at 1:30 PM, the user goes to Union Square, arriving at 1:44 PM. Then, they can wait until 4:45 PM to meet Barbara for 60 minutes, ending at 5:45 PM. Then, go to Chinatown, arriving at 5:52 PM. Now, William is available until 7:00 PM. So the user can meet him from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM, which is 68 minutes, which is less than the required 105. So that's not enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can adjust the meeting with Barbara to end earlier so that they can reach William earlier.\n\nWait, Barbara's meeting is from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM. The user needs to meet her for at least 60 minutes. So the latest they can start is 5:15 PM (to end by 6:15 PM). So, if the user arrives at 4:45 PM, they can meet her from 4:45 to 5:45 PM, then leave for William.\n\nTravel time to Chinatown is 7 minutes, arrive at 5:52 PM. Then, meet William until 7:00 PM, which is 68 minutes. Still insufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Barbara for exactly 60 minutes, from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, then go to William.\n\nBut Barbara is available until 6:15 PM, so that's acceptable. Then, the user leaves at 6:00 PM, arrives at Chinatown at 6:07 PM. Then, meets William from 6:07 PM to 7:52 PM, but William is only available until 7:00 PM. So that's 53 minutes, which is still less than required.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the user can meet Barbara for a shorter time, but the problem states a minimum of 60 minutes, so that's acceptable as long as it's at least 60. But in this case, even 60 minutes would require arriving by 5:15 PM to meet William for 105 minutes (until 7:00 PM). Let me check:\n\nIf the user meets Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM, then leaves for William. Arrive at 5:52 PM. Then, William's meeting would be from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM, which is 68 minutes. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, what if the user meets Barbara from 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM (exactly 60 minutes), then leaves for William. Arrive at 6:22 PM. Then, William's meeting would be from 6:22 PM to 7:00 PM, which is 38 minutes. Not enough.\n\nSo, perhaps it's impossible to meet both Barbara and William after Emily.\n\nSo, the user has to choose between meeting Emily and Barbara, or Emily and William.\n\nWhich option allows meeting two friends?\n\nIf the user meets Emily and Barbara, the total time spent is 105 + 60 = 165 minutes. Plus travel times.\n\nAlternatively, if the user meets Emily and William, that's 105 + 105 = 210 minutes, plus travel times.\n\nBut considering the time available, perhaps Emily and William can be met.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nMeet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM (105 mins).\n\nThen, go to William: travel time from Alamo Square to Chinatown is 16 mins. Arrive at 1:46 PM.\n\nWait until 5:15 PM to meet William. So, 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 mins).\n\nThen, after that, go to Barbara, but she's only available until 6:15 PM, which is before 7:00 PM. So that's too late.\n\nSo, in this case, the user can meet Emily and William, but not Barbara.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to meet Barbara and William after Emily?\n\nWait, if after Emily, the user goes to Barbara, meets her for 60 mins, then goes to William.\n\nBut as calculated earlier, that only allows 68 mins with William, which is insufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal is to meet Emily and William, but not Barbara.\n\nBut wait, Barbara's meeting is only 60 mins, which is shorter. Maybe the user can adjust the schedule to fit both.\n\nWait, perhaps after meeting Emily, instead of waiting until 5:15 PM for William, the user can go to Barbara first, meet her for 60 mins, then go to William.\n\nLet me see:\n\nAfter Emily ends at 1:30 PM, the user goes to Union Square (14 mins), arrives at 1:44 PM.\n\nThen, wait until 4:45 PM to meet Barbara (4:45 PM to 5:45 PM).\n\nThen, go to Chinatown (7 mins), arrive at 5:52 PM.\n\nThen, meet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM (68 mins). Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, meet Barbara from 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM (60 mins), then go to William, arriving at 6:22 PM. Then meet him until 7:00 PM (38 mins). Not enough.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the user can meet Barbara for a shorter time but still meet the 60-minute requirement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"a minimum of 60 minutes\", so 60 is acceptable. So, perhaps the user can meet Barbara from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, then go to William.\n\nLeaving Union Square at 6:00 PM, arrive at Chinatown at 6:07 PM. Then meet William until 7:00 PM (53 mins). Still insufficient.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the user can meet Barbara earlier. Let's see: after Emily ends at 1:30 PM, the user goes to Union Square, arriving at 1:44 PM. Then, they can meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM. Then, go to William.\n\nBut that gives only 68 mins with William.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Barbara for exactly 60 mins, but start earlier.\n\nWait, Barbara is available from 4:45 PM onwards. So the user can meet her any time after 4:45 PM, as long as it's at least 60 mins.\n\nSo, if the user arrives at Union Square at 1:44 PM, they can wait until 4:45 PM, meet Barbara until 5:45 PM, then go to William.\n\nBut as before, that leaves only 68 mins for William.\n\nSo, perhaps the user can't meet both Barbara and William after Emily.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the user can meet Emily and either Barbara or William, but not all three.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user can adjust the order.\n\nWait, what if the user meets William first, but that would require going to Chinatown early, which is far from Castro.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nStart at Castro at 9:00 AM.\n\nTravel to Chinatown: 20 mins, arrive at 9:20 AM.\n\nWait until 5:15 PM to meet William. That's a long wait, but let's proceed.\n\nMeet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 mins).\n\nThen, go to Union Square (7 mins), arrive at 7:07 PM. Barbara's availability ends at 6:15 PM, so too late.\n\nThen, go to Alamo Square (16 mins from Chinatown), arrive at 7:23 PM. Emily's availability ended at 3:15 PM, so too late.\n\nSo, in this case, the user can only meet William.\n\nThat's worse than meeting Emily and William.\n\nSo, the best option seems to be meeting Emily and William.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n\n- Meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM.\n\n- Then, go to William, arriving at 1:46 PM, wait until 5:15 PM, meet him until 7:00 PM.\n\nBut that leaves Barbara out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Emily, then Barbara, but that only allows 68 mins with William.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal is to meet Emily and William.\n\nBut the problem says the user wants to meet as many friends as possible. So, perhaps the user can meet all three if they adjust the meeting times.\n\nWait, maybe the user can meet Emily for 105 mins, then go to Barbara, meet her for 60 mins, and then go to William, but adjust the times so that the meeting with William starts earlier.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\nAfter Emily ends at 1:30 PM, the user goes to Union Square (14 mins), arrives at 1:44 PM.\n\nThen, wait until 4:45 PM to meet Barbara (4:45 PM to 5:45 PM).\n\nThen, go to Chinatown (7 mins), arrive at 5:52 PM.\n\nMeet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM: 68 mins. Not enough.\n\nBut what if the user meets Barbara for exactly 60 mins, but starts earlier? Like, from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM, as before.\n\nNo, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Barbara from 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM, but that's 60 mins, and then go to William.\n\nLeaving at 6:15 PM, arrive at Chinatown at 6:22 PM. Meet William from 6:22 PM to 7:00 PM: 38 mins. Not enough.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the user can meet Emily, then go directly to William, meet him for 105 mins, then go to Barbara.\n\nBut Barbara's availability ends at 6:15 PM.\n\nSo, after meeting William until 7:00 PM, the user arrives at Union Square at 7:07 PM, which is after Barbara's end time.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Emily, then go to William, but start the meeting earlier.\n\nWait, after Emily ends at 1:30 PM, the user goes to Chinatown, arriving at 1:46 PM. They can't meet William until 5:15 PM. So, that's a lot of waiting time.\n\nBut maybe the user can go to Union Square first, meet Barbara, then go to William.\n\nWait, after Emily ends at 1:30 PM, the user goes to Union Square (14 mins), arrives at 1:44 PM. Then, wait until 4:45 PM to meet Barbara (4:45 PM to 5:45 PM). Then, go to Chinatown (7 mins), arrive at 5:52 PM. Then, meet William until 7:00 PM: 68 mins. Not enough.\n\nSo, the user can't meet William for the required time.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal is to meet Emily and Barbara, but not William.\n\nLet me see:\n\nMeet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM.\n\nThen, go to Union Square (14 mins), arrive at 1:44 PM.\n\nWait until 4:45 PM, meet Barbara until 5:45 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown (7 mins), arrive at 5:52 PM.\n\nBut William is available until 7:00 PM. So, the user can meet him from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM, which is 68 mins. Not enough.\n\nSo, that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, but what if the user doesn't go to William? Then, the user meets Emily and Barbara, which is two friends.\n\nAlternatively, if the user meets Emily and William, that's also two friends.\n\nSo, which option is better? The problem says to meet as many as possible, so both options meet two friends. But perhaps the user can meet all three if they adjust the schedule.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Emily for a shorter time, but the problem requires at least 105 mins.\n\nNo, that's not possible.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the user can meet Emily, then go to William, meet him for 105 mins, but end earlier, then go to Barbara.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nMeet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown (16 mins), arrive at 1:46 PM.\n\nWait until 5:15 PM to meet William.\n\nBut instead of meeting him until 7:00 PM, perhaps meet him until 6:15 PM, which is 60 mins. Then, go to Union Square (7 mins), arrive at 6:22 PM. Barbara's availability ends at 6:15 PM, so too late.\n\nAlternatively, meet William until 6:00 PM (45 mins), then go to Barbara, arriving at 6:07 PM. Barbara is available until 6:15 PM, so the user can meet her from 6:07 PM to 6:15 PM, which is 8 mins. Not enough.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the user can't meet all three friends and has to choose between two.\n\nIn that case, the optimal is to meet Emily and William, as that allows meeting two friends, each for their required durations.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM.\n\n2. Then, go to Chinatown, arriving at 1:46 PM. Wait until 5:15 PM.\n\n3. Meet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nBut then, Barbara is missed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can adjust the meeting with Emily to end earlier to fit Barbara.\n\nWait, Emily needs at least 105 mins. So, the earliest the user can leave is 1:30 PM.\n\nIf the user leaves at 1:30 PM, goes to Union Square (14 mins), arrives at 1:44 PM. Then, wait until 4:45 PM to meet Barbara for 60 mins, ending at 5:45 PM. Then, go to Chinatown (7 mins), arrive at 5:52 PM. Meet William until 7:00 PM (68 mins). Not enough.\n\nSo, that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Barbara for 60 mins, but start earlier. For example, from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM, then go to William.\n\nBut that still leaves 68 mins, which is insufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Barbara from 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM, then go to William, but that leaves only 45 mins.\n\nNo, that's not enough.\n\nSo, perhaps the conclusion is that the user can meet Emily and William, but not Barbara.\n\nAlternatively, the user can meet Emily and Barbara, but not William.\n\nWhich option is better? The problem says to meet as many as possible, so both options meet two friends. But perhaps the user can choose the option that allows more total meeting time.\n\nEmily requires 105 mins, Barbara 60, William 105.\n\nIf the user meets Emily and William: 105 + 105 = 210 mins.\n\nIf the user meets Emily and Barbara: 105 + 60 = 165 mins.\n\nSo, meeting Emily and William gives more total meeting time.\n\nTherefore, the optimal is to meet Emily and William.\n\nSo, the itinerary is:\n\n- Meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM.\n\n- Then, go to William, arriving at 1:46 PM. Wait until 5:15 PM.\n\n- Meet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nBut then, Barbara is missed.\n\nSo, the JSON output would include two meetings.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"as many as possible\", so perhaps the user can meet all three if they adjust the schedule differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Emily, then go to Barbara, meet her for 60 mins, then go to William for 105 mins.\n\nBut let's calculate the times:\n\nAfter Emily ends at 1:30 PM, go to Union Square (14 mins), arrive at 1:44 PM.\n\nWait until 4:45 PM to meet Barbara (4:45 PM to 5:45 PM).\n\nThen, go to Chinatown (7 mins), arrive at 5:52 PM.\n\nMeet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM: 68 mins. Not enough.\n\nSo, that's not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, meet Barbara from 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM, then go to William.\n\nArrive at 6:22 PM, meet him until 7:00 PM: 38 mins. Not enough.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the user can meet Barbara for 60 mins, but end earlier to reach William on time.\n\nWait, if the user meets Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM, then goes to William, arriving at 5:52 PM.\n\nThen, William's meeting would be from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM: 68 mins. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Barbara for 60 mins, but start earlier.\n\nWait, Barbara is available from 4:45 PM, so the user can meet her any time after that.\n\nSo, if the user arrives at Union Square at 1:44 PM, they can wait until 4:45 PM, meet Barbara until 5:45 PM, then go to William.\n\nBut that leaves 68 mins for William.\n\nSo, that's not acceptable.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Barbara for exactly 60 mins, but start at 5:00 PM, ending at 6:00 PM. Then, go to William.\n\nArrive at 6:07 PM, meet him until 7:00 PM: 53 mins. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, meet Barbara from 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM, then go to William.\n\nArrive at 6:22 PM, meet until 7:00 PM: 38 mins. Not enough.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nI think the conclusion is that the user can't meet all three friends, and the optimal is to meet Emily and William.\n\nSo, the itinerary is:\n\n1. Meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM.\n\n2. Then, go to William, arriving at 1:46 PM, wait until 5:15 PM.\n\n3. Meet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nBut then, Barbara is missed.\n\nSo, the JSON would have two meetings.\n\nWait, but the problem says to output the optimal schedule, which may include all possible meetings. But in this case, it's not possible to meet all three.\n\nSo, the code should generate the best possible itinerary, which in this case is meeting Emily and William.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Emily, Barbara, and William by adjusting the meeting times.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM.\n\nThen, go to Union Square (14 mins), arrive at 1:44 PM.\n\nThen, meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown (7 mins), arrive at 5:52 PM.\n\nThen, meet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM (68 mins). Not enough.\n\nSo, that's not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet William for 105 mins starting at 5:52 PM, but that would end at 7:37 PM, which is beyond William's availability (7:00 PM). So, that's not possible.\n\nSo, the user can't meet William for the required time in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the optimal is to meet Emily and William, totaling two meetings.\n\nSo, the code needs to compute this.\n\nNow, to model this in code.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Define the travel times between locations.\n\n2. Define the friends' availability.\n\n3. Generate possible itineraries.\n\n4. Check each possible order to see if it's feasible.\n\nBut considering the time constraints, perhaps the code can evaluate all possible permutations of the friends and check if a valid schedule exists.\n\nBut since the user starts at Castro, the code can try each permutation of the friends and see if the meetings can be scheduled without violating their time constraints.\n\nEach permutation would have the user visit the friends in a certain order, and for each, calculate the arrival times and meeting times.\n\nIf a permutation allows all meetings to be scheduled within their availability and required durations, then it's a valid itinerary.\n\nIf no permutation allows all three, then the code should try permutations of two friends.\n\nIn this case, as we saw, the permutation Emily \u2192 William allows two meetings.\n\nSo, the code should generate this itinerary.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the code.\n\nFirst, represent the travel times as a dictionary, with keys as tuples of (from, to) and values as minutes.\n\nThen, represent each friend as a dictionary with their name, location, start time, end time, and required duration.\n\nThe code will:\n\n1. Generate all possible permutations of the friends.\n\n2. For each permutation, calculate the schedule:\n\n   a. Start at Castro at 9:00 AM.\n\n   b. For each friend in the permutation order:\n\n      i. Calculate the travel time from the current location to the friend's location.\n\n      ii. Update the current time and location.\n\n      iii. Check if the friend's available time slot allows the meeting.\n\n         - The meeting must start no earlier than the friend's start time.\n\n         - The meeting must end no later than the friend's end time.\n\n         - The duration must be at least the required time.\n\n      iv. If all conditions are met, add the meeting to the itinerary.\n\n      v. If any condition is not met, break and try the next permutation.\n\n3. Keep track of the best itinerary (the one with the most meetings).\n\n4. After evaluating all permutations, output the best itinerary.\n\nBut in our case, the best itinerary is Emily \u2192 William, with two meetings.\n\nSo, the code should generate this.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, define the travel times.\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Castro', 'Alamo Square'): 8,\n    ('Castro', 'Union Square'): 19,\n    ('Castro', 'Chinatown'): 20,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Castro'): 8,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Union Square'): 14,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Chinatown'): 16,\n    ('Union Square', 'Castro'): 19,\n    ('Union Square', 'Alamo Square'): 15,\n    ('Union Square', 'Chinatown'): 7,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Castro'): 22,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Alamo Square'): 17,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Union Square'): 7,\n}\n\nThen, define the friends.\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Emily',\n        'location': 'Alamo Square',\n        'start': '11:45',\n        'end': '15:15',\n        'duration': 105\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Barbara',\n        'location': 'Union Square',\n        'start': '16:45',\n        'end': '18:15',\n        'duration': 60\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'William',\n        'location': 'Chinatown',\n        'start': '17:15',\n        'end': '19:00',\n        'duration': 105\n    }\n]\n\nNote: The times are in 24-hour format, so '11:45' is 11:45 AM, '15:15' is 3:15 PM, etc.\n\nThe code will need to convert these time strings to minutes since midnight for easier calculations.\n\nFor example, '9:00' is 9*60=540 mins.\n\n'11:45' is 11*60+45=705 mins.\n\nSimilarly, '17:15' is 17*60+15=1035 mins.\n\nSo, the code will have a function to convert time strings to minutes and vice versa.\n\nNext, the code will generate all permutations of the friends.\n\nFor each permutation, it will simulate the schedule:\n\n- Start at 'Castro' at 540 mins (9:00 AM).\n\n- For each friend in the permutation:\n\n   - Calculate travel time from current location to friend's location.\n\n   - Update current time: current_time += travel_time.\n\n   - Convert friend's start and end times to minutes.\n\n   - Check if current_time is before friend's start time. If so, wait until start time.\n\n   - The meeting must start at or after friend's start time.\n\n   - The meeting must end at or before friend's end time.\n\n   - The duration must be at least the required duration.\n\n   - So, the earliest start time is max(current_time, friend_start).\n\n   - The latest possible start time is friend_end - required_duration.\n\n   - If earliest_start > latest_start, then meeting is not possible. Break permutation.\n\n   - Else, schedule the meeting from earliest_start to earliest_start + required_duration.\n\n   - Update current_time to end of meeting.\n\n   - Update current_location to friend's location.\n\n- If all friends in permutation are met, record the itinerary.\n\nAfter evaluating all permutations, select the itinerary with the most meetings.\n\nIf multiple itineraries have the same number of meetings, choose the one with the earliest end time or any other criteria, but in our case, we just need the maximum number.\n\nSo, the code will:\n\n- Iterate through all permutations.\n\n- For each, simulate the schedule.\n\n- Keep track of the best itinerary.\n\nOnce the best itinerary is found, format it as JSON.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, import necessary modules: itertools for permutations.\n\nThen, define the functions to convert time strings to minutes and back.\n\nThen, define the travel times and friends.\n\nThen, for each permutation of friends:\n\n   simulate the schedule.\n\n   if all can be met, record the itinerary.\n\nThen, among all possible itineraries, select the one with the most meetings.\n\nIf no permutation allows all three, check for permutations of two friends.\n\nWait, but in the code, it's better to consider all possible subsets, but that could be complex.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of friends is small (3), we can generate all possible permutations of 1, 2, or 3 friends and check.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to generate all possible permutations of all possible lengths, from 3 down to 1, and for each, check if the permutation can be scheduled. Once a permutation of length 3 is found that works, that's the best. If not, check permutations of length 2, etc.\n\nBut in our case, as we saw, no permutation of 3 friends works, so the code should find the best permutation of 2 friends.\n\nBut perhaps the code can handle it by trying all permutations of all possible lengths.\n\nSo, the code will loop over the number of friends to meet, starting from 3 down to 1.\n\nFor each possible number, generate all possible permutations of that length.\n\nFor each permutation, simulate the schedule.\n\nIf a valid schedule is found, record it and break, as we're looking for the maximum number of meetings.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    h, m = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return h * 60 + m\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    h = minutes // 60\n    m = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{h}:{m:02d}\"\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Castro', 'Alamo Square'): 8,\n    ('Castro', 'Union Square'): 19,\n    ('Castro', 'Chinatown'): 20,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Castro'): 8,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Union Square'): 14,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Chinatown'): 16,\n    ('Union Square', 'Castro'): 19,\n    ('Union Square', 'Alamo Square'): 15,\n    ('Union Square', 'Chinatown'): 7,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Castro'): 22,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Alamo Square'): 17,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Union Square'): 7,\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Emily',\n        'location': 'Alamo Square',\n        'start': '11:45',\n        'end': '15:15',\n        'duration': 105\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Barbara',\n        'location': 'Union Square',\n        'start': '16:45',\n        'end': '18:15',\n        'duration': 60\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'William',\n        'location': 'Chinatown',\n        'start': '17:15',\n        'end': '19:00',\n        'duration': 105\n    }\n]\n\nbest_itinerary = []\n\nfor num_friends in range(3, 0, -1):\n    for perm in permutations(friends, num_friends):\n        current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n        current_location = 'Castro'\n        itinerary = []\n        valid = True\n        for friend in perm:\n            # Calculate travel time\n            travel = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n            if travel is None:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            current_time += travel\n            # Convert friend's times to minutes\n            friend_start = time_to_minutes(friend['start'])\n            friend_end = time_to_minutes(friend['end'])\n            # Calculate earliest possible start time\n            earliest_start = max(current_time, friend_start)\n            # Calculate latest possible start time\n            latest_start = friend_end - friend['duration']\n            if earliest_start > latest_start:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            # Schedule the meeting\n            meeting_start = earliest_start\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n            itinerary.append({\n                'action': 'meet',\n                'location': friend['location'],\n                'person': friend['name'],\n                'start_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_start),\n                'end_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n            })\n            # Update current time and location\n            current_time = meeting_end\n            current_location = friend['location']\n        if valid:\n            if len(itinerary) > len(best_itinerary):\n                best_itinerary = itinerary\n            elif len(itinerary) == len(best_itinerary):\n                # If same number, choose the one with earlier end time\n                # Calculate total time\n                total = sum(f['duration'] for f in perm)\n                # Compare with best_itinerary's total\n                best_total = sum(f['duration'] for f in best_itinerary)\n                if total > best_total:\n                    best_itinerary = itinerary\n            break  # Since we're checking from higher to lower, first valid is best\n\n# Output the best itinerary\nimport json\nprint('SOLUTION:')\nprint(json.dumps({'itinerary': best_itinerary}))\n</response>\n\nNow, I need to test this code.\n\nBut considering the earlier analysis, the code should find that the permutation Emily \u2192 William is valid, meeting two friends.\n\nWait, but in the code, the friends are in a list, and permutations are generated. So, in the code, the friends are represented as dictionaries, and the permutations are of the friends' dictionaries.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the friends are in a list, and the permutations are generated correctly.\n\nWait, but in the code, the friends are in the order Emily, Barbara, William. So, the permutations would include all possible orders.\n\nBut when the code tries the permutation of Emily and William, it would check if the schedule is possible.\n\nSo, let's simulate:\n\nPermutation: Emily, William.\n\ncurrent_time starts at 540 (9:00 AM).\n\nFirst, Emily:\n\nTravel from Castro to Alamo Square: 8 mins. current_time becomes 548.\n\nFriend Emily's start is 705 mins (11:45 AM), end is 915 mins (3:15 PM).\n\nearliest_start is max(548, 705) = 705.\n\nlatest_start is 915 - 105 = 810.\n\nSo, 705 <= 810: valid.\n\nMeeting scheduled from 705 to 705+105=810 (1:30 PM).\n\nItinerary: Emily from 11:45 to 13:30.\n\ncurrent_time becomes 810, location Alamo Square.\n\nNext, William:\n\nTravel from Alamo Square to Chinatown: 16 mins. current_time becomes 810 +16=826 mins (13:46).\n\nWilliam's start is 1035 (17:15), end is 1140 (19:00).\n\nearliest_start is max(826, 1035) = 1035.\n\nlatest_start is 1140 -105=1035.\n\nSo, meeting starts at 1035, ends at 1140.\n\nItinerary: William from 17:15 to 19:00.\n\ncurrent_time becomes 1140.\n\nSo, this permutation is valid, meeting two friends.\n\nThus, the code would record this itinerary.\n\nSince it's the first valid permutation with two friends, it would be the best.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Emily\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"13:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"person\": \"William\", \"start_time\": \"17:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:00\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nBut wait, in the code, the permutation is Emily and William, but in the code, the friends are in the order [Emily, Barbara, William], so the permutation for two friends could be any two.\n\nBut the code would find that the permutation Emily \u2192 William is valid, and thus include it.\n\nThus, the code should output this JSON.\n\nNow, the code as written should handle this correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule for a user visiting San Francisco, considering the travel times between locations and the availability of their friends. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible within their specified time windows.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Travel Times**: Represent the travel times between each pair of locations using a dictionary where keys are tuples of locations and values are travel times in minutes.\n2. **Define Friends' Availability**: Represent each friend with their name, location, available start and end times, and the minimum meeting duration required.\n3. **Generate Permutations**: Use permutations to consider all possible orders of meeting friends. This helps in evaluating different schedules to find the optimal one.\n4. **Simulate Schedules**: For each permutation, simulate the schedule starting from The Castro at 9:00 AM. Calculate the travel times and check if each meeting can be scheduled within the friend's availability window.\n5. **Check Validity**: For each permutation, ensure that the meeting can start no earlier than the friend's available start time and end no later than their available end time. If a permutation is valid and meets the maximum number of friends, record it as the best itinerary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    h, m = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return h * 60 + m\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    h = minutes // 60\n    m = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{h}:{m:02d}\"\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Castro', 'Alamo Square'): 8,\n    ('Castro', 'Union Square'): 19,\n    ('Castro', 'Chinatown'): 20,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Castro'): 8,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Union Square'): 14,\n    ('Alamo Square', 'Chinatown'): 16,\n    ('Union Square', 'Castro'): 19,\n    ('Union Square', 'Alamo Square'): 15,\n    ('Union Square', 'Chinatown'): 7,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Castro'): 22,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Alamo Square'): 17,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Union Square'): 7,\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Emily',\n        'location': 'Alamo Square',\n        'start': '11:45',\n        'end': '15:15',\n        'duration': 105\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Barbara',\n        'location': 'Union Square',\n        'start': '16:45',\n        'end': '18:15',\n        'duration': 60\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'William',\n        'location': 'Chinatown',\n        'start': '17:15',\n        'end': '19:00',\n        'duration': 105\n    }\n]\n\nbest_itinerary = []\n\nfor num_friends in range(3, 0, -1):\n    for perm in permutations(friends, num_friends):\n        current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n        current_location = 'Castro'\n        itinerary = []\n        valid = True\n        for friend in perm:\n            # Calculate travel time\n            travel = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n            if travel is None:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            current_time += travel\n            # Convert friend's times to minutes\n            friend_start = time_to_minutes(friend['start'])\n            friend_end = time_to_minutes(friend['end'])\n            # Calculate earliest possible start time\n            earliest_start = max(current_time, friend_start)\n            # Calculate latest possible start time\n            latest_start = friend_end - friend['duration']\n            if earliest_start > latest_start:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            # Schedule the meeting\n            meeting_start = earliest_start\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n            itinerary.append({\n                'action': 'meet',\n                'location': friend['location'],\n                'person': friend['name'],\n                'start_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_start),\n                'end_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n            })\n            # Update current time and location\n            current_time = meeting_end\n            current_location = friend['location']\n        if valid:\n            if len(itinerary) > len(best_itinerary):\n                best_itinerary = itinerary\n            elif len(itinerary) == len(best_itinerary):\n                # If same number, choose the one with earlier end time\n                # Compare the end time of the last meeting\n                if current_time < time_to_minutes(best_itinerary[-1]['end_time']):\n                    best_itinerary = itinerary\n            break  # Found a valid schedule with max possible friends\n\nprint('SOLUTION:')\nprint(json.dumps({'itinerary': best_itinerary}))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code starts by defining the travel times between locations and the availability of each friend.
