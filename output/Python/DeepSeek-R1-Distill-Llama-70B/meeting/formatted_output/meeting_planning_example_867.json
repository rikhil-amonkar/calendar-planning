            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to write a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the given constraints. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem. The user is in San Francisco and wants to meet as many friends as possible, starting from Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. Each friend has a specific location and time window they're available, and each meeting has a minimum duration. The goal is to find a schedule that allows meeting as many friends as possible without overlapping and considering travel times between locations.\n\nI'll start by listing all the friends and their details. Each friend has a name, location, available start and end times, and a minimum meeting duration. I'll create a list of dictionaries to represent each friend's constraints.\n\nNext, I need to handle the travel times between locations. The user provided a matrix of travel times in minutes between each pair of districts. I'll represent this as a dictionary where each key is a tuple of (from_location, to_location) and the value is the time in minutes.\n\nNow, the main challenge is to compute the optimal schedule. This sounds like a scheduling problem where I need to select a sequence of meetings that fits within the time constraints, including travel times, and maximizes the number of friends met.\n\nI think a backtracking approach might be suitable here. Backtracking can explore all possible sequences of meetings, checking each for feasibility. However, given the number of friends (there are 9), this could be computationally intensive, but for a small number like 9, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a greedy approach, but that might not always find the optimal solution. Since the problem requires the optimal schedule, backtracking is more appropriate.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible permutations of the friends.\n2. For each permutation, check if it's possible to schedule the meetings in that order without overlapping and within their available time windows, including travel times.\n3. Keep track of the permutation that allows the maximum number of meetings.\n\nBut wait, the number of permutations for 9 friends is 9! which is 362880. That's a lot, but maybe manageable with some optimizations. Alternatively, I could use a branch and bound approach, but for simplicity, perhaps a backtracking approach that tries to add each friend in all possible orders and keeps track of the best solution so far.\n\nWait, but the order in which we meet friends matters because of travel times. So, the sequence affects the total time. Therefore, the order must be considered carefully.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a graph problem where each node represents a friend and edges represent the possibility of moving from one friend's location to another, considering the time it takes. Then, finding the longest possible path that fits within the time constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to represent each possible state as the current location and the current time, and for each friend not yet met, check if it's possible to meet them next.\n\nSo, perhaps a recursive approach where each step selects a friend to meet next, updates the current location and time, and proceeds until all friends are considered.\n\nTo implement this, I can use a recursive function that tries all possible next friends and keeps track of the best schedule found so far.\n\nBut with 9 friends, the recursion depth could be up to 9, which is manageable. However, the number of states could be large because each state depends on the current location and time, and which friends have been met.\n\nWait, but the state can be represented as a tuple of (current_location, current_time, met_friends). For each state, we can try all possible next friends that haven't been met yet, compute the earliest possible start time considering travel and their availability, and see if their meeting can fit.\n\nTo optimize, I can memoize states to avoid redundant calculations, but given the time constraints, it's possible that the number of states is manageable without memoization.\n\nSo, the steps for the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Initialize the starting point: location is Haight-Ashbury, time is 9:00 AM, and no friends met yet.\n\n2. For each possible next friend, check if it's possible to meet them. This involves:\n   a. Calculating the travel time from the current location to the friend's location.\n   b. Determining the earliest arrival time at the friend's location.\n   c. Checking if the friend is available during a window that allows the meeting duration.\n   d. If possible, add this friend to the schedule and recursively proceed to meet the next friend.\n\n3. Keep track of the schedule that meets the maximum number of friends.\n\nBut wait, each friend's availability is a fixed window. So, for each friend, the meeting must start no earlier than their start time and end no later than their end time, and the duration must be at least the minimum required.\n\nSo, for a given friend, the possible start time is between their available start and (their end time minus the required duration). The earliest we can start is the maximum of (current_time + travel_time) and their available start time.\n\nIf the latest possible start time is earlier than the earliest possible start time, then it's not possible to meet this friend next.\n\nSo, for each friend, I need to compute the earliest possible start time and see if there's a window where the meeting can fit.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent time. It's easier to work in minutes since midnight. So, 9:00 AM is 9*60=540 minutes. Each time can be represented as an integer.\n\nSo, I'll convert all times to minutes since midnight.\n\nFor example, 10:30 AM is 10*60 +30=630 minutes.\n\nEach friend's available time window is from start_time to end_time, and the meeting must be at least min_duration minutes.\n\nSo, for each friend, the latest possible start time is end_time - min_duration.\n\nNow, when considering a friend as the next meeting, I need to:\n\n- Compute the travel time from the current location to their location.\n- The arrival_time is current_time + travel_time.\n- The earliest possible start is max(arrival_time, friend's start_time).\n- The latest possible start is friend's end_time - min_duration.\n- If earliest_start > latest_start, can't meet this friend next.\n- Otherwise, the meeting starts at earliest_start and ends at earliest_start + min_duration.\n- Then, the new current_time is the end of this meeting, and the new location is the friend's location.\n- Proceed to the next friend.\n\nBut wait, maybe starting earlier allows for more meetings later. However, in the interest of maximizing the number of friends, perhaps it's better to take the earliest possible slot to leave more time for others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order in which friends are met can affect the total number. For example, meeting a friend with a tight time window early might be better.\n\nSo, the algorithm needs to explore all possible orders, but with 9 friends, that's a lot. Maybe a heuristic can be applied, like prioritizing friends with earlier availability or shorter time windows.\n\nBut for the sake of finding the optimal solution, perhaps the backtracking approach is necessary, even if it's computationally intensive.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, I'll create a list of friends, each with their details.\n\nfriends = [\n    {'name': 'Elizabeth', 'location': 'Mission District', 'start': 630, 'end': 1200, 'duration': 90},\n    {'name': 'David', 'location': 'Union Square', 'start': 915, 'end': 1050, 'duration': 45},\n    {'name': 'Sandra', 'location': 'Pacific Heights', 'start': 420, 'end': 1200, 'duration': 120},\n    {'name': 'Thomas', 'location': 'Bayview', 'start': 1170, 'end': 1260, 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Robert', 'location': 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'start': 600, 'end': 900, 'duration': 15},\n    {'name': 'Kenneth', 'location': 'Marina District', 'start': 645, 'end': 780, 'duration': 45},\n    {'name': 'Melissa', 'location': 'Richmond District', 'start': 1035, 'end': 1200, 'duration': 15},\n    {'name': 'Kimberly', 'location': 'Sunset District', 'start': 615, 'end': 1085, 'duration': 105},\n    {'name': 'Amanda', 'location': 'Golden Gate Park', 'start': 465, 'end': 1170, 'duration': 15},\n]\n\nWait, let me check the constraints again to make sure I have the correct times.\n\nElizabeth: Mission District, 10:30 AM to 8:00 PM. So 10:30 is 630, 8 PM is 1200.\n\nDavid: Union Square, 3:15 PM to 7:00 PM. 3:15 is 915, 7:00 is 1050.\n\nSandra: Pacific Heights, 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM. 7:00 is 420, 8:00 PM is 1200.\n\nThomas: Bayview, 7:30 PM to 8:30 PM. 7:30 is 1170, 8:30 is 1260.\n\nRobert: Fisherman's Wharf, 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. 10:00 is 600, 3:00 is 900.\n\nKenneth: Marina District, 10:45 AM to 1:00 PM. 10:45 is 645, 1:00 PM is 780.\n\nMelissa: Richmond District, 6:15 PM to 8:00 PM. 6:15 is 1035, 8:00 is 1200.\n\nKimberly: Sunset District, 10:15 AM to 6:15 PM. 10:15 is 615, 6:15 is 1085.\n\nAmanda: Golden Gate Park, 7:45 AM to 6:45 PM. 7:45 is 465, 6:45 is 1170.\n\nWait, 7:45 AM is 7*60 +45= 465 minutes, correct.\n\nNow, the travel times. I'll create a dictionary where the key is a tuple (from_loc, to_loc), and the value is the time in minutes.\n\nI'll have to parse all the given travel times. Let's list them:\n\nHaight-Ashbury to others:\nMission District:11\nUnion Square:19\nPacific Heights:12\nBayview:18\nFisherman's Wharf:23\nMarina District:17\nRichmond District:10\nSunset District:15\nGolden Gate Park:7\n\nThen, Mission District to others:\nHaight-Ashbury:12\nUnion Square:15\nPacific Heights:16\nBayview:14\nFisherman's Wharf:22\nMarina District:19\nRichmond District:20\nSunset District:24\nGolden Gate Park:17\n\nUnion Square to others:\nHaight-Ashbury:18\nMission District:14\nPacific Heights:15\nBayview:15\nFisherman's Wharf:15\nMarina District:18\nRichmond District:20\nSunset District:27\nGolden Gate Park:22\n\nPacific Heights to others:\nHaight-Ashbury:11\nMission District:15\nUnion Square:12\nBayview:22\nFisherman's Wharf:13\nMarina District:6\nRichmond District:12\nSunset District:21\nGolden Gate Park:15\n\nBayview to others:\nHaight-Ashbury:19\nMission District:13\nUnion Square:18\nPacific Heights:23\nFisherman's Wharf:25\nMarina District:27\nRichmond District:25\nSunset District:23\nGolden Gate Park:22\n\nFisherman's Wharf to others:\nHaight-Ashbury:22\nMission District:22\nUnion Square:13\nPacific Heights:12\nBayview:26\nMarina District:9\nRichmond District:18\nSunset District:27\nGolden Gate Park:25\n\nMarina District to others:\nHaight-Ashbury:16\nMission District:20\nUnion Square:16\nPacific Heights:7\nBayview:27\nFisherman's Wharf:10\nRichmond District:11\nSunset District:19\nGolden Gate Park:18\n\nRichmond District to others:\nHaight-Ashbury:10\nMission District:20\nUnion Square:21\nPacific Heights:10\nBayview:27\nFisherman's Wharf:18\nMarina District:9\nSunset District:11\nGolden Gate Park:9\n\nSunset District to others:\nHaight-Ashbury:15\nMission District:25\nUnion Square:30\nPacific Heights:21\nBayview:22\nFisherman's Wharf:29\nMarina District:21\nRichmond District:12\nGolden Gate Park:11\n\nGolden Gate Park to others:\nHaight-Ashbury:7\nMission District:17\nUnion Square:22\nPacific Heights:16\nBayview:23\nFisherman's Wharf:24\nMarina District:16\nRichmond District:7\nSunset District:10\n\nThat's a lot. I'll have to create a dictionary for each possible pair.\n\nBut in code, I can represent it as a dictionary with keys as tuples.\n\nNow, in the code, I'll create this travel_times dictionary.\n\nNext, the algorithm.\n\nI'll start at Haight-Ashbury at 540 minutes (9:00 AM), with no friends met.\n\nI need to explore all possible orders of meeting friends, keeping track of the current location and time, and the list of met friends.\n\nEach step, for the current state, try all possible next friends that haven't been met yet.\n\nFor each next friend, calculate the earliest possible start time and see if it's possible to meet them.\n\nIf possible, proceed recursively, adding this meeting to the itinerary.\n\nThe goal is to find the itinerary with the maximum number of friends met.\n\nSo, the code can be structured with a recursive function that tries each possible next friend and updates the state accordingly.\n\nTo implement this, I'll use a helper function that takes the current location, current time, a list of met friends, and the itinerary so far. It will try each possible next friend and see if adding them is feasible.\n\nBut since Python has a recursion limit, and with 9 levels, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can implement this with a loop-based approach, but recursion is easier for this problem.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Read all friends and their constraints, convert time to minutes.\n\n2. Create the travel_times dictionary.\n\n3. Initialize the best_itinerary as empty.\n\n4. Define a recursive function that tries each possible next friend and updates the itinerary.\n\n5. For each friend not yet met, calculate the earliest possible start time.\n\n6. If feasible, add to the itinerary and proceed.\n\n7. Keep track of the best itinerary (the one with the most friends met).\n\nNow, let's think about the base case. When all friends are met, compare the length to the best and update if necessary.\n\nBut since we're trying to maximize, we can stop exploring a path if it's impossible to meet more friends than the current best.\n\nWait, but the order matters. So, perhaps a depth-first search approach, trying all possibilities.\n\nNow, to represent the state, the function needs to know:\n\n- current_location: where you are now.\n\n- current_time: the current time in minutes.\n\n- met: a set of friends already met.\n\n- itinerary: the list of meetings so far.\n\nBut passing all this in each recursive call could be memory intensive, but for 9 friends, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since the order in which friends are met matters, perhaps using memoization isn't straightforward.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is to use a class-based approach with variables to track the state, but for simplicity, I'll proceed with a recursive function.\n\nWait, but in Python, using a function with parameters is easier.\n\nSo, the function signature could be:\n\ndef backtrack(current_location, current_time, met, itinerary):\n\n    if len(met) > len(best_met):\n        update best_itinerary and best_met.\n\n    for each friend not in met:\n        check if it's possible to meet them next.\n        if yes:\n            add to met, add to itinerary, proceed.\n\nBut in Python, variables in the outer scope can be accessed, but to modify them, they need to be nonlocal. Alternatively, I can pass the best variables as parameters, but that's less efficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can encapsulate the state in a class, but perhaps it's overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach is to use a list to keep track of the best itinerary, initializing it as empty, and updating it as better solutions are found.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nbest_itinerary = []\nbest_count = 0\n\ndef backtrack(current_location, current_time, met, itinerary):\n    global best_itinerary, best_count\n\n    if len(met) > best_count:\n        best_count = len(met)\n        best_itinerary = itinerary.copy()\n\n    for friend in friends:\n        if friend not in met:\n            # Calculate travel time\n            travel = travel_times[(current_location, friend['location'])]\n            arrival = current_time + travel\n\n            # Friend's available window\n            start = friend['start']\n            end = friend['end']\n            duration = friend['duration']\n\n            # Earliest possible start is max(arrival, start)\n            earliest_start = max(arrival, start)\n\n            # Latest possible start is end - duration\n            latest_start = end - duration\n\n            if earliest_start > latest_start:\n                continue  # Can't meet this friend now\n\n            # The meeting starts at earliest_start and ends at earliest_start + duration\n            meeting = {\n                'action': 'meet',\n                'location': friend['location'],\n                'person': friend['name'],\n                'start_time': convert_minutes(earliest_start),\n                'end_time': convert_minutes(earliest_start + duration)\n            }\n\n            # Proceed to next\n            new_met = met.copy()\n            new_met.add(friend['name'])\n            new_itinerary = itinerary.copy()\n            new_itinerary.append(meeting)\n\n            # Update current location and time\n            new_location = friend['location']\n            new_time = earliest_start + duration\n\n            backtrack(new_location, new_time, new_met, new_itinerary)\n\nBut wait, the friends are represented as dictionaries, so checking if a friend is in 'met' (which is a set of names) is possible.\n\nWait, no. In the code above, 'met' is a set of friend names. So, for each friend in the friends list, if their name is not in 'met', proceed.\n\nBut in the code above, the 'for friend in friends' loop will iterate through all friends, and for each, check if their name is in 'met'.\n\nWait, but in the initial call, 'met' is an empty set, so all friends are considered.\n\nWait, but the 'friends' list is a list of dictionaries, each with 'name' key. So, in the loop, for each friend in friends, if friend['name'] not in met, proceed.\n\nSo, the code inside the loop should be:\n\nif friend['name'] not in met:\n\nBut in the code above, I wrote 'if friend not in met:', which is incorrect because 'met' is a set of names, not friend objects.\n\nSo, that's a bug. I need to correct that.\n\nSo, inside the loop:\n\nif friend['name'] not in met:\n\nThen proceed.\n\nAnother thing: when calculating the travel time, I need to get it from the travel_times dictionary. So, the key is (current_location, friend['location']).\n\nBut what if the key is not present? That's unlikely because the problem provides all travel times.\n\nSo, assuming that the dictionary is correctly built.\n\nNow, the function needs to be called initially with current_location as 'Haight-Ashbury', current_time as 540, met as an empty set, and itinerary as an empty list.\n\nSo, the initial call is:\n\nbacktrack('Haight-Ashbury', 540, set(), [])\n\nBut wait, in the code, 'met' is a set of names, and 'itinerary' is a list of meeting dictionaries.\n\nNow, the function will explore all possible orders, trying to meet as many friends as possible.\n\nBut with 9 friends, the number of possible paths is 9! = 362880, which is manageable, but each path requires several calculations.\n\nWait, but each level of recursion reduces the number of friends, so it's 9 + 8 + 7 + ... +1 = 45 steps in the worst case, but multiplied by the number of possibilities at each step.\n\nWait, no. At each step, for each possible next friend, a new branch is created. So, the number of nodes is the sum from k=0 to 9 of (9 choose k) * k! ), which is the sum of permutations.\n\nWhich is 9! + 9! + ... but I'm not sure. Anyway, for 9 friends, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize by pruning paths that can't possibly beat the current best.\n\nFor example, if the current path has met 5 friends, and the best is 6, and there are only 4 friends left, then it's impossible to get a better solution, so we can stop exploring that path.\n\nSo, in the function, before proceeding, check if the remaining possible friends plus the current count can exceed the best_count. If not, prune the branch.\n\nThis can save a lot of computation time.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nremaining = len(friends) - len(met)\nif len(met) + remaining <= best_count:\n    return\n\nBut wait, 'remaining' is the number of friends not yet met. So, the maximum possible is len(met) + remaining.\n\nIf that's less than or equal to best_count, no need to proceed.\n\nSo, adding this as the first line in the function.\n\nNow, the code becomes more efficient.\n\nAnother optimization: order the friends in the loop such that friends with earlier availability are tried first. This can lead to finding a good solution early and pruning other branches.\n\nBut for simplicity, perhaps it's better to proceed without this optimization for now.\n\nNow, let's think about the convert_minutes function. It needs to take an integer representing minutes since midnight and convert it to a string in 'H:MM' format, without leading zeros.\n\nFor example, 540 minutes is 9:00.\n\nSo, the function can be:\n\ndef convert_minutes(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nWait, but the problem says no leading zero, so for 9:00, it's '9:00', not '09:00'.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement:\n\n\"Times should be in 24-hour format like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero).\"\n\nSo, hours can be single or double digits, but no leading zero. So, 9:00 is correct, 13:30 is correct.\n\nSo, the function should format hours as integer without leading zero, and minutes as two digits.\n\nSo, the function can be:\n\ndef convert_minutes(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, the initial code may not be efficient enough. For example, if a friend's meeting time is earlier than the current time, but after adding travel time, it's possible to meet them.\n\nBut the code correctly calculates the earliest possible start as the maximum of arrival time and the friend's start time.\n\nSo, that's handled.\n\nAnother thing: the function should consider that the friend's end time must be after the meeting ends.\n\nSo, the meeting's end time is earliest_start + duration, which must be <= friend['end'].\n\nBut since earliest_start is <= (friend['end'] - duration), because latest_start is end - duration, and earliest_start <= latest_start, this is ensured.\n\nSo, the code is correct in that aspect.\n\nNow, let's think about possible bugs.\n\nOne possible issue is that the travel_times dictionary may not have the correct keys. For example, the key is (from_location, to_location), and all possible pairs are present.\n\nAnother possible issue is that the initial call is correct.\n\nTesting the code with a small example may help, but since I can't run it now, I have to make sure the logic is correct.\n\nNow, considering the code structure.\n\nI'll define the friends list, the travel_times dictionary, the convert_minutes function, and the backtracking function.\n\nBut in Python, the function can't modify the global variables unless declared as nonlocal or global.\n\nSo, I'll declare best_itinerary and best_count as global variables.\n\nBut to make the code more efficient, perhaps using a class to encapsulate the data would be better, but for simplicity, I'll proceed with global variables.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code would look like this:\n\nFirst, define the friends.\n\nThen, define the travel_times dictionary.\n\nThen, the convert_minutes function.\n\nThen, the backtracking function.\n\nFinally, call the backtracking function and print the result.\n\nWait, but the code needs to output the JSON when executed, so after computing the best_itinerary, it should print it as a JSON dictionary.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\n- Import necessary modules (none needed except perhaps json).\n\n- Define the friends list.\n\n- Define the travel_times dictionary.\n\n- Define convert_minutes function.\n\n- Initialize best_itinerary and best_count.\n\n- Define the backtrack function.\n\n- Call backtrack with initial parameters.\n\n- Print the best_itinerary as JSON.\n\nBut in the code, I need to make sure that the best_itinerary is built correctly.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the 'itinerary' is a list of meeting dictionaries, each with 'action', 'location', 'person', 'start_time', 'end_time'.\n\nSo, the final output is a dictionary with an 'itinerary' key pointing to this list.\n\nSo, after the backtracking is done, the code should create a dictionary like:\n\n{\n    \"itinerary\": best_itinerary\n}\n\nAnd then print it as JSON.\n\nNow, considering all of this, I'll write the code.\n\nBut I realize that in the code, the 'friends' list is a list of dictionaries, each with 'name', 'location', 'start', 'end', 'duration'.\n\nSo, I need to create that list correctly.\n\nAlso, the travel_times dictionary needs to be correctly populated with all the given travel times.\n\nThis is a bit tedious, but necessary.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Mission District'): 11,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Union Square'): 19,\n

However, the initial code may not capture all possibilities correctly because the function may not explore all paths.\n\nWait, no. The function is recursive and explores all possible paths, updating the best_itinerary whenever a longer one is found.\n\nBut in the code, the 'backtrack' function is called, and the initial state is set.\n\nBut I think there's a bug in the way the 'best_itinerary' is updated. Because inside the function, after adding the meeting, it calls 'backtrack' and then checks if the new_met is better. But the 'backtrack' function may have already updated the best variables, so the check after is redundant.\n\nWait, no. Because the 'backtrack' function is called, and during its execution, it may find a better solution and update the best variables. So, the check after is unnecessary and may not capture the best solution correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not have that check. The function should rely on the recursive calls to update the best variables.\n\nSo, perhaps the code inside the loop should be:\n\nnew_met = set(met)\nnew_met.add(friend['name'])\nnew_itinerary = itinerary.copy()\nnew_itinerary.append(meeting)\n\nbacktrack(new_location, new_time, new_met, new_itinerary)\n\nAnd the function's base case is when all friends are met.\n\nBut in the function, the first line is the pruning step.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\ndef backtrack(current_location, current_time, met, itinerary):\n    global best_itinerary, best_count\n\n    # Prune if no better solution possible\n    remaining = len(friends) - len(met)\n    if len(met) + remaining <= best_count:\n        return\n\n    # Update best if current is better\n    if len(met) > best_count:\n        best_count = len(met)\n        best_itinerary = itinerary.copy()\n\n    # Try each possible next friend\n    for friend in friends:\n        if friend['name'] in met:\n            continue\n\n        # Calculate travel time to friend's location\n        travel = travel_times[(current_location, friend['location'])]\n        arrival = current_time + travel\n\n        # Friend's availability\n        start = friend['start']\n        end = friend['end']\n        duration = friend['duration']\n\n        earliest_start = max(arrival, start)\n        latest_start = end - duration\n\n        if earliest_start > latest_start:\n            continue  # Cannot meet this friend\n\n        # Schedule the meeting\n        meeting_start = earliest_start\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + duration\n\n        # Create meeting entry\n        meeting = {\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': convert_minutes(meeting_start),\n            'end_time': convert_minutes(meeting_end)\n        }\n\n        # Update the state\n        new_met = set(met)\n        new_met.add(friend['name'])\n        new_itinerary = itinerary.copy()\n        new_itinerary.append(meeting)\n\n        # Update current location and time\n        new_location = friend['location']\n        new_time = meeting_end\n\n        # Recurse\n        backtrack(new_location, new_time, new_met, new_itinerary)\n\nWait, but in this version, the function first checks if the current itinerary is better, then tries all possible next steps.\n\nThis way, when the function reaches a state where no more friends can be added (i.e., all are met), it will update the best if applicable.\n\nBut I think this is correct.\n\nNow, testing this code.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the initial call is:\n\nbacktrack('Haight-Ashbury', 540, set(), [])\n\nSo, starting at 9:00 AM.\n\nNow, the code should compute the best possible itinerary.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps the code may not find the optimal solution quickly, but for the problem's sake, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the final code should include all the travel times correctly, which is a bit tedious but necessary.\n\nBut in the code above, the travel_times dictionary is not fully populated. So, I'll have to include all the key-value pairs as given in the problem statement.\n\nThis is a lot of data entry, but it's necessary for the code to work correctly.\n\nOnce the code is written, it should compute the optimal itinerary and print it as JSON.\n\nSo, the final code is as written above, with the travel_times and friends correctly populated.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal meeting schedule for visiting as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering their availability and travel times between locations. The solution involves using a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible meeting sequences and select the one that maximizes the number of friends met.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM and need to meet friends located in different districts, each with specific time windows and meeting durations. The goal is to find a schedule that allows meeting the maximum number of friends without overlapping meetings and considering travel times.\n\n2. **Travel Times**: A matrix of travel times between each pair of districts is provided. This data is stored in a dictionary for quick lookup.\n\n3. **Friend Constraints**: Each friend's availability, location, and required meeting duration are stored in a list of dictionaries.\n\n4. **Backtracking Algorithm**: This algorithm explores all possible sequences of meetings. For each friend, it calculates the earliest possible start time considering travel from the current location and the friend's availability. If feasible, the meeting is added to the itinerary, and the algorithm proceeds to the next friend.\n\n5. **Optimization**: The algorithm prunes paths where the remaining possible meetings cannot exceed the current best solution, improving efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Define travel times between locations in minutes\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Haight-Ashbury',
