            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to help someone plan their day in San Francisco by meeting as many friends as possible. The user starts at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM and has several friends located in different areas with specific time windows. My task is to write a Python program that calculates the optimal schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input parameters. There are travel times between various locations, and each friend has a specific location, available time window, and minimum meeting duration. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible without missing any of their availability windows and accounting for travel times.\n\nI'll start by defining the travel times between each pair of locations. This will be stored in a dictionary where the keys are tuples of locations, and the values are the travel times in minutes. Next, I'll represent each friend with their details: name, location, start and end times, and the required meeting duration.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to use permutations to consider all possible orders of meeting friends. Since the user wants to meet as many friends as possible, I'll start by trying to meet all friends and then reduce the number if it's not possible. For each permutation, I'll simulate the schedule starting from Nob Hill at 9:00 AM, calculate the travel times, and check if each meeting can fit within the friend's availability.\n\nI'll need helper functions to convert time strings to minutes and vice versa. This will make it easier to perform time calculations. For each permutation, I'll track the current time and location, and for each friend in the permutation, I'll calculate the earliest possible start time for the meeting, ensuring it's within their available window. If a meeting can't be scheduled, I'll mark that permutation as invalid and move on.\n\nOnce a valid schedule is found that meets the maximum number of friends, I'll record it as the best itinerary. If multiple schedules meet the same number of friends, I'll choose the one that ends earlier.\n\nFinally, I'll output the best itinerary in the required JSON format, listing each meeting with its location, person, start, and end times.\n\nI need to make sure the code is self-contained, runs independently, and doesn't have any additional text or explanations. It should compute the schedule dynamically based on the given parameters without relying on pre-determined answers.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nimport json\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    h, m = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return h * 60 + m\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    h = minutes // 60\n    m = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{h}:{m:02d}\"\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Richmond District'): 14,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Financial District'): 9,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'North Beach'): 8,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'The Castro'): 17,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Golden Gate Park'): 17,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Nob Hill'): 17,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Financial District'): 22,\n    ('Richmond District', 'North Beach'): 17,\n    ('Richmond District', 'The Castro'): 16,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Golden Gate Park'): 9,\n    ('Financial District', 'Nob Hill'): 8,\n    ('Financial District', 'Richmond District'): 21,\n    ('Financial District', 'North Beach'): 7,\n    ('Financial District', 'The Castro'): 23,\n    ('Financial District', 'Golden Gate Park'): 23,\n    ('North Beach', 'Nob Hill'): 7,\n    ('North Beach', 'Richmond District'): 18,\n    ('North Beach', 'Financial District'): 8,\n    ('North Beach', 'The Castro'): 22,\n    ('North Beach', 'Golden Gate Park'): 22,\n    ('The Castro', 'Nob Hill'): 16,\n    ('The Castro', 'Richmond District'): 16,\n    ('The Castro', 'Financial District'): 20,\n    ('The Castro', 'North Beach'): 20,\n    ('The Castro', 'Golden Gate Park'): 11,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Nob Hill'): 20,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Richmond District'): 7,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Financial District'): 26,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'North Beach'): 24,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'The Castro'): 13,\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Emily',\n        'location': 'Richmond District',\n        'start': '19:00',\n        'end': '21:00',\n        'duration': 15\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Margaret',\n        'location': 'Financial District',\n        'start': '16:30',\n        'end': '20:15',\n        'duration': 75\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Ronald',\n        'location': 'North Beach',\n        'start': '18:30',\n        'end': '19:30',\n        'duration': 45\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Deborah',\n        'location': 'The Castro',\n        'start': '13:45',\n        'end': '21:15',\n        'duration': 90\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Jeffrey',\n        'location': 'Golden Gate Park',\n        'start': '11:15',\n        'end': '14:30',\n        'duration': 120\n    }\n]\n\nbest_itinerary = []\n\nfor num_friends in range(5, 0, -1):\n    for perm in permutations(friends, num_friends):\n        current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n        current_location = 'Nob Hill'\n        itinerary = []\n        valid = True\n        for friend in perm:\n            # Calculate travel time\n            travel = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n            if travel is None:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            current_time += travel\n            # Convert friend's times to minutes\n            friend_start = time_to_minutes(friend['start'])\n            friend_end = time_to_minutes(friend['end'])\n            # Calculate earliest possible start time\n            earliest_start = max(current_time, friend_start)\n            # Calculate latest possible start time\n            latest_start = friend_end - friend['duration']\n            if earliest_start > latest_start:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            # Schedule the meeting\n            meeting_start = earliest_start\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n            itinerary.append({\n                'action': 'meet',\n                'location': friend['location'],\n                'person': friend['name'],\n                'start_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_start),\n                'end_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n            })\n            # Update current time and location\n            current_time = meeting_end\n            current_location = friend['location']\n        if valid:\n            if len(itinerary) > len(best_itinerary):\n                best_itinerary = itinerary\n            elif len(itinerary) == len(best_itinerary):\n                # If same number, choose the one with earlier end time\n                # Compare the end time of the last meeting\n                if current_time < time_to_minutes(best_itinerary[-1]['end_time']):\n                    best_itinerary = itinerary\n            break  # Found a valid schedule with max possible friends\n\nprint('SOLUTION:')\nprint(json.dumps({'itinerary': best_itinerary}))\n```",
