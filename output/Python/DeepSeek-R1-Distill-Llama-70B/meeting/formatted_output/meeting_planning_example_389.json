            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to plan a meeting schedule for someone visiting San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering their availability and the travel times between locations. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The person starts at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. There are four friends: Sarah, Mary, Helen, and Thomas, each at different locations with specific time windows. Each meeting has a minimum duration requirement. I need to create a schedule that allows meeting as many friends as possible, considering travel times and the time constraints.\n\nSo, the input includes travel times between various districts. I'll need to represent these in a way that the program can access them quickly. Maybe a dictionary where the keys are tuples of the from and to locations, and the value is the travel time.\n\nNext, I need to model each friend's availability. Each has a location, start time, end time, and the required meeting duration. For example, Sarah is at Fisherman's Wharf from 2:45 PM to 5:30 PM, and we need to meet her for at least 105 minutes. Wait, but 5:30 PM minus 2:45 PM is 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is 165 minutes. So, 105 minutes is less than that, so it's possible.\n\nI think the approach should be to try different orders of visiting friends and see which order allows meeting the maximum number of friends, considering both their availability and the travel times between locations.\n\nBut since the number of friends is small (four), perhaps I can generate all possible permutations of the friends and evaluate each permutation to see if it's feasible. The feasible permutations would allow meeting all the friends in that order without violating any time constraints.\n\nWait, but the goal is to meet as many as possible, not necessarily all. So maybe some permutations will allow meeting three friends, others only two, etc. So I need to find the permutation that allows the maximum number of meetings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a greedy approach could work, but I'm not sure. Since the problem is small, generating all permutations might be manageable.\n\nSo, first, I'll represent the friends as a list of dictionaries, each containing their details.\n\nThen, for each possible permutation of these friends, I'll check if it's possible to meet them in that order, considering the travel times and their availability. I'll also need to track the current time and location as I move from one friend to another.\n\nWait, but the starting point is Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. So the first meeting will have to start after 9:00 AM, considering the travel time from Haight-Ashbury to the first friend's location.\n\nSo, for each permutation, I'll simulate the schedule:\n\n1. Start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM.\n2. For each friend in the permutation order:\n   a. Calculate the travel time from the current location to the friend's location.\n   b. Determine the earliest possible arrival time.\n   c. Check if there's enough time to meet the friend for the required duration within their available window.\n   d. If yes, add this meeting to the itinerary, update the current location and time.\n   e. If no, this permutation is invalid, break and try the next permutation.\n\nBut wait, sometimes it's possible that even if the first friend in the permutation can't be met, maybe another permutation allows meeting more friends. So I need to evaluate all possible permutations and find the one that allows the maximum number of meetings.\n\nAlso, for each permutation, I should keep track of how many friends can be met. The permutation that allows the most meetings is the best. If multiple permutations allow the same maximum number, perhaps the one that meets them in the earliest possible order or some other criterion could be chosen, but the problem says to optimize to meet as many as possible, so perhaps the first one found with the maximum is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, maybe some permutations allow meeting more than others. For example, perhaps meeting Mary first, then Thomas, etc., allows for more meetings than another order.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take in the code are:\n\n1. Parse all the input data: travel times, friends' details.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of the friends.\n3. For each permutation, simulate the schedule:\n   a. Start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM.\n   b. For each friend in the permutation:\n      i. Calculate travel time from current location to friend's location.\n      ii. Compute arrival time: current time + travel time.\n      iii. Check if the arrival time is within the friend's available window, and if there's enough time left to meet for the required duration.\n      iv. If yes, schedule the meeting, update current location and time.\n      v. If no, mark this permutation as invalid and move to the next.\n4. Keep track of the best permutation (the one that allows the most meetings).\n5. Once all permutations are evaluated, output the itinerary for the best permutation.\n\nWait, but some friends might have overlapping time windows, so the order in which we visit them matters a lot. For example, if one friend is available only in the morning and another in the afternoon, we have to visit them in the correct order.\n\nBut in this problem, let's look at the friends' available times:\n\n- Sarah: 2:45 PM to 5:30 PM (14:45 to 17:30)\n- Mary: 1:00 PM to 7:15 PM (13:00 to 19:15)\n- Helen: 9:45 PM to 10:30 PM (21:45 to 22:30)\n- Thomas: 3:15 PM to 6:45 PM (15:15 to 18:45)\n\nSo, the earliest any friend is available is Mary at 13:00. So, the first meeting can't be before that.\n\nWait, but the person starts at 9:00 AM. So, they can potentially go to Mary's location (Richmond District) which is 10 minutes away. So, arrival at 9:10 AM. But Mary is only available from 13:00. So, the person would have to wait until 13:00 to meet Mary. But that's a long wait. Alternatively, perhaps they can do other things in the morning before meeting Mary.\n\nWait, but the only friends available in the morning are Helen, but she's available only from 21:45, which is evening. So, perhaps the person can't meet anyone before 13:00 except maybe if they go back to Haight-Ashbury, but that's where they started.\n\nWait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, Sarah is at Fisherman's Wharf from 14:45. So, the earliest possible meeting is with Mary at 13:00.\n\nSo, perhaps the first meeting is with Mary, but let's see.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's structure the code.\n\nFirst, represent the travel times. I'll create a dictionary where the key is a tuple (from_location, to_location), and the value is the travel time in minutes.\n\nThen, represent each friend as a dictionary with their name, location, start time, end time, and required duration.\n\nNext, generate all possible permutations of the friends. Since there are four friends, there are 4! = 24 permutations.\n\nFor each permutation, simulate the schedule:\n\n- Start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM (time = 9*60 = 540 minutes since midnight).\n- current_location = 'Haight-Ashbury'\n- For each friend in the permutation:\n   - Calculate travel_time from current_location to friend's location.\n   - arrival_time = current_time + travel_time\n   - Convert arrival_time to hours and minutes to compare with friend's availability.\n   - Check if arrival_time is before friend's end_time, and that the meeting can fit within their window.\n   - The meeting needs to start at arrival_time, and last for at least the required duration. So, the end_time of the meeting would be arrival_time + required_duration.\n   - But the friend's available until their end_time, so the meeting's end_time must be <= friend's end_time.\n   - Also, the meeting's start_time must be >= friend's start_time.\n\nWait, no. The arrival_time is when we arrive, but the meeting can't start before the friend's start_time. So, the actual meeting start time is the maximum of arrival_time and friend's start_time.\n\nThen, the meeting end time would be meeting_start + required_duration.\n\nIf meeting_end > friend's end_time, then it's not possible to meet this friend in this permutation.\n\nSo, for each friend in the permutation:\n\n1. Compute travel time from current_location to friend's location.\n2. arrival_time = current_time + travel_time.\n3. meeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend's start_time)\n4. meeting_end = meeting_start + required_duration\n5. if meeting_end > friend's end_time: can't meet, permutation invalid.\n6. else: add to itinerary, update current_time to meeting_end, current_location to friend's location.\n\nProceed until all friends in permutation are processed or until one can't be met.\n\nThe permutation is valid if all friends in the permutation can be met. But since the goal is to meet as many as possible, perhaps some permutations allow meeting a subset of friends. So, for each permutation, we need to track how many friends can be met in order.\n\nWait, but the permutation is a specific order. So, for example, if the permutation is [Sarah, Mary, Thomas, Helen], and the first friend (Sarah) can't be met, then the permutation is invalid and we can't meet any of the subsequent friends in this permutation. So, the number of friends met in this permutation is zero.\n\nBut perhaps a different permutation allows meeting some friends. So, for each permutation, we need to go through each friend in order and see how many can be met before hitting a conflict.\n\nWait, no. Because the permutation is a specific order, and if any friend in the sequence can't be met, the rest can't be met in that permutation. Because the current time and location are updated after each meeting, so if a friend can't be met, the schedule can't proceed further in that permutation.\n\nSo, for each permutation, the number of friends met is the number of friends that can be met in sequence until the first failure.\n\nSo, in the code, for each permutation, I'll iterate through each friend, and for each, check if it can be met. If yes, add to the itinerary and proceed. If no, break and note how many were met.\n\nThen, among all permutations, I'll select the one that allows meeting the maximum number of friends.\n\nIf multiple permutations allow the same maximum, I can choose the first one encountered, or perhaps the one that meets them in the earliest possible times. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll just choose the first one that meets the maximum.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the data structures.\n\nFirst, the travel times. I'll create a dictionary, maybe called travel_times, where each key is a tuple (from_loc, to_loc), and the value is the time in minutes.\n\nThen, the friends. Each friend is a dictionary with keys: name, location, start_time, end_time, duration.\n\nWait, but the times are given in hours and minutes. So, I need to convert them into minutes since midnight for easier calculations.\n\nFor example, 9:00 AM is 9*60=540 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, 2:45 PM is 14:45 = 14*60 +45= 885 minutes.\n\nSo, I'll represent all times in minutes since midnight.\n\nSo, for each friend, I'll parse their start and end times into minutes.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\n1. Read the travel times and store them in the travel_times dictionary.\n\n2. Define the friends with their details, converting times into minutes.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the friends.\n\n4. For each permutation:\n   a. Initialize current_time = 540 (9:00 AM), current_location = 'Haight-Ashbury'\n   b. itinerary = []\n   c. for friend in permutation:\n      i. get travel_time from current_location to friend['location']\n      ii. arrival_time = current_time + travel_time\n      iii. meeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend['start_time'])\n      iv. meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n      v. if meeting_end > friend['end_time']: break, can't meet this friend, so permutation fails. Proceed to next permutation.\n      vi. else: add to itinerary, current_time = meeting_end, current_location = friend['location']\n   d. record the number of friends met in this permutation (which is the length of the itinerary)\n   e. keep track of the best permutation (the one with the highest number of friends met)\n\n5. After evaluating all permutations, construct the output JSON with the itinerary of the best permutation.\n\nWait, but what if multiple permutations have the same maximum number of friends met? For example, two permutations each meet three friends. How to choose between them? The problem says to pick the best one, but doesn't specify criteria. So perhaps the first one encountered is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, I'll need to import itertools to generate permutations.\n\nThen, define the travel_times:\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 23,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Richmond District'): 10,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Mission District'): 11,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Bayview'): 18,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 22,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Richmond District'): 18,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Mission District'): 22,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Bayview'): 26,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 10,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 18,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Mission District'): 20,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Bayview'): 26,\n    ('Mission District', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 12,\n    ('Mission District', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 22,\n    ('Mission District', 'Richmond District'): 20,\n    ('Mission District', 'Bayview'): 15,\n    ('Bayview', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 19,\n    ('Bayview', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 25,\n    ('Bayview', 'Richmond District'): 25,\n    ('Bayview', 'Mission District'): 13,\n}\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the travel times are given in both directions. So, for example, Haight-Ashbury to Fisherman's Wharf is 23, and Fisherman's Wharf to Haight-Ashbury is 22. So, I need to include both directions in the dictionary.\n\nNow, the friends:\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Sarah',\n        'location': 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf',\n        'start_time': 14*60 +45,  # 2:45 PM\n        'end_time': 17*60 +30,    # 5:30 PM\n        'duration': 105\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Mary',\n        'location': 'Richmond District',\n        'start_time': 13*60 +0,   # 1:00 PM\n        'end_time': 19*60 +15,    # 7:15 PM\n        'duration': 75\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Helen',\n        'location': 'Mission District',\n        'start_time': 21*60 +45,  # 9:45 PM\n        'end_time': 22*60 +30,    # 10:30 PM\n        'duration': 30\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Thomas',\n        'location': 'Bayview',\n        'start_time': 15*60 +15,  # 3:15 PM\n        'end_time': 18*60 +45,    # 6:45 PM\n        'duration': 120\n    },\n]\n\nWait, but wait: Helen is at Mission District from 9:45 PM to 10:30 PM, which is 21:45 to 22:30. So, her start time is 21*60+45=1305 minutes, end time 22*60+30=1350.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImport necessary modules:\n\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\nThen, define the travel_times and friends as above.\n\nNext, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(friends):\n\nBut wait, itertools.permutations(friends) will generate all possible orderings of the friends list, which is four elements, so 24 permutations.\n\nFor each permutation, simulate the schedule.\n\nInitialize variables to track the best itinerary:\n\nbest_itinerary = []\nmax_met = 0\n\nFor each perm in permutations:\n\ncurrent_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\ncurrent_location = 'Haight-Ashbury'\nitinerary = []\nfor friend in perm:\n    # Get travel time\n    travel_time = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n    if travel_time is None:\n        # Shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n        break\n    arrival_time = current_time + travel_time\n    # Compute meeting start time\n    meeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend['start_time'])\n    meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n    if meeting_end > friend['end_time']:\n        # Can't meet this friend, break permutation\n        break\n    # Add to itinerary\n    itinerary.append({\n        'action': 'meet',\n        'location': friend['location'],\n        'person': friend['name'],\n        'start_time': convert_minutes_to_time(meeting_start),\n        'end_time': convert_minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n    })\n    # Update current time and location\n    current_time = meeting_end\n    current_location = friend['location']\n# After processing all friends in permutation\nif len(itinerary) > max_met:\n    max_met = len(itinerary)\n    best_itinerary = itinerary\n\nWait, but this code would only consider the friends in the order of the permutation. If in the permutation, the first friend can't be met, then the itinerary is empty, and the permutation is skipped.\n\nBut perhaps a different permutation allows meeting more friends. So, after evaluating all permutations, the best_itinerary will have the maximum number of friends met.\n\nBut wait, what if a permutation allows meeting three friends, but another allows meeting four? The code will correctly capture the one with four.\n\nBut in this specific problem, is it possible to meet all four friends?\n\nLet me think about the time constraints.\n\nLet me try to see if it's possible to meet all four.\n\nSuppose the order is Mary -> Thomas -> Sarah -> Helen.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nStart at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM (540 minutes).\n\n1. Meet Mary in Richmond District.\n\nTravel time from Haight-Ashbury to Richmond is 10 minutes. So arrival at 540 +10 = 550 minutes (9:10 AM).\n\nMary is available from 13:00 (780 minutes) to 19:15 (1155). So meeting can start at 780.\n\nMeeting duration is 75 minutes. So ends at 780 +75 = 855 minutes (14:15).\n\nSo, itinerary entry: meet Mary from 13:00 to 14:15.\n\nCurrent time: 855, location: Richmond.\n\n2. Next, Thomas in Bayview.\n\nTravel time from Richmond to Bayview: 26 minutes. So arrival at 855 +26 = 881 (14:41).\n\nThomas is available from 15:15 (915) to 18:45 (1125). So meeting starts at max(881, 915) = 915.\n\nMeeting duration: 120 minutes. Ends at 915 +120 = 1035 (17:15).\n\nCheck if 1035 <= 1125: yes.\n\nItinerary: meet Thomas 15:15 to 17:15.\n\nCurrent time: 1035, location: Bayview.\n\n3. Next, Sarah in Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nTravel time from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25 minutes. Arrival at 1035 +25 = 1060 (17:40).\n\nSarah is available from 14:45 (885) to 17:30 (1050). Wait, 17:40 is after 17:30, so can't meet her.\n\nSo, this permutation fails to meet Sarah.\n\nSo, in this permutation, only Mary and Thomas are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different permutation would allow meeting more.\n\nWait, let's try another order: Mary -> Sarah -> Thomas -> Helen.\n\nStart at Haight-Ashbury at 540.\n\n1. Mary: arrival at 550 (9:10 AM). Meeting starts at 780 (13:00), ends 855 (14:15).\n\n2. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf: from Richmond to Fisherman's Wharf is 18 minutes. So arrival at 855 +18 = 873 (14:33).\n\nSarah is available from 885 (14:45) to 1050 (17:30). So meeting starts at max(873, 885) = 885.\n\nMeeting duration 105: ends at 885 +105 = 990 (16:30).\n\nCheck if 990 <= 1050: yes.\n\nItinerary: meet Sarah 14:45 to 16:30.\n\nCurrent time: 990, location: Fisherman's Wharf.\n\n3. Travel to Bayview: from Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26 minutes. Arrival at 990 +26 = 1016 (16:56).\n\nThomas is available until 18:45 (1125). So meeting starts at 1016.\n\nMeeting duration 120: ends at 1016 +120 = 1136 (18:56), which is after Thomas's end time of 18:45 (1125). So can't meet Thomas.\n\nSo, this permutation only meets Mary and Sarah.\n\nHmm. What about another order: Thomas -> Sarah -> Mary -> Helen?\n\nWait, Thomas is available from 15:15 (915) to 18:45 (1125). Let's see.\n\nStart at 540, Haight-Ashbury.\n\n1. Thomas: location Bayview.\n\nTravel time from Haight to Bayview: 18 minutes. Arrival 540 +18 = 558 (9:18 AM).\n\nBut Thomas is available from 915. So meeting starts at 915.\n\nDuration 120: ends at 1035 (17:15).\n\nItinerary: meet Thomas 15:15 to 17:15.\n\nCurrent time: 1035, location: Bayview.\n\n2. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf: 25 minutes. Arrival 1035 +25 = 1060 (17:40).\n\nSarah is available until 17:30 (1050), so can't meet.\n\nSo, permutation fails.\n\nAnother permutation: Sarah -> Mary -> Thomas -> Helen.\n\nStart at Haight.\n\n1. Sarah: location Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nTravel time 23 mins. Arrival 540 +23 = 563 (9:23 AM).\n\nSarah is available from 885 (14:45). So meeting starts at 885.\n\nDuration 105: ends at 990 (16:30).\n\nItinerary: meet Sarah 14:45-16:30.\n\nCurrent time: 990, location: Fisherman's Wharf.\n\n2. Travel to Mary's location (Richmond): 18 mins. Arrival 990 +18 = 1008 (16:48).\n\nMary is available until 19:15 (1155). So meeting starts at 1008.\n\nDuration 75: ends at 1008 +75 = 1083 (18:03).\n\nItinerary: meet Mary 16:48-18:03.\n\nCurrent time: 1083, location: Richmond.\n\n3. Travel to Thomas's location (Bayview): 26 mins. Arrival 1083 +26 = 1109 (18:29).\n\nThomas is available until 18:45 (1125). So meeting starts at 1109.\n\nDuration 120: ends at 1109 +120 = 1229 (20:29), which is after Thomas's end time of 18:45 (1125). So can't meet Thomas.\n\nSo, this permutation meets Sarah and Mary.\n\nHmm. What about Helen? She's available only in the evening. So, perhaps after meeting others, can we meet Helen?\n\nFor example, permutation: Mary -> Thomas -> Sarah -> Helen.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nStart at 540.\n\n1. Mary: arrival 550, meeting starts 780, ends 855.\n\n2. Travel to Thomas's location (Bayview): from Richmond to Bayview is 26 mins. Arrival 855 +26 = 881 (14:41).\n\nThomas is available from 915. So meeting starts at 915, ends 1035.\n\n3. Travel to Sarah's location: from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 mins. Arrival 1035 +25 = 1060 (17:40).\n\nSarah's available until 17:30, so can't meet.\n\nSo, permutation meets Mary and Thomas.\n\nBut maybe another permutation allows meeting three friends.\n\nWait, let's try permutation: Mary -> Thomas -> Helen -> Sarah.\n\nWait, but Helen is at Mission District, and Sarah is at Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Mary and Thomas, can we go to Helen?\n\nAfter Thomas, current time is 1035, location Bayview.\n\nTravel to Helen's location (Mission District): Bayview to Mission is 13 mins. Arrival 1035 +13 = 1048 (17:28).\n\nHelen is available from 21:45 (1305) to 22:30 (1350). So arrival is 17:28, which is before her start time. So meeting starts at 1305.\n\nBut the required duration is 30 mins. So ends at 1305 +30 = 1335 (22:15), which is within her end time.\n\nSo, itinerary: meet Helen 21:45-22:15.\n\nCurrent time: 1335, location: Mission District.\n\nThen, travel to Sarah's location: Mission to Fisherman's Wharf is 22 mins. Arrival 1335 +22 = 1357 (22:57), which is after Sarah's end time (17:30). So can't meet Sarah.\n\nSo, in this permutation, we meet Mary, Thomas, Helen. That's three friends.\n\nIs that possible? Let me check the times:\n\nMary: 13:00-14:15.\n\nThomas: 15:15-17:15.\n\nHelen: 21:45-22:15.\n\nYes, that's three meetings.\n\nSo, the permutation [Mary, Thomas, Helen] would allow meeting three friends.\n\nBut wait, in the permutation, after Helen, can we meet Sarah? No, because it's too late.\n\nSo, this permutation meets three friends.\n\nIs there a permutation that allows four?\n\nLet me think. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the order is Mary -> Thomas -> Sarah -> Helen.\n\nWe already saw that Sarah can't be met because after Thomas, arrival at Fisherman's Wharf is 17:40, which is after Sarah's end time of 17:30.\n\nBut what if the order is Mary -> Sarah -> Thomas -> Helen?\n\nLet me simulate:\n\n1. Mary: meets 13:00-14:15.\n\n2. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf: 18 mins. Arrival 14:15 +18 = 14:33 (855 +18=873, which is 14:33).\n\nSarah's available from 14:45. So meeting starts at 14:45, ends 15:30 (14:45 +105=990).\n\n3. Travel to Thomas's location (Bayview): from Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26 mins. Arrival 990 +26 = 1016 (16:56).\n\nThomas is available until 18:45. So meeting starts at 16:56, ends 16:56 +120= 17:56 (which is 17:56, within 18:45).\n\nSo, meet Thomas 16:56-17:56.\n\n4. Travel to Helen's location (Mission District): from Bayview to Mission is 13 mins. Arrival 17:56 +13 = 18:09.\n\nHelen is available from 21:45. So arrival is 18:09, which is before her start. So meeting starts at 21:45, ends 22:15.\n\nSo, in this permutation, we meet Mary, Sarah, Thomas, Helen. That's four friends!\n\nWait, but let's check the times:\n\nMary: 13:00-14:15.\n\nSarah: 14:45-15:30.\n\nWait, no. Wait, Sarah's meeting starts at 14:45, ends at 14:45 +105=15:30 (990 minutes). Then, travel to Bayview: 26 mins, arrival at 990 +26=1016 (16:56). Then, meet Thomas from 16:56 to 17:56 (1016 +120=1136, which is 18:56? Wait, no: 16:56 +120 mins is 18:56, but Thomas is available until 18:45 (1125). So, 18:56 is after 18:45. So, can't meet Thomas in this case.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nAfter meeting Sarah, current time is 990 (16:30). Travel to Bayview is 26 mins, so arrival at 990 +26 = 1016 (16:56).\n\nThomas's end time is 18:45 (1125). So, meeting starts at 1016, ends at 1016 +120 = 1136 (18:56), which is after 18:45. So, can't meet Thomas.\n\nSo, this permutation only meets Mary and Sarah.\n\nHmm, so that permutation doesn't work.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried the permutation Mary -> Thomas -> Helen, I could meet three friends. Let me see if there's a way to meet all four.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another permutation.\n\nLet me try permutation: Mary -> Thomas -> Sarah -> Helen.\n\n1. Mary: 13:00-14:15.\n\n2. Travel to Thomas's location (Bayview): 26 mins. Arrival 14:15 +26=14:41 (881).\n\nThomas available from 15:15. So meeting starts 15:15, ends 15:15+120=17:15 (1035).\n\n3. Travel to Sarah's location (Fisherman's Wharf): from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 mins. Arrival 1035 +25=1060 (17:40).\n\nSarah's available until 17:30 (1050). So can't meet.\n\nSo, only two meetings.\n\nAnother permutation: Mary -> Sarah -> Thomas -> Helen.\n\nAs before, can't meet Thomas.\n\nAnother permutation: Thomas -> Mary -> Sarah -> Helen.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. Thomas: arrival at Bayview at 9:18 AM (558). But Thomas is available from 15:15. So meeting starts at 15:15, ends 17:15.\n\n2. Travel to Mary's location (Richmond): from Bayview to Richmond is 25 mins (since Bayview to Richmond is 25 mins as per the travel times? Wait, no, looking back, the travel times from Bayview to Richmond District is 25 mins.\n\nWait, the travel_times for ('Bayview', 'Richmond District') is 25.\n\nSo, arrival at 17:15 +25=17:40 (1060).\n\nMary is available until 19:15 (1155). So meeting starts at 17:40, ends 17:40 +75=18:55 (18:55 < 19:15). So, meet Mary 17:40-18:55.\n\n3. Travel to Sarah's location: from Richmond to Fisherman's Wharf is 18 mins. Arrival 18:55 +18=19:13 (1153).\n\nSarah is available until 17:30, so can't meet.\n\nSo, this permutation meets Thomas and Mary.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother permutation: Sarah -> Mary -> Thomas -> Helen.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. Sarah: arrival at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:23 AM (563). But Sarah is available from 14:45. So meeting starts at 14:45, ends 15:30.\n\n2. Travel to Mary's location (Richmond): 18 mins. Arrival 15:30 +18=15:48 (948).\n\nMary is available until 19:15. So meeting starts at 15:48, ends 15:48 +75=16:63, which is 17:03 (963).\n\n3. Travel to Thomas's location (Bayview): from Richmond to Bayview is 26 mins. Arrival 17:03 +26=17:29 (1049).\n\nThomas is available until 18:45. So meeting starts at 17:29, ends 17:29 +120=19:49 (1189), which is after Thomas's end time of 18:45 (1125). So can't meet Thomas.\n\nThus, only two meetings.\n\nHmm, seems challenging to meet all four friends. Maybe it's not possible. So, the best possible is three friends.\n\nIn the earlier permutation, Mary -> Thomas -> Helen allows three meetings.\n\nLet me check the times again:\n\n1. Mary: 13:00-14:15.\n\n2. Thomas: 15:15-17:15.\n\n3. Helen: 21:45-22:15.\n\nYes, that's three.\n\nNow, can we fit in Sarah somewhere?\n\nWait, after meeting Helen, can we go to Sarah? No, because Sarah's available until 17:30, and Helen's meeting ends at 22:15, which is way after.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different order allows meeting Sarah and Helen.\n\nWait, another permutation: Mary -> Sarah -> Helen -> Thomas.\n\nBut after meeting Sarah, can we meet Helen?\n\nLet me see:\n\n1. Mary: 13:00-14:15.\n\n2. Sarah: arrival at 14:33 (855 +18=873, which is 14:33). Sarah's available from 14:45. So meeting starts at 14:45, ends 15:30.\n\n3. Travel to Helen's location (Mission District): from Fisherman's Wharf to Mission is 22 mins. Arrival 15:30 +22=15:52 (952).\n\nHelen is available from 21:45. So meeting starts at 21:45, ends 22:15.\n\n4. Travel to Thomas's location (Bayview): from Mission to Bayview is 15 mins. Arrival 22:15 +15=22:30.\n\nThomas's available until 18:45, so can't meet.\n\nSo, this permutation meets Mary, Sarah, Helen: three friends.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum is three.\n\nSo, the code should find a permutation that allows three meetings.\n\nBut in the code, when evaluating all permutations, it will find the one with the maximum number of friends met.\n\nSo, now, the code needs to correctly handle the time conversions and the logic.\n\nNow, I need to write a function to convert minutes since midnight to a time string in H:MM format without leading zero.\n\nFor example, 9:00 AM is 540 minutes, which should be '9:00'.\n\n14:45 is 885 minutes, '14:45'.\n\nSo, the function could be:\n\ndef convert_minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nWait, but in Python, f-strings can format with leading zeros. So, for example, 9:05 would be '9:05', and 10:5 would be '10:05'?\n\nWait, no, 10:5 is 10:05, so using :02d ensures two digits.\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut in the code, after evaluating all permutations, the best_itinerary is the one with the maximum number of friends met.\n\nOnce that's determined, the output is a JSON object with the itinerary.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 23,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Richmond District'): 10,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Mission District'): 11,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Bayview'): 18,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 22,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Richmond District'): 18,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Mission District'): 22,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Bayview'): 26,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 10,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 18,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Mission District'): 20,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Bayview'): 26,\n    ('Mission District', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 12,\n    ('Mission District', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 22,\n    ('Mission District', 'Richmond District'): 20,\n    ('Mission District', 'Bayview'): 15,\n    ('Bayview', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 19,\n    ('Bayview', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 25,\n    ('Bayview', 'Richmond District'): 25,\n    ('Bayview', 'Mission District'): 13,\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Sarah',\n        'location': 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf',\n        'start_time': 14*60 +45,  # 2:45 PM\n        'end_time': 17*60 +30,    # 5:30 PM\n        'duration': 105\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Mary',\n        'location': 'Richmond District',\n        'start_time': 13*60 +0,   # 1:00 PM\n        'end_time': 19*60 +15,    # 7:15 PM\n        'duration': 75\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Helen',\n        'location': 'Mission District',\n        'start_time': 21*60 +45,  # 9:45 PM\n        'end_time': 22*60 +30,    # 10:30 PM\n        'duration': 30\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Thomas',\n        'location': 'Bayview',\n        'start_time': 15*60 +15,  # 3:15 PM\n        'end_time': 18*60 +45,    # 6:45 PM\n        'duration': 120\n    },\n]\n\ndef convert_minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nbest_itinerary = []\nmax_met = 0\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n    current_location = 'Haight-Ashbury'\n    itinerary = []\n    for friend in perm:\n        # Get travel time\n        travel_time = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n        if travel_time is None:\n            break  # Shouldn't happen\n        arrival_time = current_time + travel_time\n        meeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend['start_time'])\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n        if meeting_end > friend['end_time']:\n            break  # Can't meet this friend\n        # Add to itinerary\n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': convert_minutes_to_time(meeting_start),\n            'end_time': convert_minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n        })\n        current_time = meeting_end\n        current_location = friend['location']\n    if len(itinerary) > max_met:\n        max_met = len(itinerary)\n        best_itinerary = itinerary\n\n# Generate the output\noutput = {\n    \"itinerary\": best_itinerary\n}\n\n# Print the JSON\nprint(json.dumps(output, indent=2))\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to plan an optimal meeting schedule for a day in San Francisco, considering the constraints of each friend's availability and travel times between locations. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, starting from Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parameters**: We are given travel times between various districts and the availability of four friends along with the minimum meeting duration required for each.\n2. **Travel Times**: Represented as a dictionary where keys are tuples of locations and values are travel times in minutes.\n3. **Friends' Details**: Each friend is represented as a dictionary containing their name, location, available start and end times, and required meeting duration.\n4. **Permutations**: Generate all possible permutations of the friends to explore every possible meeting order.\n5. **Simulation**: For each permutation, simulate the schedule starting from Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. Calculate travel times, check if meetings can fit within the friend's availability, and keep track of the best schedule that meets the most friends.\n6. **Time Conversion**: Convert minutes since midnight to a readable time format for the output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 23,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Richmond District'): 10,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Mission District'): 11,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Bayview'): 18,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 22,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Richmond District'): 18,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Mission District'): 22,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Bayview'): 26,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 10,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 18,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Mission District'): 20,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Bayview'): 26,\n    ('Mission District', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 12,\n    ('Mission District', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 22,\n    ('Mission District', 'Richmond District'): 20,\n    ('Mission District', 'Bayview'): 15,\n    ('Bayview', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 19,\n    ('Bayview', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 25,\n    ('Bayview', 'Richmond District'): 25,\n    ('Bayview', 'Mission District'): 13,\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Sarah',\n        'location': 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf',\n        'start_time': 14 * 60 + 45,  # 2:45 PM\n        'end_time': 17 * 60 + 30,    # 5:30 PM\n        'duration': 105\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Mary',\n        'location': 'Richmond District',\n        'start_time': 13 * 60 + 0,   # 1:00 PM\n        'end_time': 19 * 60 + 15,    # 7:15 PM\n        'duration': 75\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Helen',\n        'location': 'Mission District',\n        'start_time': 21 * 60 + 45,  # 9:45 PM\n        'end_time': 22 * 60 + 30,    # 10:30 PM\n        'duration': 30\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Thomas',\n        'location': 'Bayview',\n        'start_time': 15 * 60 + 15,  # 3:15 PM\n        'end_time': 18 * 60 + 45,    # 6:45 PM\n        'duration': 120\n    },\n]\n\ndef convert_minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nbest_itinerary = []\nmax_met = 0\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n    current_location = 'Haight-Ashbury'\n    itinerary = []\n    for friend in perm:\n        travel_time = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n        if travel_time is None:\n            break\n        arrival_time = current_time + travel_time\n        meeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend['start_time'])\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n        if meeting_end > friend['end_time']:\n            break\n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': convert_minutes_to_time(meeting_start),\n            'end_time': convert_minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n        })\n        current_time = meeting_end\n        current_location = friend['location']\n    if len(itinerary) > max_met:\n        max_met = len(itinerary)\n        best_itinerary = itinerary\n\noutput = {\n    \"itinerary\": best_itinerary\n}\n\nprint(json.dumps(output, indent=2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Travel Times and Friends' Details**: The travel times between locations and friends' availability are stored in dictionaries for easy access.\n2. **Permutations**: All possible orders of meeting friends are generated using permutations to explore every possible schedule.\n3. **Simulation**: For each permutation, the schedule is simulated starting from Haight-Ashbury.
