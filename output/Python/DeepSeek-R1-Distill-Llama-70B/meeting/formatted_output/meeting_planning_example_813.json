            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on various constraints. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the problem statement carefully. The user is in San Francisco and wants to meet as many friends as possible. Each friend is at a specific location during certain times, and each meeting has a minimum duration. The program must compute the best schedule considering travel times between locations.\n\nSo, the input parameters include travel times between different districts and the constraints for each friend. The output should be a JSON-formatted itinerary with the meetings scheduled optimally.\n\nI think the approach here is to model this as a scheduling problem where each meeting is an event with a start and end time, and we need to fit as many as possible without overlapping, considering travel times.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the friends and their constraints:\n\n- Joshua at Embarcadero from 9:45 AM to 6:00 PM, needs at least 105 minutes.\n- Jeffrey at Bayview from 9:45 AM to 8:15 PM, needs 75 minutes.\n- Charles at Union Square from 10:45 AM to 8:15 PM, needs 120 minutes.\n- Joseph at Chinatown from 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM, needs 60 minutes.\n- Elizabeth at Sunset District from 9:00 AM to 9:45 AM, needs 45 minutes.\n- Matthew at Golden Gate Park from 11:00 AM to 7:30 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n- Carol at Financial District from 10:45 AM to 11:15 AM, needs 15 minutes.\n- Paul at Haight-Ashbury from 7:15 PM to 8:30 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n- Rebecca at Mission District from 5:00 PM to 9:45 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n\nThe user starts at Marina District at 9:00 AM. So the initial location is Marina, and the start time is 9:00.\n\nI need to plan meetings in such a way that each meeting is scheduled within the person's available time, the duration is met, and the travel time from the previous location is considered.\n\nI think a greedy approach might work here, but I'm not sure. Maybe prioritize meetings that are time-critical or have longer durations. Alternatively, perhaps we should sort the meetings by their end times or start times and fit them in.\n\nBut considering that each meeting's location affects the next possible location due to travel time, it's a bit more complex. So, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node is a possible meeting, and edges represent the possibility to go from one meeting to another considering travel time and availability.\n\nWait, but that might get complicated with so many possibilities. Maybe a better approach is to generate all possible permutations of the friends and check which permutation fits without time conflicts, but that's computationally expensive, especially since there are 9 friends. 9! is 362880 permutations, which might be manageable but could be optimized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a backtracking approach, trying to add each possible meeting in each step and checking if it's feasible.\n\nBut considering that the problem requires the program to compute the schedule, I need to implement an algorithm that can find the optimal solution.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Parse all the travel times into a data structure, maybe a dictionary where the key is a tuple of (from, to) and the value is the time in minutes.\n\n2. For each friend, create a meeting object with their location, available start and end times, and required duration.\n\n3. The goal is to select a subset of these meetings and order them such that:\n   a. Each meeting starts after the previous meeting ends plus travel time.\n   b. Each meeting fits within the person's available time window.\n   c. The total number of meetings is maximized, and if there's a tie, perhaps the total time spent is maximized.\n\n4. Since the user starts at Marina at 9:00 AM, the first meeting must start after 9:00 plus any travel time to the first location.\n\nSo, I'll need to process each possible meeting, check if it can be added to the current schedule, and proceed.\n\nBut how do I decide the order? Maybe the order that allows the most meetings is the one that schedules the earliest possible meetings first, especially those with tight time windows.\n\nLooking at the constraints, Elizabeth is only available until 9:45 AM, and her meeting requires 45 minutes. So, to meet her, the latest we can arrive is 9:00 AM (since 9:00 +45 =9:45). But since we start at Marina at 9:00, we need to check the travel time from Marina to Sunset District.\n\nLooking at the travel times, Marina to Sunset is 19 minutes. So, if we go to Sunset first, we arrive at 9:19 AM. Then, meeting Elizabeth from 9:19 to 9:19+45=10:04. But wait, Elizabeth is only available until 9:45. So 9:19 +45 is 10:04, which is beyond her end time. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, perhaps we can't meet Elizabeth because the earliest we can arrive is 9:19, and her available time ends at 9:45. So the meeting would have to end by 9:45, meaning the meeting can only be from 9:19 to 9:45, which is 26 minutes, but she needs 45. So it's impossible. Therefore, Elizabeth can't be met.\n\nHmm, that's a key point. So, Elizabeth's meeting isn't possible because even if we leave immediately, the travel time makes it so that we can't meet for the required 45 minutes within her available time.\n\nSo, Elizabeth is out. So, the first possible meetings after 9:00 would be those whose locations can be reached in time.\n\nWait, let's check the travel times again. Marina to Sunset is 19 minutes, so arriving at 9:19. Elizabeth is available until 9:45. So, the latest we can start the meeting is 9:45 - 45 minutes = 8:00 AM, but we can't arrive before 9:19. So, it's impossible.\n\nSo, Elizabeth can't be met. So, we can remove her from consideration.\n\nNext, let's look at Joseph, who is at Chinatown from 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM. He needs 60 minutes. Marina to Chinatown is 15 minutes. So, if we go there first, we arrive at 9:15. We can meet him from 9:15 to 10:15, which is within his available time. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can meet Joseph later, but since he's available for a long time, maybe it's better to meet him first.\n\nWait, but maybe other friends have tighter time constraints. For example, Carol is only available from 10:45 to 11:15, needing 15 minutes. So, she's only available for a short time. So, perhaps we should prioritize her.\n\nBut let's see. If we go to Carol first, Marina to Financial District is 17 minutes. So, arriving at 9:17. But Carol is available from 10:45. So, we can't meet her until then. So, perhaps it's better to do other meetings before her.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to prioritize meetings with the earliest end times or the tightest time windows.\n\nSo, let's list all the friends and their time windows:\n\n- Joseph: 7:00-15:30 (3:30 PM)\n- Elizabeth: 9:00-9:45 (can't meet)\n- Joshua: 9:45-18:00 (6 PM)\n- Jeffrey: 9:45-20:15 (8:15 PM)\n- Charles: 10:45-20:15\n- Carol: 10:45-11:15\n- Matthew: 11:00-19:30 (7:30 PM)\n- Paul: 19:15-20:30 (7:15 PM to 8:30 PM)\n- Rebecca: 17:00-21:45 (5 PM to 9:45 PM)\n\nSo, the tightest time windows are:\n\n- Carol: only 30 minutes (10:45-11:15)\n- Elizabeth: can't meet\n- Paul: 1.25 hours (7:15 PM to 8:30 PM)\n- Rebecca: 4.75 hours (5 PM to 9:45 PM)\n- Matthew: 8.5 hours (11 AM to 7:30 PM)\n- Charles: 9.5 hours (10:45 AM to 8:15 PM)\n- Jeffrey: 10.5 hours (9:45 AM to 8:15 PM)\n- Joshua: 10.25 hours (9:45 AM to 6 PM)\n- Joseph: 8.5 hours (7 AM to 3:30 PM)\n\nSo, Carol has the tightest window. So, perhaps we should schedule her first if possible.\n\nBut wait, she's available from 10:45 to 11:15. So, we need to arrive there by 10:45 at the latest, but considering the travel time from the previous location.\n\nWait, but the user starts at Marina at 9:00. So, perhaps we can schedule a meeting before Carol's time.\n\nLet me think about possible first meetings:\n\nOption 1: Meet Joseph at Chinatown. Marina to Chinatown is 15 minutes. So arrive at 9:15. Meet from 9:15 to 10:15 (60 mins). Then, after that, where to go?\n\nOption 2: Meet Joshua at Embarcadero. Marina to Embarcadero is 14 mins. Arrive at 9:14. His available time starts at 9:45, so we can start meeting at 9:45. But that's a wait of 31 minutes. Alternatively, perhaps we can go somewhere else first.\n\nWait, but if we go to Embarcadero first, arriving at 9:14, but Joshua is available from 9:45. So, we can't meet him until 9:45. So, perhaps it's better to do another meeting before that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can go to Union Square. Marina to Union Square is 16 mins. Arrive at 9:16. Charles is available from 10:45. So, we have to wait until 10:45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can go to Financial District for Carol. Marina to Financial District is 17 mins, arrive at 9:17. But Carol is available from 10:45. So, we have to wait until 10:45.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the best first meeting is Joseph at Chinatown, since it's the earliest possible and doesn't require waiting.\n\nSo, let's plan:\n\n9:00 - leave Marina.\n\n9:15 - arrive Chinatown.\n\nMeet Joseph from 9:15 to 10:15 (60 mins).\n\nAfter that, where to go? Let's see the next possible meetings.\n\nAfter 10:15, we can go to Financial District for Carol. Chinatown to Financial District is 5 minutes (from the data: Chinatown to Financial District is 5). So, arrive at 10:20.\n\nCarol is available from 10:45 to 11:15. So, we can meet her from 10:45 to 11:00 (15 mins). But wait, we arrive at 10:20. So, we can start earlier? No, because she's not available until 10:45.\n\nSo, we have to wait until 10:45. So, the meeting is from 10:45 to 11:00.\n\nThen, after that, where to go? Let's see.\n\nFrom Financial District, possible next meetings:\n\n- Matthew at Golden Gate Park: needs 45 mins, available from 11:00.\n\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23 mins. So, arrive at 11:23.\n\nMatthew is available from 11:00, so we can start at 11:23. Meeting ends at 11:23 +45 = 12:08.\n\nThen, after that, perhaps go to Union Square for Charles, who needs 120 mins.\n\nGolden Gate Park to Union Square is 22 mins. Arrive at 12:30.\n\nCharles is available from 10:45 to 20:15. So, we can start at 12:30. Meeting ends at 12:30 +120 = 14:30.\n\nThen, next, perhaps go to Embarcadero for Joshua. Union Square to Embarcadero is 11 mins. Arrive at 14:41.\n\nJoshua is available until 18:00. So, we can start at 14:41. He needs 105 mins, so ends at 15:46.\n\nThen, after that, perhaps go to Bayview for Jeffrey. Embarcadero to Bayview is 21 mins. Arrive at 16:07.\n\nJeffrey is available until 20:15. So, start at 16:07, ends at 16:07 +75=17:22.\n\nThen, next, perhaps go to Haight-Ashbury for Paul. Bayview to Haight-Ashbury is 19 mins. Arrive at 17:41.\n\nPaul is available from 19:15. So, we have to wait until 19:15. So, meeting starts at 19:15, ends at 19:30.\n\nThen, finally, go to Mission District for Rebecca. Haight-Ashbury to Mission District is 11 mins. Arrive at 19:41.\n\nRebecca is available until 21:45. So, meeting starts at 19:41, ends at 19:41 +45=20:26.\n\nWait, but let's check the times:\n\n- Joseph: 9:15-10:15\n- Carol: 10:45-11:00\n- Matthew: 11:23-12:08\n- Charles:12:30-14:30\n- Joshua:14:41-15:46\n- Jeffrey:16:07-17:22\n- Paul:19:15-19:30\n- Rebecca:19:41-20:26\n\nThat's 8 meetings, but wait, let's count:\n\n1. Joseph\n2. Carol\n3. Matthew\n4. Charles\n5. Joshua\n6. Jeffrey\n7. Paul\n8. Rebecca\n\nBut wait, can we fit all of them? Let's check the travel times and ensure that each meeting starts after the previous ends plus travel.\n\nLet me re-calculate each step with precise timings.\n\nStart at Marina at 9:00.\n\n1. Joseph:\n   - Travel: 15 mins. Arrive at 9:15.\n   - Meeting: 9:15 to 10:15 (60 mins).\n   - End at 10:15.\n\n2. Travel to Financial District:\n   - Chinatown to Financial District is 5 mins. Depart 10:15, arrive 10:20.\n   - But Carol is available from 10:45. So, wait until 10:45.\n   - Meeting: 10:45 to 11:00 (15 mins).\n   - End at 11:00.\n\n3. Travel to Golden Gate Park:\n   - Financial District to Golden Gate Park: 23 mins. Depart 11:00, arrive 11:23.\n   - Matthew is available from 11:00, so start at 11:23.\n   - Meeting: 11:23 to 12:08 (45 mins).\n   - End at 12:08.\n\n4. Travel to Union Square:\n   - Golden Gate Park to Union Square: 22 mins. Depart 12:08, arrive 12:30.\n   - Charles is available from 10:45, so start at 12:30.\n   - Meeting: 12:30 to 14:30 (120 mins).\n   - End at 14:30.\n\n5. Travel to Embarcadero:\n   - Union Square to Embarcadero: 11 mins. Depart 14:30, arrive 14:41.\n   - Joshua is available from 9:45, so start at 14:41.\n   - Meeting: 14:41 to 15:46 (105 mins).\n   - End at 15:46.\n\n6. Travel to Bayview:\n   - Embarcadero to Bayview: 21 mins. Depart 15:46, arrive 16:07.\n   - Jeffrey is available from 9:45, so start at 16:07.\n   - Meeting: 16:07 to 17:22 (75 mins).\n   - End at 17:22.\n\n7. Travel to Haight-Ashbury:\n   - Bayview to Haight-Ashbury: 19 mins. Depart 17:22, arrive 17:41.\n   - Paul is available from 19:15, so wait until 19:15.\n   - Meeting: 19:15 to 19:30 (15 mins).\n   - End at 19:30.\n\n8. Travel to Mission District:\n   - Haight-Ashbury to Mission District: 12 mins. Depart 19:30, arrive 19:42.\n   - Rebecca is available from 17:00, so start at 19:42.\n   - Meeting: 19:42 to 20:27 (45 mins).\n   - End at 20:27.\n\nWait, but Rebecca's end time is 21:45, so 20:27 is fine.\n\nBut let's check each step for any overlaps or issues.\n\nWait, in step 7, after arriving at Haight-Ashbury at 17:41, we have to wait until 19:15 to meet Paul. That's a 1h34m wait. That's a lot of time. Maybe we can fit another meeting in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after Jeffrey in Bayview (ends at 17:22), we can go to another location instead of waiting until Paul's time.\n\nLooking at the remaining friends, after Jeffrey, we have Paul and Rebecca.\n\nRebecca is available from 17:00, so perhaps we can go to her next.\n\nSo, after Jeffrey ends at 17:22, travel to Mission District.\n\nBayview to Mission District: 13 mins. Depart 17:22, arrive 17:35.\n\nRebecca is available from 17:00, so start meeting at 17:35. Ends at 17:35 +45=18:20.\n\nThen, after that, go to Haight-Ashbury for Paul.\n\nMission District to Haight-Ashbury: 12 mins. Depart 18:20, arrive 18:32.\n\nPaul is available from 19:15, so wait until then. Meeting from 19:15 to 19:30.\n\nSo, this way, we can meet Rebecca earlier and avoid the long wait.\n\nSo, the revised itinerary would be:\n\n1. Joseph: 9:15-10:15\n2. Carol: 10:45-11:00\n3. Matthew:11:23-12:08\n4. Charles:12:30-14:30\n5. Joshua:14:41-15:46\n6. Jeffrey:16:07-17:22\n7. Rebecca:17:35-18:20\n8. Paul:19:15-19:30\n\nThat's 8 meetings, same as before, but with better timing.\n\nWait, but let's check if we can fit in another meeting. After Paul, we have time until 20:30, but Rebecca is already met. So, perhaps that's all.\n\nBut wait, let's see: after Paul ends at 19:30, can we go to Mission District again? No, because Rebecca was already met. Or perhaps go somewhere else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Rebecca, we can go to another location, but I think all friends are already met.\n\nWait, let's count the friends met:\n\nJoseph, Carol, Matthew, Charles, Joshua, Jeffrey, Rebecca, Paul. That's 8 out of 9, excluding Elizabeth.\n\nWait, but the initial list had 9 friends, but Elizabeth couldn't be met. So, 8 is the maximum possible.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's a way to meet all 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can adjust the order to fit in more meetings or avoid waiting.\n\nAnother approach: after meeting Jeffrey at 17:22, instead of going to Rebecca at 17:35, perhaps go to someone else.\n\nWait, but Rebecca is available from 17:00, so 17:35 is within her time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after Jeffrey, go to Matthew if not already met. But in this case, Matthew was met earlier.\n\nWait, no, in the current plan, Matthew is met at 11:23.\n\nSo, perhaps the current plan is optimal.\n\nWait, but let's make sure that each meeting's end time plus travel time to the next location doesn't exceed the next meeting's start time.\n\nFor example, after Joseph ends at 10:15, we travel to Financial District, arriving at 10:20. Then wait until 10:45 to meet Carol.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother point: when traveling from Golden Gate Park to Union Square, we arrive at 12:30, which is within Charles's available time.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, after Charles ends at 14:30, travel to Embarcadero, arriving at 14:41, which is within Joshua's available time.\n\nYes.\n\nAfter Joshua ends at 15:46, travel to Bayview, arriving at 16:07, within Jeffrey's time.\n\nYes.\n\nAfter Jeffrey ends at 17:22, travel to Mission District, arriving at 17:35, which is within Rebecca's time.\n\nYes.\n\nAfter Rebecca ends at 18:20, travel to Haight-Ashbury, arriving at 18:32. Wait until 19:15 to meet Paul.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this seems feasible.\n\nNow, let's check if all the meeting durations are met:\n\n- Joseph: 60 mins (9:15-10:15)\n- Carol:15 mins (10:45-11:00)\n- Matthew:45 mins (11:23-12:08)\n- Charles:120 mins (12:30-14:30)\n- Joshua:105 mins (14:41-15:46)\n- Jeffrey:75 mins (16:07-17:22)\n- Rebecca:45 mins (17:35-18:20)\n- Paul:15 mins (19:15-19:30)\n\nAll durations are satisfied.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps I need to take in the code:\n\n1. Create a data structure for travel times. Maybe a dictionary with keys as tuples (from_location, to_location) and values as minutes.\n\n2. Create a list of friends with their location, available start and end times, and required duration.\n\n3. Convert all times to minutes since midnight for easier calculations. For example, 9:00 is 540 minutes.\n\n4. Find an order of meetings that fits as many as possible without overlapping, considering travel times.\n\nBut how to implement this? It's a bit complex.\n\nPerhaps a backtracking approach where we try all possible orders, but that's computationally intensive. Alternatively, use a heuristic approach, like greedy, to select the next best meeting.\n\nBut for the sake of this problem, perhaps the optimal solution can be constructed manually as above, but the code needs to compute it.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the program must compute the schedule, not just print a pre-determined answer. So, I can't hardcode the solution.\n\nTherefore, I need to implement an algorithm that can find the optimal schedule.\n\nOne approach is to generate all possible permutations of the friends and for each permutation, check if it's possible to schedule all meetings in that order without conflicts. Then, select the permutation with the maximum number of meetings, and if there's a tie, the one with the earliest end time or something.\n\nBut with 8 friends, 8! is 40320 permutations, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each friend, try to add them to the schedule in all possible orders, keeping track of the current time and location.\n\nBut I think the permutation approach is feasible here.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate all possible permutations of the friends (excluding Elizabeth, as she can't be met).\n\n- For each permutation, try to schedule the meetings in order:\n\n   a. Start at Marina at 9:00.\n\n   b. For each friend in the permutation:\n\n      i. Calculate the travel time from current location to friend's location.\n\n      ii. Check if arrival time is within the friend's available window.\n\n      iii. If yes, schedule the meeting, update current location and time.\n\n      iv. If no, skip this permutation.\n\n- Keep track of the permutation that allows the most meetings.\n\n- Among those with the maximum count, choose the one that finishes earliest or has the highest total time.\n\nBut wait, the goal is to meet as many friends as possible. So, the permutation that includes the most friends is the best.\n\nSo, in code, I can:\n\n- Iterate over all possible subsets of friends, ordered in all possible ways.\n\n- For each subset, check if the meetings can be scheduled in that order.\n\nBut that's too time-consuming, as the number of subsets is 2^9=512, and for each subset, the number of permutations is factorial of the subset size.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a branch and bound approach, but that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a priority-based approach, selecting the next friend based on certain criteria, like earliest end time, or shortest travel time, etc.\n\nBut I'm not sure which heuristic would work best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps model this as a graph where each node represents a state (current location, current time), and edges represent adding a meeting. Then, perform a BFS to find the path that visits the most nodes (meetings).\n\nBut this could be memory-intensive.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the permutation approach is manageable, especially since the number of friends is small (8 after excluding Elizabeth).\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nIn code:\n\n- Read the travel times into a dictionary.\n\n- For each friend, create a dictionary with their details.\n\n- Generate all possible permutations of the friends (excluding Elizabeth).\n\n- For each permutation:\n\n   - Initialize current_time = 9:00 (540 mins), current_location = 'Marina District'.\n\n   - meetings = []\n\n   - for friend in permutation:\n\n      - travel_time = travel_times[(current_location, friend['location'])]\n\n      - arrival_time = current_time + travel_time\n\n      - friend_start = max(arrival_time, friend['start_time'])\n\n      - friend_end = friend_start + friend['duration']\n\n      - if friend_end > friend['end_time']: skip this permutation.\n\n      - else:\n\n         - add to meetings.\n\n         - current_time = friend_end\n\n         - current_location = friend['location']\n\n   - if number of meetings in this permutation is greater than the current maximum, update.\n\n- After all permutations, output the itinerary with the maximum meetings.\n\nBut wait, in this approach, the order of the permutation dictates the order of meetings. So, the code will find the permutation that allows the most meetings.\n\nBut with 8 friends, 8! is 40320 permutations. For each permutation, we have to loop through 8 friends, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize by breaking early if a permutation can't meet all friends.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nFirst, the travel times. The user provided a list of travel times, but it's a bit tedious to input them all. But for the code, I'll have to create a dictionary.\n\nSimilarly, the friends' data needs to be represented with their location, start and end times in minutes, and duration.\n\nSo, first, I'll parse the constraints into a list of friends.\n\nLet me list them again, excluding Elizabeth:\n\nFriends:\n\n1. Joshua:\n   - location: Embarcadero\n   - start: 9:45 (570 mins)\n   - end: 18:00 (1080 mins)\n   - duration: 105\n\n2. Jeffrey:\n   - location: Bayview\n   - start: 9:45 (570)\n   - end: 20:15 (1215)\n   - duration:75\n\n3. Charles:\n   - location: Union Square\n   - start:10:45 (645)\n   - end:20:15 (1215)\n   - duration:120\n\n4. Joseph:\n   - location: Chinatown\n   - start:7:00 (420)\n   - end:15:30 (930)\n   - duration:60\n\n5. Matthew:\n   - location: Golden Gate Park\n   - start:11:00 (660)\n   - end:19:30 (1170)\n   - duration:45\n\n6. Carol:\n   - location: Financial District\n   - start:10:45 (645)\n   - end:11:15 (675)\n   - duration:15\n\n7. Paul:\n   - location: Haight-Ashbury\n   - start:19:15 (1155)\n   - end:20:30 (1230)\n   - duration:15\n\n8. Rebecca:\n   - location: Mission District\n   - start:17:00 (1020)\n   - end:21:45 (1305)\n   - duration:45\n\nSo, I'll create a list of these friends.\n\nNext, the travel times. The user provided a long list, so I'll have to create a dictionary with all the from-to pairs.\n\nBut that's a lot of data entry. I'll have to be careful.\n\nOnce that's done, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\n1. Read travel times into a dictionary.\n\n2. Create the friends list as above.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the friends.\n\n4. For each permutation:\n\n   a. Initialize current_time = 540 (9:00), current_location = 'Marina District'\n\n   b. itinerary = []\n\n   c. for friend in permutation:\n\n      i. Calculate travel_time from current_location to friend['location']\n\n      ii. arrival_time = current_time + travel_time\n\n      iii. If arrival_time > friend['end_time']: break, can't meet.\n\n      iv. Else, calculate the start_time as max(arrival_time, friend['start_time'])\n\n      v. If start_time + duration > friend['end_time']: break.\n\n      vi. Else, add to itinerary.\n\n      vii. Update current_time and current_location.\n\n   d. If the number of meetings in itinerary is greater than the current maximum, update.\n\n5. After all permutations, output the itinerary with the maximum meetings.\n\nBut wait, the code needs to find the optimal schedule, which may not be the first permutation that meets the maximum. So, it's better to track the best schedule found so far.\n\nNow, in Python, the itertools.permutations function can generate all possible permutations.\n\nBut with 8 friends, 8! is 40320, which is manageable.\n\nBut in the example I thought of earlier, the optimal schedule had 8 meetings. So, the code should find that.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, not all 8 can be met, but the code will find the maximum possible.\n\nNow, let's think about possible issues.\n\nOne issue is that the code may not find the optimal schedule because it's trying permutations in a certain order, but perhaps a different permutation allows more meetings. But since we're checking all permutations, it should find the one with the maximum.\n\nAnother issue is that the code may take a long time to run, but for 40320 permutations, each with 8 steps, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nBut wait, in the friends list, I have 8 friends. So, the permutations will be of length 8.\n\nBut in the earlier plan, the code may not find that exact order because it's trying all possible orders.\n\nBut perhaps the code will find a permutation that allows all 8 meetings.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, the travel times.\n\nI'll create a dictionary called travel_times where the key is a tuple (from_location, to_location), and the value is the time in minutes.\n\nThen, the friends list.\n\nThen, generate permutations.\n\nFor each permutation, simulate the schedule.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut wait, the friends have different names and locations. So, I'll have to represent each friend as a dictionary with 'name', 'location', 'start', 'end', 'duration'.\n\nSo, let's define the friends list.\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Joshua',\n        'location': 'Embarcadero',\n        'start': 570,  # 9:45\n        'end': 1080,   # 18:00\n        'duration': 105\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Jeffrey',\n        'location': 'Bayview',\n        'start': 570,\n        'end': 1215,\n        'duration':75\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Charles',\n        'location': 'Union Square',\n        'start': 645,\n        'end': 1215,\n        'duration':120\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Joseph',\n        'location': 'Chinatown',\n        'start': 420,\n        'end': 930,\n        'duration':60\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Matthew',\n        'location': 'Golden Gate Park',\n        'start': 660,\n        'end': 1170,\n        'duration':45\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Carol',\n        'location': 'Financial District',\n        'start': 645,\n        'end': 675,\n        'duration':15\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Paul',\n        'location': 'Haight-Ashbury',\n        'start': 1155,\n        'end': 1230,\n        'duration':15\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Rebecca',\n        'location': 'Mission District',\n        'start': 1020,\n        'end': 1305,\n        'duration':45\n    }\n]\n\nWait, but I think I missed one friend. Let me recount.\n\nThe original list after excluding Elizabeth has 8 friends, as listed above.\n\nNow, the travel times. I'll have to input all the provided data.\n\nBut that's a lot of data. Let me think about the structure.\n\nFor example, the first line is Marina District to Embarcadero:14.\n\nSo, the key is ('Marina District', 'Embarcadero'), value is 14.\n\nSimilarly for all other lines.\n\nSo, the code will have a big dictionary with all these entries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a function to parse the input, but since the input is given as a block, I'll have to manually enter each into the dictionary.\n\nThis will take a lot of code lines, but it's necessary.\n\nOnce the travel_times dictionary is built, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImport necessary modules: itertools for permutations.\n\nRead the travel times into the dictionary.\n\nDefine the friends list.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the friends.\n\nFor each permutation, simulate the schedule.\n\nTrack the best schedule.\n\nFinally, output the best schedule as JSON.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut wait, the code needs to handle the permutations correctly.\n\nIn code:\n\nimport itertools\n\ntravel_times = {\n    #

However, in the itinerary, the times are being stored as f-strings with leading zeros for hours and minutes. But the problem statement says that times should be in 24-hour format without leading zeros, like '9:00' or '13:30'.\n\nSo, the code needs to format the times correctly.\n\nSo, in the code, when creating the itinerary, the start_time and end_time should be formatted without leading zeros.\n\nSo, instead of f\"{start_time // 60:02d}:{start_time % 60:02d}\", it should be f\"{start_time // 60}:{start_time % 60:02d}\".\n\nBut wait, in Python, using :02d for minutes is correct because minutes should be two digits, but hours should not have leading zeros.\n\nSo, the code should format hours as integers without leading zeros, and minutes as two digits.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\nstart_hour = start_time // 60\nstart_minute = start_time % 60\nstart_time_str = f\"{start_hour}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n\nSimilarly for end_time.\n\nSo, in the code, the itinerary is built with:\n\nitinerary.append({\n    'action': 'meet',\n    'location': friend['location'],\n    'person': friend['name'],\n    'start_time': f\"{start_hour}:{start_minute:02d}\",\n    'end_time': f\"{end_hour}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n})\n\nSo, the code needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nLet me correct that part.\n\nIn the code:\n\nfor friend in perm:\n    # Calculate travel time\n    travel = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n    if travel is None:\n        # No travel time available, skip\n        break\n    \n    arrival_time = current_time + travel\n    if arrival_time > friend['end']:\n        break\n    \n    # Determine start time\n    start_time = max(arrival_time, friend['start'])\n    end_time = start_time + friend['duration']\n    \n    if end_time > friend['end']:\n        break\n    \n    # Format times\n    start_hour = start_time // 60\n    start_minute = start_time % 60\n    end_hour = end_time // 60\n    end_minute = end_time % 60\n    \n    itinerary.append({\n        'action': 'meet',\n        'location': friend['location'],\n        'person': friend['name'],\n        'start_time': f\"{start_hour}:{start_minute:02d}\",\n        'end_time': f\"{end_hour}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n    })\n    \n    current_time = end_time\n    current_location = friend['location']\n\nYes, this should format the times correctly.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nBut wait, in the friends list, I have 8 friends, so permutations of 8 elements. The code will generate all possible 8! permutations and check each.\n\nBut in the example I thought of earlier, the code would find a permutation that allows all 8 meetings.\n\nHowever, due to the computational time, perhaps the code may take a while to run, but for the problem's sake, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code is complete.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal meeting schedule for a day in San Francisco, considering various constraints such as travel times between locations and the availability of each friend. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible within their specified time windows.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at Marina District at 9:00 AM and need to visit different friends at their respective locations. Each friend has a specific time window and a minimum meeting duration. Travel times between locations are provided, which must be considered when planning the schedule.\n\n2. **Data Structures**: \n   - A dictionary to store travel times between locations.\n   - A list of dictionaries to store each friend's details, including their location, available start and end times, and required meeting duration.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a permutation-based approach to generate all possible orders of meeting friends. For each permutation, we simulate the schedule to check if it is feasible considering travel times and time windows. The permutation that allows the maximum number of meetings is selected as the optimal schedule.\n\n4. **Complexity Consideration**: Given the small number of friends (8 after excluding one due to constraints), generating all permutations (8! = 40320) is computationally feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Travel times in minutes between locations\ntravel_times = {\n

availability and meeting duration.\n\n2. **Permutations Generation**: Using `itertools.permutations`, the code generates all possible orders of meeting the friends.\n\n3. **Schedule Simulation**: For each permutation, the code simulates the schedule by calculating travel times, checking availability, and ensuring meetings fit within the specified time windows.\n\n4. **Optimal Schedule Selection**: The permutation that allows the maximum number of meetings is selected as the optimal schedule.\n\n5. **Result Formatting**: The optimal schedule is formatted into a JSON structure and printed as the final result.\n\nThis approach ensures that the optimal meeting schedule is computed efficiently, considering all constraints and maximizing the number of meetings.",
