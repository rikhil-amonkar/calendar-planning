            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to write a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule based on the given constraints. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem. The user arrives at Bayview at 9:00 AM and wants to meet as many friends as possible. Each friend has specific time windows and locations where they're available, and each meeting requires a minimum duration. The goal is to find a schedule that allows the user to meet all possible friends without overlapping times and considering travel durations between locations.\n\nLet me list out the friends and their constraints:\n\n- Barbara is at North Beach from 13:45 to 20:15. Needs at least 60 minutes.\n- Margaret is at Presidio from 10:15 to 15:15. Needs at least 30 minutes.\n- Kevin is at Haight-Ashbury from 20:00 to 20:45. Needs 30 minutes.\n- Kimberly is at Union Square from 7:45 to 16:45. Needs 30 minutes.\n\nThe user starts at Bayview at 9:00. So, the first thing is to figure out the order in which to meet these friends, considering travel times and their availability.\n\nI think the approach should involve generating possible schedules and selecting the one that meets the most friends. Since there are four friends, but the time constraints might make it impossible to meet all, I need to prioritize based on who can be met without missing others.\n\nLet me consider the possible sequences. Maybe starting with Kimberly since she's available early, but the user is at Bayview. The travel time from Bayview to Union Square is 17 minutes. So arriving at 9:17. But Kimberly is available from 7:45, so that's okay. They can meet for 30 minutes, ending at 9:47.\n\nThen, from Union Square, where to next? Let's see the other friends' availability.\n\nMargaret is at Presidio until 15:15. The travel time from Union Square to Presidio is 22 minutes. So arriving at 9:47 + 22 = 10:09. Margaret is available from 10:15, so we can start at 10:15. Meeting for 30 minutes ends at 10:45.\n\nNext, from Presidio, perhaps head to North Beach for Barbara. Travel time from Presidio to North Beach is 18 minutes. So arrive at 10:45 + 18 = 11:03. Barbara is available from 13:45, so we can't meet her until then. So maybe we can do other things in between.\n\nAlternatively, after Margaret, maybe go to Haight-Ashbury for Kevin, but Kevin is only available at 20:00, which is later. So perhaps it's better to go to North Beach earlier.\n\nWait, but Barbara is only available from 13:45. So after meeting Margaret, the user could go to North Beach, but they can't meet Barbara until 13:45. So they could arrive at North Beach at 11:03, but have to wait until 13:45. That's a long wait, but maybe it's worth it to meet Barbara.\n\nAlternatively, after Margaret, maybe go back to Bayview or another location, but that might not be efficient.\n\nWait, another option: after meeting Kimberly at Union Square, maybe go to Haight-Ashbury. The travel time from Union Square to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So arriving at 9:47 + 18 = 10:05. But Kevin is only available from 20:00, so that's too early. So perhaps that's not useful.\n\nAlternatively, after Kimberly, go to Presidio as before. Then, from Presidio to North Beach, arriving at 11:03. Then wait until 13:45 to meet Barbara. That would take a lot of time, but maybe it's the only way.\n\nSo, the schedule so far could be:\n\n- 9:00-9:17: Travel to Union Square.\n- 9:17-9:47: Meet Kimberly.\n- 9:47-10:09: Travel to Presidio.\n- 10:15-10:45: Meet Margaret.\n- 10:45-11:03: Travel to North Beach.\n- 13:45-14:45: Meet Barbara.\n\nThen, after Barbara, can we meet Kevin? Barbara's meeting ends at 14:45. Travel from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes, arriving at 15:03. But Kevin is only available from 20:00, so we can't meet him then. So perhaps after Barbara, we can go to Haight-Ashbury and wait, but that's a long wait until 20:00. Alternatively, maybe after Barbara, go back to Bayview or somewhere else, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Margaret, instead of going to North Beach, go to Haight-Ashbury, but again, Kevin isn't available until 20:00. So perhaps the only way is to meet Barbara, then wait until Kevin's time.\n\nBut that would require a lot of waiting time, which might not be optimal. Alternatively, perhaps after Barbara, go to Haight-Ashbury and arrive at 14:45 + travel time. Let's calculate:\n\nFrom North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So arrival at 14:45 + 0:18 = 15:03. Kevin is available from 20:00, so we can't meet him until then. So we have from 15:03 to 20:00 free, which is 4h57m. That's a lot of waiting. But if we can meet Kevin, it's worth it.\n\nSo after Barbara, we could stay in North Beach until 13:45, then go to Haight-Ashbury, arriving at 15:03, then wait until 20:00 to meet Kevin for 30 minutes. So Kevin's meeting would be 20:00-20:30.\n\nSo the schedule would be:\n\n1. 9:00-9:17: Travel to Union Square.\n2. 9:17-9:47: Meet Kimberly.\n3. 9:47-10:09: Travel to Presidio.\n4. 10:15-10:45: Meet Margaret.\n5. 10:45-11:03: Travel to North Beach.\n6. 13:45-14:45: Meet Barbara.\n7. 14:45-15:03: Travel to Haight-Ashbury.\n8. 20:00-20:30: Meet Kevin.\n\nBut wait, after arriving at Haight-Ashbury at 15:03, we have to wait until 20:00. That's a long time, but it's necessary to meet Kevin. So this schedule allows meeting all four friends.\n\nBut let's check the travel times again. Let me re-calculate each step.\n\n- Start at Bayview at 9:00.\n- Travel to Union Square: 17 minutes. Arrive at 9:17.\n- Meet Kimberly until 9:47.\n- Travel to Presidio: 22 minutes. 9:47 + 0:22 = 10:09. But Margaret starts at 10:15, so we can start then.\n- Meet Margaret until 10:45.\n- Travel to North Beach: 18 minutes. 10:45 + 0:18 = 11:03.\n- Wait until 13:45 to meet Barbara. So from 11:03 to 13:45 is 2h42m. That's a long wait, but necessary.\n- Meet Barbara until 14:45.\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury: 18 minutes. Arrive at 15:03.\n- Wait until 20:00. That's 4h57m.\n- Meet Kevin until 20:30.\n\nSo this schedule meets all four friends. But is this the optimal way? Are there any overlaps or time constraints I'm missing?\n\nWait, what about the time between 11:03 and 13:45? That's a lot of idle time. Maybe during that time, the user could go somewhere else, but considering that Barbara is only available from 13:45, it's necessary to be at North Beach by then.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user could go to another location during that wait, but that might complicate things. For example, maybe go back to Bayview or somewhere else, but that would require more travel time and might not allow meeting someone else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Margaret, instead of going to North Beach, go to Haight-Ashbury, but Kevin isn't available until 20:00, so that might not help. Or go to Union Square again, but Kimberly is already met.\n\nHmm. So the initial plan seems possible, but let's see if there's a better way.\n\nAnother approach: maybe meet Margaret first, then Kimberly, then Barbara, then Kevin.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- Start at Bayview at 9:00.\n- Travel to Presidio: 31 minutes. Arrive at 9:31. But Margaret starts at 10:15, so wait until then.\n- Meet Margaret until 10:45.\n- Travel to Union Square: 22 minutes. Arrive at 11:07. Meet Kimberly until 11:37.\n- Then, travel to North Beach: from Union Square, it's 7 minutes. Arrive at 11:44. Wait until 13:45 to meet Barbara. So 11:44 to 13:45 is 2h01m wait.\n- Meet Barbara until 14:45.\n- Then, travel to Haight-Ashbury: 18 minutes. Arrive at 15:03. Wait until 20:00. Meet Kevin until 20:30.\n\nThis way, the user meets Margaret, Kimberly, Barbara, and Kevin. So same number of friends, but the order is different. The total time spent waiting is similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Kimberly first, then Margaret, then Barbara, then Kevin, as in the first plan.\n\nAnother consideration: the user can only be in one place at a time, so overlapping meetings are impossible.\n\nWait, another thought: after meeting Barbara, perhaps instead of going to Haight-Ashbury, go to Union Square again, but Kimberly is already met. Or maybe go to Presidio, but Margaret is already met.\n\nSo, the initial plan seems to be the way to meet all four friends.\n\nWait, but in the initial plan, after meeting Barbara, the user goes to Haight-Ashbury, arrives at 15:03, and waits until 20:00. That's a long wait, but necessary to meet Kevin.\n\nSo, the schedule would include all four meetings.\n\nBut wait, let me check the travel times again to make sure.\n\nFrom Bayview to Union Square: 17 minutes.\n\nUnion Square to Presidio: 22 minutes.\n\nPresidio to North Beach: 18 minutes.\n\nNorth Beach to Haight-Ashbury: 18 minutes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nI need to represent each friend's availability and location. Then, calculate possible itineraries, considering the order of meetings, travel times, and availability.\n\nBut since the problem is small, perhaps a brute-force approach considering all permutations of friends and checking if a valid schedule exists for each permutation.\n\nBut with four friends, there are 4! = 24 permutations. For each permutation, check if it's possible to meet all friends in that order without overlapping times.\n\nWait, but some permutations might not be possible due to time constraints.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible permutations of the four friends.\n2. For each permutation, calculate the schedule, considering travel times and availability.\n3. Check if all meetings can be accommodated without overlap and within each person's available time.\n4. Among all valid permutations, select the one that meets the most friends. If multiple permutations meet the same number, choose the one that meets them earliest or in some optimal order.\n\nBut since the goal is to meet as many as possible, perhaps the optimal solution meets all four, but if not, then three, etc.\n\nIn our case, the initial plan seems to meet all four, so that's the best.\n\nSo, in the code, I can represent each friend as a dictionary with their name, location, start time, end time, and required duration.\n\nThen, for each permutation of friends, attempt to create a schedule, adding each meeting in order, considering travel from the previous location.\n\nIf at any point a meeting can't be scheduled (either because the required duration can't be met within the available time or because arrival is after the person's end time), then this permutation is invalid.\n\nOtherwise, if all meetings are scheduled successfully, then this is a valid itinerary.\n\nOnce all permutations are checked, select the one with the most meetings. If multiple, perhaps the one that finishes earliest or starts earliest.\n\nBut since the user wants to meet as many as possible, the first valid permutation that includes all four would be the solution.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps in code:\n\n- Define the friends with their constraints.\n- Generate all permutations of the friends.\n- For each permutation, initialize the current time and location.\n- For each friend in the permutation:\n   - Calculate the earliest arrival time at their location.\n   - Check if there's enough time within their availability to meet for the required duration.\n   - If yes, add the meeting to the itinerary and update current time and location.\n   - If no, break and try the next permutation.\n- Keep track of the best itinerary (the one with the most meetings).\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nEach friend can be a dictionary:\n\nfriends = [\n    {'name': 'Barbara', 'location': 'North Beach', 'start': '13:45', 'end': '20:15', 'duration': 60},\n    {'name': 'Margaret', 'location': 'Presidio', 'start': '10:15', 'end': '15:15', 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Kevin', 'location': 'Haight-Ashbury', 'start': '20:00', 'end': '20:45', 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Kimberly', 'location': 'Union Square', 'start': '7:45', 'end': '16:45', 'duration': 30},\n]\n\nWait, but Kimberly's start is 7:45, which is before the user arrives at Bayview at 9:00. So the user can't meet her before 9:00.\n\nSo, in the code, when considering Kimberly, the earliest possible meeting start is 9:00 plus travel time.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle that.\n\nNow, for each permutation, the code will attempt to schedule each meeting in order.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate the arrival time and check availability.\n\nFor each friend in the permutation:\n\n1. Calculate the travel time from the current location to the friend's location.\n2. Add this to the current end time to get the arrival time.\n3. Convert the friend's start and end times to minutes since midnight for easier calculations.\n4. The meeting must start no earlier than the friend's start time and end no later than the friend's end time.\n5. The meeting must be at least the required duration.\n6. So, the earliest possible start time is the maximum of (arrival time, friend's start time).\n7. The latest possible end time is the friend's end time.\n8. If earliest start + duration > latest end, then can't meet this friend in this permutation.\n9. Otherwise, schedule the meeting from earliest start to earliest start + duration, and update current location and time.\n\nSo, the code will need functions to convert time strings to minutes and back.\n\nFor example, '9:00' becomes 540 minutes (9*60), '13:45' is 825, etc.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, I'll write a helper function to convert time strings to minutes.\n\ndef time_to_minutes(t):\n    h, m = map(int, t.split(':'))\n    return h * 60 + m\n\nSimilarly, a function to convert minutes back to time string.\n\ndef minutes_to_time(m):\n    h = m // 60\n    m = m % 60\n    return f\"{h}:{m:02d}\"\n\nWait, but the output requires times without leading zero, like '9:00' instead of '09:00'. So, the function should return 'H:MM' where H is without leading zero.\n\nSo, adjust the function:\n\ndef minutes_to_time(m):\n    h = m // 60\n    m = m % 60\n    return f\"{h}:{m:02d}\"\n\nWait, but for h=9, it will be '9:00', which is correct.\n\nNow, for each permutation, I'll simulate the schedule.\n\nLet's outline the steps in code.\n\nImport necessary modules:\n\nimport itertools\n\nDefine the friends:\n\nfriends = [\n    {'name': 'Barbara', 'location': 'North Beach', 'start': '13:45', 'end': '20:15', 'duration': 60},\n    {'name': 'Margaret', 'location': 'Presidio', 'start': '10:15', 'end': '15:15', 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Kevin', 'location': 'Haight-Ashbury', 'start': '20:00', 'end': '20:45', 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Kimberly', 'location': 'Union Square', 'start': '7:45', 'end': '16:45', 'duration': 30},\n]\n\nDefine the travel times as a dictionary, perhaps as a nested dictionary.\n\ntravel_times = {\n    'Bayview': {\n        'North Beach': 21,\n        'Presidio': 31,\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 19,\n        'Union Square': 17,\n    },\n    'North Beach': {\n        'Bayview': 22,\n        'Presidio': 17,\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 18,\n        'Union Square': 7,\n    },\n    'Presidio': {\n        'Bayview': 31,\n        'North Beach': 18,\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 15,\n        'Union Square': 22,\n    },\n    'Haight-Ashbury': {\n        'Bayview': 18,\n        'North Beach': 19,\n        'Presidio': 15,\n        'Union Square': 17,\n    },\n    'Union Square': {\n        'Bayview': 15,\n        'North Beach': 10,\n        'Presidio': 24,\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 18,\n    },\n}\n\nWait, but in the input, the travel times are given in both directions, so I need to make sure the keys are correctly set. For example, 'Bayview to North Beach' is 21, so in the dictionary, it's under 'Bayview' as key, 'North Beach' as subkey, value 21.\n\nYes, as I've written above.\n\nNow, the initial location is 'Bayview' at 9:00 (540 minutes).\n\nFor each permutation of the friends, attempt to create a schedule.\n\nInitialize the best_itinerary as empty.\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_location = 'Bayview'\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n    itinerary = []\n    valid = True\n    for friend in perm:\n        # Calculate travel time from current_location to friend's location\n        travel = travel_times[current_location][friend['location']]\n        arrival = current_time + travel\n        # Convert friend's start and end times to minutes\n        start = time_to_minutes(friend['start'])\n        end = time_to_minutes(friend['end'])\n        # The earliest we can start is the maximum of arrival and start\n        meet_start = max(arrival, start)\n        # The meeting needs to end by the earliest of (meet_start + duration) and end\n        meet_end = meet_start + friend['duration']\n        if meet_end > end:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        # Add to itinerary\n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': minutes_to_time(meet_start),\n            'end_time': minutes_to_time(meet_end)\n        })\n        # Update current location and time\n        current_location = friend['location']\n        current_time = meet_end\n    if valid:\n        # Check if this itinerary is better than the current best\n        # If it's the first valid, or it has more meetings, update\n        if len(itinerary) > len(best_itinerary):\n            best_itinerary = itinerary.copy()\n\nWait, but in the code above, perm is a tuple of the friend dictionaries. So, for each friend in the permutation, we process them in order.\n\nBut wait, the code as written will process each permutation, and if the permutation is valid (all friends can be met in order), then the itinerary is considered. The best itinerary is the one with the most meetings.\n\nBut in our case, the permutation that includes all four friends will be the best.\n\nBut what if a permutation can't meet all four? Then, the code will process the next permutation.\n\nOnce all permutations are processed, the best_itinerary will have the maximum number of meetings possible.\n\nBut let's test this logic.\n\nIn the initial permutation, the order is Barbara, Margaret, Kevin, Kimberly. Let's see:\n\n- Start at Bayview, 9:00.\n\nFirst, Barbara is at North Beach. Travel time from Bayview to North Beach is 21. So arrival at 9:21.\n\nBarbara is available from 13:45. So meet_start is max(9:21, 13:45) = 13:45. Meet for 60 minutes until 14:45.\n\nThen, next is Margaret at Presidio. Travel from North Beach to Presidio is 17. So arrival at 14:45 + 17 = 15:02. Margaret is available until 15:15. So meet_start is 15:02, but her end is 15:15. The required duration is 30, so 15:02 +30 =15:32 >15:15. So can't meet Margaret. So this permutation is invalid.\n\nThus, this permutation is invalid, so the code moves on.\n\nAnother permutation: Kimberly, Margaret, Barbara, Kevin.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart at Bayview, 9:00.\n\nFirst, Kimberly at Union Square. Travel time 17. Arrival at 9:17. Kimberly's start is 7:45, so meet_start is 9:17. Meet for 30 minutes until 9:47.\n\nNext, Margaret at Presidio. Travel from Union Square to Presidio is 22. Arrival at 9:47 +22=10:09. Margaret starts at 10:15, so meet_start is 10:15. Meet for 30 until 10:45.\n\nNext, Barbara at North Beach. Travel from Presidio to North Beach is 18. Arrival at 10:45 +18=11:03. Barbara is available from 13:45. So meet_start is 13:45. Meet for 60 until 14:45.\n\nNext, Kevin at Haight-Ashbury. Travel from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18. Arrival at 14:45 +18=15:03. Kevin is available from 20:00. So meet_start is 20:00. Meet for 30 until 20:30.\n\nSo this permutation is valid and includes all four friends. So the itinerary will have four entries.\n\nThus, the code should find this permutation as a valid one, and since it's the first permutation that includes all four, it will be the best.\n\nSo, the code will output this itinerary.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the best_itinerary is initialized as empty. Then, for each permutation, if valid and the length is greater than the current best, it updates.\n\nSo, in this case, the code will find a permutation that includes all four and set best_itinerary to that.\n\nNow, the code will generate the correct JSON output.\n\nBut wait, the code as written in the pseudo-code above doesn't account for the fact that after meeting Barbara, the arrival at Haight-Ashbury is 15:03, but Kevin is only available from 20:00. So the code correctly sets meet_start to 20:00, and meet_end to 20:30.\n\nYes, because:\n\narrival = current_time (14:45) + travel (18) = 15:03 (15*60+3=903 minutes)\nfriend's start is 20:00 (1200), end is 20:45 (1245).\n\nmeet_start = max(903, 1200) = 1200\nmeet_end = 1200 +30=1230 <1245, so valid.\n\nThus, the code will correctly schedule this.\n\nNow, the code will output the itinerary as a list of four meetings.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, I need to write this in Python, making sure to handle all the steps correctly.\n\nPotential issues to watch out for:\n\n- Correctly calculating travel times between locations.\n- Converting times correctly to and from minutes.\n- Handling cases where arrival time is after the friend's end time, making the meeting impossible.\n- Generating all permutations correctly.\n- Selecting the best itinerary with the most meetings.\n\nAnother thing: the user's starting point is Bayview at 9:00. So, for the first meeting, the travel time is added to 9:00.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nI'll structure it as follows:\n\n1. Import itertools.\n2. Define the friends and travel times.\n3. Define helper functions for time conversion.\n4. Initialize best_itinerary as empty.\n5. Iterate over all permutations of friends.\n6. For each permutation, simulate the schedule.\n7. If the permutation is valid (all meetings fit), update best_itinerary if it's better.\n8. After all permutations, output the best_itinerary as JSON.\n\nTesting the code with the example should produce the correct output.\n\nWait, but in the code, the friends are processed in the order of the permutation. So, the code will find the first permutation that meets all four and that's the best. But perhaps there are multiple permutations that meet all four, but the code will select the one with the earliest meetings or the first one found.\n\nBut since all permutations are considered, the code will find the best possible.\n\nNow, the code should be self-contained and output the JSON.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code will look like this:\n\nImport itertools.\n\nDefine friends and travel times.\n\nDefine time_to_minutes and minutes_to_time functions.\n\nIterate over all permutations.\n\nFor each permutation, simulate the meetings.\n\nKeep track of the best itinerary.\n\nFinally, print the JSON.\n\nNow, let me write the code.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef time_to_minutes(t):\n    h, m = map(int, t.split(':'))\n    return h * 60 + m\n\ndef minutes_to_time(m):\n    h = m // 60\n    m = m % 60\n    return f\"{h}:{m:02d}\"\n\ntravel_times = {\n    'Bayview': {\n        'North Beach': 21,\n        'Presidio': 31,\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 19,\n        'Union Square': 17,\n    },\n    'North Beach': {\n        'Bayview': 22,\n        'Presidio': 17,\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 18,\n        'Union Square': 7,\n    },\n    'Presidio': {\n        'Bayview': 31,\n        'North Beach': 18,\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 15,\n        'Union Square': 22,\n    },\n    'Haight-Ashbury': {\n        'Bayview': 18,\n        'North Beach': 19,\n        'Presidio': 15,\n        'Union Square': 17,\n    },\n    'Union Square': {\n        'Bayview': 15,\n        'North Beach': 10,\n        'Presidio': 24,\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 18,\n    },\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {'name': 'Barbara', 'location': 'North Beach', 'start': '13:45', 'end': '20:15', 'duration': 60},\n    {'name': 'Margaret', 'location': 'Presidio', 'start': '10:15', 'end': '15:15', 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Kevin', 'location': 'Haight-Ashbury', 'start': '20:00', 'end': '20:45', 'duration': 30},\n    {'name': 'Kimberly', 'location': 'Union Square', 'start': '7:45', 'end': '16:45', 'duration': 30},\n]\n\nbest_itinerary = []\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_location = 'Bayview'\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n    itinerary = []\n    valid = True\n    for friend in perm:\n        travel = travel_times[current_location][friend['location']]\n        arrival = current_time + travel\n        start = time_to_minutes(friend['start'])\n        end = time_to_minutes(friend['end'])\n        meet_start = max(arrival, start)\n        meet_end = meet_start + friend['duration']\n        if meet_end > end:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': minutes_to_time(meet_start),\n            'end_time': minutes_to_time(meet_end)\n        })\n        current_location = friend['location']\n        current_time = meet_end\n    if valid:\n        if len(itinerary) > len(best_itinerary):\n            best_itinerary = itinerary.copy()\n\nprint('SOLUTION:')\nprint('{ \"itinerary\": [')\nfor i, meeting in enumerate(best_itinerary):\n    print(f'    {{\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"{meeting[\"location\"]}\", \"person\": \"{meeting[\"person\"]}\", \"start_time\": \"{meeting[\"start_time\"]}\", \"end_time\": \"{meeting[\"end_time\"]}\"}}' + ('' if i == len(best_itinerary)-1 else ','))\nprint(']}')\n```",
