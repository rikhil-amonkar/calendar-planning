            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule for visiting friends in San Francisco. The program should consider various schedules and pick the best one based on the given constraints. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem. The user arrives at Union Square at 9:00 AM and wants to meet as many friends as possible. Each friend has a specific location, available time window, and a minimum meeting duration. The goal is to find the best schedule that allows meeting the maximum number of friends while respecting all constraints, including travel times between locations.\n\nI'll need to define the travel times between each pair of locations. The user provided a list of travel times in minutes, so I'll represent them in a dictionary for easy lookup. Each key will be a tuple of the starting and ending locations, and the value will be the travel time in minutes.\n\nNext, I'll define the friends' details. Each friend has a name, location, available start time, available end time, and the minimum duration required for the meeting. I'll store these details in a list of dictionaries.\n\nNow, I need to generate all possible permutations of the friends to consider every possible meeting order. For each permutation, I'll simulate the schedule to see if it's feasible. This involves calculating the travel time from the current location to the friend's location, checking if the meeting can fit within the friend's available time window, and ensuring the meeting duration is met.\n\nI'll use helper functions to convert time strings to minutes and vice versa. This will make it easier to perform time calculations. For example, converting \"9:00\" to 540 minutes (9 hours * 60 minutes) and converting 600 minutes back to \"10:00\".\n\nFor each permutation, I'll initialize the current time and location as Union Square at 9:00 AM. Then, for each friend in the permutation, I'll calculate the arrival time by adding the travel time from the current location to the friend's location. I'll check if the arrival time is within the friend's available window. If it is, I'll schedule the meeting, update the current time and location, and move to the next friend. If not, I'll mark this permutation as invalid and move to the next one.\n\nI'll keep track of the best itinerary, which is the one that allows meeting the most friends. After evaluating all permutations, I'll output the best itinerary in the specified JSON format.\n\nI should also handle cases where travel times are not available, which would make a permutation invalid. Additionally, I need to ensure that the meeting duration does not exceed the friend's available time window.\n\nFinally, I'll test the code to make sure it runs independently and produces valid JSON output. I'll also verify that the schedule respects all constraints, including travel times and meeting durations.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal meeting schedule for visiting friends in San Francisco, considering their availability constraints and travel times between locations. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, with each meeting lasting a specified minimum duration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Travel Times**: Represent travel times between different districts using a dictionary for quick lookup.\n2. **Define Friends' Availability**: Store each friend's details, including their name, location, availability window, and required meeting duration.\n3. **Generate Permutations**: Consider all possible orders of meeting friends to explore different schedules.\n4. **Simulate Each Permutation**: For each permutation, calculate travel times and check if each meeting fits within the friend's availability window.\n5. **Select the Best Schedule**: Track the permutation that allows meeting the most friends and output it in JSON format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + mins\n\ndef minutes_to_time(mins):\n    hours = mins // 60\n    mins = mins % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Union Square', 'Golden Gate Park'): 22,\n    ('Union Square', 'Pacific Heights'): 15,\n    ('Union Square', 'Presidio'): 24,\n    ('Union Square', 'Chinatown'): 7,\n    ('Union Square', 'The Castro'): 19,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Union Square'): 22,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Pacific Heights'): 16,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Presidio'): 11,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Chinatown'): 23,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'The Castro'): 13,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Union Square'): 12,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Golden Gate Park'): 15,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Presidio'): 11,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Chinatown'): 11,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'The Castro'): 16,\n    ('Presidio', 'Union Square'): 22,\n    ('Presidio', 'Golden Gate Park'): 12,\n    ('Presidio', 'Pacific Heights'): 11,\n    ('Presidio', 'Chinatown'): 21,\n    ('Presidio', 'The Castro'): 21,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Union Square'): 7,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Golden Gate Park'): 23,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Pacific Heights'): 10,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Presidio'): 19,\n    ('Chinatown', 'The Castro'): 22,\n    ('The Castro', 'Union Square'): 19,\n    ('The Castro', 'Golden Gate Park'): 11,\n    ('The Castro', 'Pacific Heights'): 16,\n    ('The Castro', 'Presidio'): 20,\n    ('The Castro', 'Chinatown'): 20\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Andrew',\n        'location': 'Golden Gate Park',\n        'available_start': '11:45',\n        'available_end': '14:30',\n        'required_duration': 75\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Sarah',\n        'location': 'Pacific Heights',\n        'available_start': '16:15',\n        'available_end': '18:45',\n        'required_duration': 15\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Nancy',\n        'location': 'Presidio',\n        'available_start': '17:30',\n        'available_end': '19:15',\n        'required_duration': 60\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Rebecca',\n        'location': 'Chinatown',\n        'available_start': '09:45',\n        'available_end': '21:30',\n        'required_duration': 90\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Robert',\n        'location': 'The Castro',\n        'available_start': '08:30',\n        'available_end': '14:15',\n        'required_duration': 30\n    }\n]\n\ncurrent_time = 540  #
