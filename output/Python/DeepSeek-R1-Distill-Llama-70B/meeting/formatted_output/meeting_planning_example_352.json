            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python program that calculates the optimal meeting schedule for someone visiting San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering their availability and the travel times between locations.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the input parameters. The user arrives at Union Square at 9:00 AM and wants to meet four friends located in different areas: Nob Hill, Haight-Ashbury, Chinatown, and Marina District. Each friend has specific time windows and meeting durations. The program needs to compute the best schedule, not just print a static answer.\n\nI'll need to structure the data. The travel times between locations are given, so I'll create a dictionary to store these times. Each location is a key, and the value is another dictionary mapping to the travel time to other locations.\n\nNext, I'll represent each friend with their details: name, location, start and end times, and the minimum meeting duration. This will help in checking if a meeting is feasible within their available time.\n\nThe core of the solution will involve generating all possible permutations of the friends. Since there are four friends, there will be 24 permutations. For each permutation, I'll simulate the schedule, starting from Union Square at 9:00 AM, and calculate the travel times and meeting times. I'll ensure that each meeting starts after the friend's available start time and ends before their available end time, including the travel duration.\n\nI'll need a helper function to convert minutes since midnight into a readable time format (HH:MM). This will make the output more user-friendly.\n\nFor each permutation, I'll initialize the current time and location, then iterate through each friend in the permutation. I'll calculate the arrival time at the friend's location, determine the meeting start and end times, and check if the meeting fits within the friend's availability. If it does, I'll add it to the itinerary and update the current time and location.\n\nI'll keep track of the best itinerary, which is the one with the maximum number of meetings. After evaluating all permutations, I'll output the best itinerary in the required JSON format.\n\nI should also handle cases where a meeting might not fit, so I'll skip those and move to the next friend in the permutation. This ensures that the program doesn't crash and continues to find the best possible schedule.\n\nFinally, I'll test the program with the given constraints to ensure it works correctly and outputs valid JSON. I'll make sure the code is self-contained and doesn't require any external libraries beyond what's necessary for JSON formatting.\n\nOverall, the approach is to use a brute-force method with permutations to explore all possible meeting orders, calculate the feasibility of each, and select the optimal one. This ensures that the solution is both comprehensive and efficient for the given problem constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport json\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Union Square', 'Nob Hill'): 9,\n    ('Union Square', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 18,\n    ('Union Square', 'Chinatown'): 7,\n    ('Union Square', 'Marina District'): 18,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Union Square'): 7,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 13,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Chinatown'): 6,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Marina District'): 11,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Union Square'): 17,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Nob Hill'): 15,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Chinatown'): 19,\n    ('Haight-Ashbury', 'Marina District'): 17,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Union Square'): 7,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Nob Hill'): 8,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 19,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Marina District'): 12,\n    ('Marina District', 'Union Square'): 16,\n    ('Marina District', 'Nob Hill'): 12,\n    ('Marina District', 'Haight-Ashbury'): 16,\n    ('Marina District', 'Chinatown'): 16,\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Karen',\n        'location': 'Nob Hill',\n        'start': 1350,  # 22:45 (9:15 PM)\n        'end': 1415,   # 23:45 (9:45 PM)\n        'duration': 30\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Joseph',\n        'location': 'Haight-Ashbury',\n        'start': 810,   # 13:30 (1:30 PM)\n        'end': 1365,   # 22:45 (10:45 PM)\n        'duration': 90\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Sandra',\n        'location': 'Chinatown',\n        'start': 435,   # 7:15 AM\n        'end': 1365,   # 22:45 (10:45 PM)\n        'duration': 75\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Nancy',\n        'location': 'Marina District',\n        'start': 660,   # 11:00 AM\n        'end': 1470,   # 24:00 (12:00 AM)\n        'duration': 105\n    }\n]\n\ndef minutes_to_time(m):\n    hours = m // 60\n    mins = m % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nbest_itinerary = []\nmax_meetings = 0\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n    current_location = 'Union Square'\n    itinerary = []\n    \n    for friend in perm:\n        travel = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n        if travel is None:\n            continue\n        \n        arrival = current_time + travel\n        meeting_start = max(arrival, friend['start'])\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n        \n        if meeting_end > friend['end']:\n            continue\n        \n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_start),\n            'end_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n        })\n        \n        current_time = meeting_end\n        current_location = friend['location']\n    \n    if len(itinerary) > max_meetings:\n        max_meetings = len(itinerary)\n        best_itinerary = itinerary\n\noutput = {\n    \"itinerary\": best_itinerary\n}\n\nprint(json.dumps(output))\n```",
