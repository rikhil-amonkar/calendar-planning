            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to plan an optimal meeting schedule for a day in San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering their availability and the travel times between locations. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem thoroughly. The user arrives at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. There are five friends to meet, each at different locations and with specific time windows. The meetings have minimum durations, and I need to ensure that the travel times between locations are accounted for.\n\nI think the first step is to list out all the friends with their details:\n\n1. Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM. Need to meet for at least 90 minutes.\n2. Jeffrey at Bayview from 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM. At least 60 minutes.\n3. Kevin at Mission District from 11:15 AM to 3:15 PM. At least 30 minutes.\n4. David at Embarcadero from 8:15 AM to 9:00 AM. At least 30 minutes.\n5. Barbara at Financial District from 10:30 AM to 4:30 PM. At least 15 minutes.\n\nThe user starts at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. So, the initial location is Golden Gate Park, and the start time is 9:00.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the order to meet these friends to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping times and ensuring that each meeting meets its minimum duration.\n\nI think I should prioritize meetings based on their time constraints. For example, David is only available until 9:00 AM, but the user arrives at 9:00, so maybe they can't meet him because by the time they arrive, David's window is closing. Alternatively, if they can leave immediately, perhaps they can meet him for a short time.\n\nWait, David is available from 8:15 AM to 9:00 AM. The user arrives at 9:00 AM, so the only possible time to meet David is exactly at 9:00 AM. But the meeting needs to be at least 30 minutes. So, if they start at 9:00, the earliest they can leave is 9:30. But David is only available until 9:00, so that's not possible. Therefore, it's impossible to meet David because by the time the user arrives, David's availability ends. So, David cannot be met.\n\nSo, I can eliminate David from the possible meetings.\n\nNow, the remaining friends are Joseph, Jeffrey, Kevin, and Barbara.\n\nNext, I should consider the order of meetings. Since the user starts at Golden Gate Park, the first meeting could be with someone whose location is closest or whose availability starts early.\n\nLooking at the friends:\n\n- Joseph is available all day, but his location is Fisherman's Wharf. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf is 24 minutes. So, if the user leaves at 9:00 AM, arrives at 9:24 AM. Joseph is available from 8:00 AM, so that's fine.\n\nBut Joseph needs a 90-minute meeting. So, if they start at 9:24, the meeting would end at 10:54 AM. Then, they can go to the next location.\n\nAlternatively, Barbara is available from 10:30 AM. Her location is Financial District, which is 26 minutes from Golden Gate Park. So, if the user goes to Barbara first, they would arrive at 9:26 AM, but Barbara isn't available until 10:30. So, the earliest they can meet is 10:30, but that would require waiting, which might not be efficient.\n\nKevin is at Mission District, available from 11:15 AM. The travel time from Golden Gate Park is 17 minutes, so arrival at 9:17 AM, but Kevin isn't available until 11:15. So, again, waiting time.\n\nJeffrey is at Bayview, available from 5:30 PM. So, that's later in the day.\n\nSo, perhaps the best first meeting is Joseph, as he's available all day, and the travel time is manageable.\n\nSo, first meeting: Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:24 AM to 11:00 AM (since 90 minutes is 1.5 hours, 9:24 + 1.5 = 10:54, but wait, 9:24 + 90 minutes is 10:54. So, the meeting would end at 10:54.\n\nWait, 9:24 + 1 hour is 10:24, plus 30 minutes is 10:54. So, the meeting ends at 10:54.\n\nAfter that, where to go next? The next available friend is Kevin at Mission District, starting at 11:15. So, from Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District: the travel time is 22 minutes. So, leaving Fisherman's Wharf at 10:54, arrives at 11:16. But Kevin is available from 11:15, so 11:16 is just after. The meeting needs to be at least 30 minutes, so from 11:16 to 11:46. But wait, 30 minutes is the minimum, so maybe we can adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can leave a bit earlier. Wait, the meeting with Joseph ends at 10:54. So, the user can leave immediately, taking 22 minutes to reach Mission District, arriving at 11:16. Then, meet Kevin from 11:16 to 11:46 (30 minutes). That works.\n\nAfter that, next is Barbara at Financial District. From Mission District to Financial District: the travel time is 17 minutes. So, leaving at 11:46, arrives at 12:03 PM. Barbara is available until 4:30 PM, so meeting her for 15 minutes from 12:03 to 12:18.\n\nThen, after that, the next possible is Jeffrey at Bayview, but he's available from 5:30 PM. So, the user would have some free time between 12:18 and 5:30.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better order. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Kevin, maybe go to Barbara, then perhaps try to fit in another meeting before Jeffrey.\n\nWait, after Barbara, the user is at Financial District at 12:18. From there, where to go? Jeffrey is at Bayview, but he's not available until 5:30. So, the user could stay in the Financial District until 5:30, but that's a long wait. Alternatively, perhaps go back to Golden Gate Park or another location, but that might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, after Barbara, perhaps go to Jeffrey early, but he's not available until 5:30. So, the user would have to wait until then.\n\nSo, perhaps the order is:\n\n1. Joseph (9:24 - 10:54)\n2. Kevin (11:16 - 11:46)\n3. Barbara (12:03 - 12:18)\n4. Jeffrey (5:30 - 6:30)\n\nBut let's check the travel times:\n\nAfter Barbara, the user is at Financial District at 12:18. To get to Bayview, the travel time from Financial District to Bayview is 19 minutes. So, leaving at 12:18, arrives at 12:37. But Jeffrey isn't available until 5:30. So, the user would have to wait until 5:30. Then, the meeting with Jeffrey would be from 5:30 to 6:30 (60 minutes).\n\nBut wait, the user can't do anything else in between. So, that's a lot of waiting time. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, after Barbara, perhaps the user can go to another location, but all other friends have already been met. So, perhaps that's the best order.\n\nWait, but what about the order of Kevin and Barbara? Maybe meeting Barbara first after Joseph.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n1. Joseph: 9:24 - 10:54\n2. Barbara: From Fisherman's Wharf to Financial District: 11 minutes. So, leaving at 10:54, arrives at 11:05. Barbara is available from 10:30, so can meet from 11:05 to 11:20 (15 minutes). Then, from Financial District to Mission District: 17 minutes. Arrives at 11:37. Kevin is available until 3:15 PM, so meeting from 11:37 to 12:07 (30 minutes). Then, from Mission District to Bayview: 15 minutes. Arrives at 12:22. But Jeffrey isn't available until 5:30, so have to wait.\n\nIn this order, the user meets Joseph, Barbara, Kevin, and Jeffrey. That's four meetings, which is better than the previous order which also had four.\n\nWait, but in the first order, the user met Joseph, Kevin, Barbara, Jeffrey. So, same number.\n\nBut in the second order, the times are:\n\nJoseph: 9:24 -10:54\n\nTravel to Financial District: 11 minutes, arrives 11:05.\n\nBarbara: 11:05 - 11:20 (15 mins)\n\nTravel to Mission District: 17 mins, arrives 11:37.\n\nKevin: 11:37 - 12:07 (30 mins)\n\nTravel to Bayview: 15 mins, arrives 12:22.\n\nWait until 5:30 PM to meet Jeffrey: 5:30 -6:30.\n\nSo, the itinerary includes all four friends.\n\nBut in the first order, the user met Joseph, Kevin, Barbara, Jeffrey.\n\nWhich is also four friends.\n\nSo, both orders allow meeting four friends. But perhaps the second order is better because it allows meeting Barbara earlier, but I'm not sure if it affects the total number.\n\nWait, but in the first order, after Barbara, the user has to wait until 5:30 PM, which is a long time. In the second order, after Kevin, the user also has to wait until 5:30 PM. So, both have the same waiting time.\n\nBut perhaps the order doesn't matter in terms of the number of meetings, but maybe in terms of the total time spent traveling or waiting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to fit in more meetings, but I don't think so because David can't be met, and the others are four.\n\nWait, let me think again about David. He's available until 9:00 AM, and the user arrives at 9:00 AM. So, can the user meet him for a few minutes? But the meeting needs to be at least 30 minutes. So, if the user arrives at 9:00, the earliest they can leave is 9:30, but David is only available until 9:00. So, it's impossible. Therefore, David can't be met.\n\nSo, the maximum number of meetings is four.\n\nNow, let's think about the travel times and the order.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Joseph (9:24 -10:54)\n2. Kevin (11:16 -11:46)\n3. Barbara (12:03 -12:18)\n4. Jeffrey (5:30 -6:30)\n\nOption 2:\n\n1. Joseph (9:24 -10:54)\n2. Barbara (11:05 -11:20)\n3. Kevin (11:37 -12:07)\n4. Jeffrey (5:30 -6:30)\n\nBoth options meet four friends. The travel times are similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after meeting Barbara, the user can go back to Golden Gate Park and then to Bayview, but that might not help.\n\nWait, another idea: after meeting Barbara at 12:18, the user is at Financial District. From there, perhaps go to Embarcadero to meet someone else, but David is already not available, and the others are already met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can go to Embarcadero after Barbara, but there's no one to meet there. So, no.\n\nSo, the best is to meet four friends in either order.\n\nNow, let's compute the exact times for each option.\n\nOption 1:\n\nStart at Golden Gate Park at 9:00.\n\nTravel to Fisherman's Wharf: 24 mins. Arrive at 9:24.\n\nMeet Joseph: 9:24 -10:54 (90 mins).\n\nLeave at 10:54.\n\nTravel to Mission District: 22 mins. Arrive at 11:16.\n\nMeet Kevin: 11:16 -11:46 (30 mins).\n\nLeave at 11:46.\n\nTravel to Financial District: 17 mins. Arrive at 12:03 PM.\n\nMeet Barbara: 12:03 -12:18 (15 mins).\n\nLeave at 12:18.\n\nTravel to Bayview: 19 mins. Arrive at 12:37.\n\nWait until 5:30 PM.\n\nMeet Jeffrey: 5:30 -6:30 (60 mins).\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n\n[\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"9:24\", \"end_time\": \"10:54\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Mission District\", \"person\": \"Kevin\", \"start_time\": \"11:16\", \"end_time\": \"11:46\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"12:03\", \"end_time\": \"12:18\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Bayview\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"17:30\", \"end_time\": \"18:30\"}\n]\n\nWait, but 5:30 PM is 17:30 in 24-hour format, so end time is 18:30.\n\nOption 2:\n\nStart at Golden Gate Park at 9:00.\n\nTravel to Fisherman's Wharf: 24 mins. Arrive at 9:24.\n\nMeet Joseph: 9:24 -10:54.\n\nLeave at 10:54.\n\nTravel to Financial District: 11 mins. Arrive at 11:05.\n\nMeet Barbara: 11:05 -11:20.\n\nLeave at 11:20.\n\nTravel to Mission District: 17 mins. Arrive at 11:37.\n\nMeet Kevin: 11:37 -12:07.\n\nLeave at 12:07.\n\nTravel to Bayview: 15 mins. Arrive at 12:22.\n\nWait until 5:30 PM.\n\nMeet Jeffrey: 5:30 -6:30.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n\n[\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"9:24\", \"end_time\": \"10:54\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"11:05\", \"end_time\": \"11:20\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Mission District\", \"person\": \"Kevin\", \"start_time\": \"11:37\", \"end_time\": \"12:07\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Bayview\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"17:30\", \"end_time\": \"18:30\"}\n]\n\nBoth options are valid. Now, the question is which one is better. Since both allow four meetings, but perhaps the second option is more efficient because after Barbara, the user can go to Kevin without waiting, whereas in the first option, after Kevin, the user has to go to Barbara, which is a bit further.\n\nBut in terms of total waiting time, both have the same issue of waiting from 12:22 to 17:30.\n\nI think either order is acceptable, but perhaps the second option is better because it allows the user to meet Barbara earlier, which might be better in case any meeting runs late, but in this case, all meetings are scheduled exactly.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the second option.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into a Python program.\n\nThe program needs to:\n\n1. Read the input parameters, including travel times and constraints.\n\n2. Compute the optimal schedule.\n\n3. Output the JSON with the itinerary.\n\nFirst, I'll represent the travel times as a dictionary, perhaps with the from and to locations as keys.\n\nThen, for each friend, I'll have their location, available start and end times, and the required meeting duration.\n\nI'll need to process the friends in an order that maximizes the number of meetings, considering their availability and the travel times.\n\nI think the approach is to:\n\n- Start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM.\n\n- For each possible next friend, check if it's possible to meet them, considering the travel time from the current location and whether their availability window allows a meeting of the required duration.\n\n- Choose the friend that allows the earliest possible meeting, or perhaps prioritize based on the earliest end time to leave room for more meetings.\n\nBut since the user wants to meet as many friends as possible, perhaps a greedy approach, trying to meet as many as possible in the order that allows the most meetings.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of friends is small, perhaps generate all possible permutations of the friends and check which permutation allows the maximum number of meetings without time conflicts.\n\nBut that might be computationally intensive, but with only four friends, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Represent each friend as a dictionary with their name, location, start time, end time, and required duration.\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these friends.\n\n3. For each permutation, simulate the schedule:\n\n   a. Start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00.\n\n   b. For each friend in the permutation order:\n\n      i. Calculate the travel time from the current location to the friend's location.\n\n      ii. Determine the earliest possible start time for the meeting, which is the maximum of:\n\n          - The arrival time at the friend's location.\n\n          - The friend's available start time.\n\n      iii. Check if the meeting can end before the friend's available end time.\n\n          - The meeting ends at start_time + duration.\n\n          - If this end time is <= friend's end time, then it's possible.\n\n      iv. If possible, add this meeting to the itinerary, update the current location and current time.\n\n      v. If not possible, skip this friend and continue to the next.\n\n4. After processing all permutations, select the permutation that results in the maximum number of meetings.\n\n5. If multiple permutations result in the same number of meetings, choose the one with the earliest end time or the first one encountered.\n\nOnce the optimal permutation is found, format the itinerary into the required JSON structure.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, I'll define the travel times as a dictionary. Each key will be a tuple (from_location, to_location), and the value is the travel time in minutes.\n\nThen, define the friends as a list of dictionaries.\n\nNext, generate all permutations of the friends (excluding David, since he can't be met).\n\nFor each permutation, simulate the schedule:\n\n- Initialize current_time as 9:00 (converted to minutes since midnight for easier calculations).\n\n- Initialize current_location as 'Golden Gate Park'.\n\n- Initialize the itinerary for this permutation as an empty list.\n\n- For each friend in the permutation:\n\n   - Calculate the travel time from current_location to friend's location.\n\n   - Convert current_time and friend's start and end times to minutes for easier calculations.\n\n   - arrival_time = current_time + travel_time.\n\n   - meeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend_start_time).\n\n   - meeting_end = meeting_start + required_duration.\n\n   - if meeting_end <= friend_end_time:\n\n      - add the meeting to the itinerary.\n\n      - update current_time to meeting_end.\n\n      - update current_location to friend's location.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - skip this friend.\n\nAfter processing all friends in the permutation, count the number of meetings. Keep track of the permutation with the maximum meetings.\n\nOnce all permutations are processed, select the one with the highest count.\n\nIf multiple have the same count, choose the one that ends earliest or the first one.\n\nThen, convert the itinerary into the required JSON format.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nTravel times:\n\nWe'll create a dictionary where each key is a tuple (from_loc, to_loc), and the value is the time in minutes.\n\nFriends:\n\nEach friend is a dictionary with:\n\n- name\n\n- location\n\n- start_time (in minutes since midnight)\n\n- end_time (in minutes since midnight)\n\n- duration (required meeting time in minutes)\n\nFor example, Joseph:\n\nlocation: 'Fisherman's Wharf'\n\nstart_time: 8*60 = 480 minutes (8:00 AM)\n\nend_time: 17*60 + 30 = 1050 minutes (5:30 PM)\n\nduration: 90 minutes.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut wait, the user's day starts at 9:00 AM, which is 540 minutes.\n\nSo, for each friend, we have:\n\nJoseph:\n\nstart: 480 (8:00)\n\nend: 1050 (17:30)\n\nduration: 90.\n\nJeffrey:\n\nstart: 1050 (17:30)\n\nend: 1170 (19:30)\n\nduration: 60.\n\nKevin:\n\nstart: 11*60 +15 = 675 (11:15)\n\nend: 15*60 +15= 915 (15:15? Wait, no, 3:15 PM is 15:15, which is 15*60 +15= 915? Wait, 3:15 PM is 15:15, which is 15*60 +15= 915 minutes.\n\nWait, 3:15 PM is 15:15, which is 15*60 +15= 915 minutes since midnight.\n\nYes.\n\nBarbara:\n\nstart: 10*60 +30= 630 (10:30 AM)\n\nend: 16*60 +30= 990 (16:30 is 4:30 PM, which is 16*60 +30= 990.\n\nWait, 4:30 PM is 16:30, which is 16*60 +30= 990.\n\nYes.\n\nDavid:\n\nstart: 8*60 +15= 495 (8:15 AM)\n\nend: 9*60= 540 (9:00 AM)\n\nduration: 30.\n\nBut as discussed, he can't be met.\n\nSo, in the friends list, we can exclude David.\n\nNow, the friends list is:\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Joseph',\n        'location': 'Fisherman's Wharf',\n        'start': 480,\n        'end': 1050,\n        'duration': 90\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Jeffrey',\n        'location': 'Bayview',\n        'start': 1050,\n        'end': 1170,\n        'duration': 60\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Kevin',\n        'location': 'Mission District',\n        'start': 675,\n        'end': 915,\n        'duration': 30\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Barbara',\n        'location': 'Financial District',\n        'start': 630,\n        'end': 990,\n        'duration': 15\n    }\n]\n\nWait, but Jeffrey's start is 1050 (17:30), which is 5:30 PM.\n\nNow, the code will process these friends.\n\nNext, the travel times. The user provided a list of travel times between various locations. I'll need to parse those into the dictionary.\n\nFor example:\n\nGolden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24.\n\nSo, travel_times[('Golden Gate Park', 'Fisherman's Wharf')] = 24.\n\nSimilarly for all other pairs.\n\nI'll create the travel_times dictionary with all the provided data.\n\nOnce that's done, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\n1. Define the travel_times dictionary.\n\n2. Define the friends list, excluding David.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the friends.\n\n4. For each permutation:\n\n   a.

Keep track of the permutation with the maximum number of meetings. If tie, choose the one with the earliest end time.\n\n6. Once the best itinerary is found, output it as JSON.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, generating all permutations might be computationally feasible since there are 4 friends, so 4! =24 permutations. For each permutation, we process 4 friends, so total operations are manageable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFirst, import necessary modules: itertools for permutations.\n\nThen, define the travel_times.\n\nThen, define the friends.\n\nThen, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(friends):\n\n   simulate the schedule.\n\n   keep track of the best itinerary.\n\nOnce all permutations are processed, output the best itinerary.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut I need to handle time conversions. For example, 540 minutes is 9:00 AM, which is '9:00'.\n\nSo, functions to convert minutes to 'H:MM' format.\n\nSimilarly, parse the times correctly.\n\nLet me write helper functions:\n\ndef minutes_to_time(m):\n    hours = m // 60\n    mins = m % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nWait, but the output requires times in 'H:MM' without leading zero for hours. So, for 9:00, it's '9:00', not '09:00'.\n\nSo, the function should return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\".\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the output should be in 'H:MM' format, like '9:00' or '13:30' (no leading zero). So, the hours part should not have leading zeros.\n\nSo, the helper function would be:\n\ndef minutes_to_time(m):\n    hours = m // 60\n    mins = m % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nWait, but for m=540, 540//60=9, 540%60=0 \u2192 '9:00'.\n\nFor m=600 \u2192 10:00.\n\nFor m=63 \u2192 1:03.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement the above logic.\n\nBut wait, in the friends list, the start and end times are in minutes since midnight.\n\nSo, when processing each friend, for a given permutation, the code will:\n\n- For each friend in the permutation:\n\n   - travel_time = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n\n   - if travel_time is None: can't go, skip.\n\n   - arrival_time = current_time + travel_time\n\n   - meeting_start = max(arrival_time, friend['start'])\n\n   - meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n\n   - if meeting_end > friend['end']: skip.\n\n   - else: add to itinerary.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut wait, what if a location is not reachable because the travel_time is not in the dictionary? For example, if the current_location is X and friend's location is Y, but (X,Y) is not in travel_times. But according to the problem, all necessary travel times are provided, so this shouldn't happen.\n\nNow, let's proceed.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nimport itertools\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Fisherman's Wharf'): 24,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Bayview'): 23,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Mission District'): 17,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Embarcadero'): 25,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Financial District'): 26,\n    ('Fisherman's Wharf', 'Golden Gate Park'): 25,\n    ('Fisherman's Wharf', 'Bayview'): 26,\n    ('Fisherman's Wharf', 'Mission District'): 22,\n    ('Fisherman's Wharf', 'Embarcadero'): 8,\n    ('Fisherman's Wharf', 'Financial District'): 11,\n    ('Bayview', 'Golden Gate Park'): 22,\n    ('Bayview', 'Fisherman's Wharf'): 25,\n    ('Bayview', 'Mission District'): 13,\n    ('Bayview', 'Embarcadero'): 19,\n    ('Bayview', 'Financial District'): 19,\n    ('Mission District', 'Golden Gate Park'): 17,\n    ('Mission District', 'Fisherman's Wharf'): 22,\n    ('Mission District', 'Bayview'): 15,\n    ('Mission District', 'Embarcadero'): 19,\n    ('Mission District', 'Financial District'): 17,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Golden Gate Park'): 25,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Fisherman's Wharf'): 6,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Bayview'): 21,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Mission District'): 20,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Financial District'): 5,\n    ('Financial District', 'Golden Gate Park'): 23,\n    ('Financial District', 'Fisherman's Wharf'): 10,\n    ('Financial District', 'Bayview'): 19,\n    ('Financial District', 'Mission District'): 17,\n    ('Financial District', 'Embarcadero'): 4,\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Joseph',\n        'location': 'Fisherman's Wharf',\n        'start': 480,  # 8:00 AM\n        'end': 1050,   # 17:30\n        'duration': 90\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Jeffrey',\n        'location': 'Bayview',\n        'start': 1050, # 17:30\n        'end': 1170,   # 19:30\n        'duration': 60\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Kevin',\n        'location': 'Mission District',\n        'start': 675,  # 11:15\n        'end': 915,    # 15:15\n        'duration': 30\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Barbara',\n        'location': 'Financial District',\n        'start': 630,  # 10:30\n        'end': 990,    # 16:30\n        'duration': 15\n    }\n]\n\ndef minutes_to_time(m):\n    hours = m // 60\n    mins = m % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nbest_itinerary = []\nmax_meetings = 0\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n    current_location = 'Golden Gate Park'\n    itinerary = []\n    \n    for friend in perm:\n        # Get travel time\n        travel = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n        if travel is None:\n            continue  # shouldn't happen\n        \n        arrival = current_time + travel\n        meeting_start = max(arrival, friend['start'])\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n        \n        if meeting_end > friend['end']:\n            continue\n        \n        # Add to itinerary\n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_start),\n            'end_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n        })\n        \n        current_time = meeting_end\n        current_location = friend['location']\n    \n    if len(itinerary) > max_meetings:\n        max_meetings = len(itinerary)\n        best_itinerary = itinerary\n\n# Now, construct the output\noutput = {\n    \"itinerary\": best_itinerary\n}\n\nimport json\nprint(json.dumps(output))\nWait, but this code may not work as is because the friends are being permuted as dictionaries, and in each permutation, the order is considered. But in the code above, the friends are processed in the order of the permutation.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each permutation, the friends are processed in the order they appear in the permutation. So, for each permutation, it's a different order.\n\nBut in the code, the friends are being taken as objects, and in each permutation, the order is considered.\n\nWait, no. The code uses itertools.permutations(friends), which generates all possible orderings of the friends list. Each perm is a tuple of the friend dictionaries in a particular order.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, the friends are stored as a list of dictionaries, and each permutation is a tuple of these dictionaries in a different order.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nTesting this code, let's see what happens.\n\nBut in the code, the friends list includes Joseph, Jeffrey, Kevin, Barbara.\n\nSo, the permutations will cover all possible orders.\n\nIn the best case, the code finds a permutation that allows four meetings.\n\nBut in practice, when the code runs, it may find that some permutations allow four meetings, others less.\n\nFor example, if the permutation starts with Jeffrey, who is only available from 5:30 PM, the user can't meet him early, so that permutation would have fewer meetings.\n\nSimilarly, starting with Kevin may allow more meetings.\n\nBut the code should find the permutation that allows the maximum number of meetings.\n\nNow, let's see what the code would output.\n\nIn the earlier manual calculation, we found that meeting Joseph, Barbara, Kevin, Jeffrey is possible, which is four meetings.\n\nSo, the code should find that permutation and output it.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIn the code, the first friend in the permutation is processed first.\n\nSo, if the permutation is (Joseph, Barbara, Kevin, Jeffrey), the code would process:\n\n1. Joseph: arrival at 9:24, meeting 9:24-10:54.\n\n2. Barbara: travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Financial District is 11 mins, arrives at 10:54 +11= 11:05. Barbara's start is 10:30, so meeting starts at 11:05. Duration 15 mins, ends at 11:20.\n\n3. Kevin: travel from Financial District to Mission District is 17 mins, arrives at 11:20+17=11:37. Kevin's start is 11:15, so meeting starts at 11:37. Duration 30 mins, ends at 12:07.\n\n4. Jeffrey: travel from Mission District to Bayview is 15 mins, arrives at 12:07+15=12:22. Jeffrey's start is 17:30, so meeting starts at 17:30. Duration 60 mins, ends at 18:30.\n\nSo, the itinerary would have four meetings.\n\nThus, the code should capture this.\n\nNow, the code will output this itinerary.\n\nBut in the code, the output is a JSON string.\n\nSo, the code should print:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"9:24\", \"end_time\": \"10:54\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"11:05\", \"end_time\": \"11:20\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Mission District\", \"person\": \"Kevin\", \"start_time\": \"11:37\", \"end_time\": \"12:07\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Bayview\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"17:30\", \"end_time\": \"18:30\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nWhich is the desired output.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the 'friends' list is defined in the order Joseph, Jeffrey, Kevin, Barbara. So, the permutation (Joseph, Barbara, Kevin, Jeffrey) is one of the possible permutations, and the code should find it.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the code correctly processes the permutations and selects the one with the maximum meetings.\n\nI think this should solve the problem.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to plan an optimal meeting schedule for a day in San Francisco, considering various friends' availability and travel times between locations. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible while respecting their time constraints and minimizing travel time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The user starts at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM and needs to meet four friends at different locations with specific time windows and meeting durations. The challenge is to find the optimal order of meetings to maximize the number of friends met without overlapping times and considering travel durations.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By generating all possible permutations of the friends, we can simulate each possible meeting order and determine which permutation allows the maximum number of meetings. This brute-force approach is feasible due to the small number of friends (four), resulting in 24 permutations.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a permutation-based approach to explore all possible meeting orders. For each permutation, we simulate the schedule, considering travel times and availability constraints to check if a meeting is feasible. The permutation yielding the highest number of meetings is selected as the optimal schedule.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm generates 24 permutations, each requiring up to 4 meeting simulations. This results in a manageable computational effort given the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Fisherman's Wharf'): 24,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Bayview'): 23,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Mission District'): 17,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Embarcadero'): 25,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Financial District'): 26,\n    ('Fisherman's Wharf', 'Golden Gate Park'): 25,\n    ('Fisherman's Wharf', 'Bayview'): 26,\n    ('Fisherman's Wharf', 'Mission District'): 22,\n    ('Fisherman's Wharf', 'Embarcadero'): 8,\n    ('Fisherman's Wharf', 'Financial District'): 11,\n    ('Bayview', 'Golden Gate Park'): 22,\n    ('Bayview', 'Fisherman's Wharf'): 25,\n    ('Bayview', 'Mission District'): 13,\n    ('Bayview', 'Embarcadero'): 19,\n    ('Bayview', 'Financial District'): 19,\n    ('Mission District', 'Golden Gate Park'): 17,\n    ('Mission District', 'Fisherman's Wharf'): 22,\n    ('Mission District', 'Bayview'): 15,\n    ('Mission District', 'Embarcadero'): 19,\n    ('Mission District', 'Financial District'): 17,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Golden Gate Park'): 25,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Fisherman's Wharf'): 6,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Bayview'): 21,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Mission District'): 20,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Financial District'): 5,\n    ('Financial District', 'Golden Gate Park'): 23,\n    ('Financial District', 'Fisherman's Wharf'): 10,\n    ('Financial District', 'Bayview'): 19,\n    ('Financial District', 'Mission District'): 17,\n    ('Financial District', 'Embarcadero'): 4,\n}\n\nfriends = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Joseph',\n        'location': 'Fisherman's Wharf',\n        'start': 480,\n        'end': 1050,\n        'duration': 90\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Jeffrey',\n        'location': 'Bayview',\n        'start': 1050,\n        'end': 1170,\n        'duration': 60\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Kevin',\n        'location': 'Mission District',\n        'start': 675,\n        'end': 915,\n        'duration': 30\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Barbara',\n        'location': 'Financial District',\n        'start': 630,\n        'end': 990,\n        'duration': 15\n    }\n]\n\ndef minutes_to_time(m):\n    hours = m // 60\n    mins = m % 60\n    return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\nbest_itinerary = []\nmax_meetings = 0\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(friends):\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM\n    current_location = 'Golden Gate Park'\n    itinerary = []\n    \n    for friend in perm:\n        travel = travel_times.get((current_location, friend['location']), None)\n        if travel is None:\n            continue\n        \n        arrival = current_time + travel\n        meeting_start = max(arrival, friend['start'])\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + friend['duration']\n        \n        if meeting_end > friend['end']:\n            continue\n        \n        itinerary.append({\n            'action': 'meet',\n            'location': friend['location'],\n            'person': friend['name'],\n            'start_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_start),\n            'end_time': minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n        })\n        \n        current_time = meeting_end\n        current_location = friend['location']\n    \n    if len(itinerary) > max_meetings:\n        max_meetings = len(itinerary)\n        best_itinerary = itinerary\n\noutput = {\n    \"itinerary\": best_itinerary\n}\n\nimport json\nprint(json.dumps(output))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Travel Times and Friends Data**: The code starts by defining travel times between locations and the friends' availability data, including their names, locations, available times, and required meeting durations.\n\n2. **Time Conversion**: A helper function `minutes_to_time` converts minutes since midnight into 'H:MM' format for the output.\n\n3. **Permutations and Simulation**: The code generates all permutations of the friends to explore every possible meeting order.
