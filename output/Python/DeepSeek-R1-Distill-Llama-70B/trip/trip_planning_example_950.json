            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python program that calculates an optimal travel itinerary based on given constraints. Let's break down what the problem is asking for.\n\nFirst, the user wants to visit 7 European cities over 17 days. They can only take direct flights between cities. Each city has a specific number of days they want to stay there, and some cities have events happening on specific days that they need to attend.\n\nThe cities and their desired stay durations are:\n- Mykonos: 3 days (with a wedding between day 4 and 6)\n- Riga: 3 days\n- Munich: 4 days\n- Bucharest: 4 days\n- Rome: 4 days (with a conference between day 1 and 4)\n- Nice: 3 days\n- Krakow: 2 days (with an annual show between day 16 and 17)\n\nThe direct flights available between these cities are listed, and the goal is to find a feasible itinerary that respects all these constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the cities and their flight connections. I'll create a dictionary for cities with their stay durations and another for direct flights.\n\nNext, I need to plan the trip. The key here is to ensure that the traveler attends all events on the specified days. So, I should start by scheduling the cities with fixed events first.\n\nRome has a conference from day 1 to 4, so it makes sense to start there. After Rome, the traveler needs to reach Mykonos for the wedding by day 4. Looking at the flights, Rome can fly directly to Mykonos, which fits perfectly.\n\nAfter Mykonos, the next event is in Krakow from day 16 to 17. But before that, the traveler needs to visit the other cities. From Mykonos, there's a direct flight to Munich, which is a good next step. Munich has a 4-day stay, which can be adjusted to fit the timeline.\n\nFrom Munich, there's a direct flight to Krakow, but the traveler needs to be there by day 16. So, after Munich, perhaps visiting Nice, Bucharest, and Riga before heading to Krakow makes sense. Each of these cities has direct flights that can be used to sequence the trip properly.\n\nI also need to ensure that the total days add up to 17 and that all events are attended without overlap. Adjusting the stay durations slightly where possible will help make the itinerary feasible.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the itinerary by adding each city's stay and the flights between them, making sure the days align correctly.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nclass TripPlanner:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.cities = {\n            'Rome': 4,\n            'Mykonos': 3,\n            'Riga': 3,\n            'Munich': 4,\n            'Bucharest': 4,\n            'Nice': 3,\n            'Krakow': 2\n        }\n        self.direct_flights = {\n            'Rome': ['Nice', 'Munich', 'Mykonos', 'Bucharest'],\n            'Mykonos': ['Munich', 'Nice'],\n            'Riga': ['Bucharest', 'Munich'],\n            'Munich': ['Krakow', 'Nice', 'Riga'],\n            'Bucharest': ['Munich', 'Riga'],\n            'Nice': ['Munich', 'Riga'],\n            'Krakow': []\n        }\n        self.itinerary = []\n        self.current_day = 1\n\n    def plan_trip(self):\n        # Start with Rome for the conference\n        self.add_place('Rome', 4)\n        # Fly to Mykonos for the wedding\n        self.add_flight('Rome', 'Mykonos')\n        self.add_place('Mykonos', 3)\n        # Fly to Munich\n        self.add_flight('Mykonos', 'Munich')\n        self.add_place('Munich', 4)\n        # Fly to Nice\n        self.add_flight('Munich', 'Nice')\n        self.add_place('Nice', 3)\n        # Fly to Bucharest\n        self.add_flight('Nice', 'Bucharest')\n        self.add_place('Bucharest', 4)\n        # Fly to Riga\n        self.add_flight('Bucharest', 'Riga')\n        self.add_place('Riga', 3)\n        # Fly to Krakow for the annual show\n        self.add_flight('Riga', 'Krakow')\n        self.add_place('Krakow', 2)\n\n    def add_place(self, place, days):\n        end_day = self.current_day + days - 1\n        self.itinerary.append({'day_range': f'Day {self.current_day}-{end_day}', 'place': place})\n        self.current_day = end_day + 1\n\n    def add_flight(self, from_city, to_city):\n        self.itinerary.append({'flying': f'Day {self.current_day}-{self.current_day}', 'from': from_city, 'to': to_city})\n        self.current_day += 1\n\nplanner = TripPlanner()\nplanner.plan_trip()\nprint(json.dumps(planner.itinerary))\n```",
