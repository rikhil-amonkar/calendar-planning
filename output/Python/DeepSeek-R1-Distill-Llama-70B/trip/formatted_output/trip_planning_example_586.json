            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The user wants to visit 5 European cities in 12 days, with specific constraints on the number of days to stay in each city and certain events they want to attend. They also provided direct flight connections between these cities.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the cities and their required durations:\n- Frankfurt: 3 days\n- Naples: 4 days\n- Helsinki: 4 days (with an annual show from day 2 to day 5)\n- Lyon: 3 days\n- Prague: 2 days (with a workshop from day 1 to day 2)\n\nNext, I'll look at the flight connections to understand how these cities are linked:\n- Prague connects to Lyon, Frankfurt, and Helsinki.\n- Frankfurt connects to Lyon, Naples, and Helsinki.\n- Helsinki connects to Naples and Frankfurt.\n- Naples connects to Frankfurt.\n- Lyon doesn't have any outgoing flights except to Prague.\n\nThe user's constraints are quite specific, especially the timing of the events. They need to attend a workshop in Prague between day 1 and day 2 and an annual show in Helsinki from day 2 to day 5. This means they must be in Prague on day 1 and Helsinki from day 2 to day 5.\n\nGiven these constraints, I'll start by scheduling the workshop in Prague on day 1. Since they can't be in two places at once, the next logical step is to fly to Helsinki on day 2 to attend the annual show. After the show ends on day 5, they can fly to Frankfurt, which has a direct flight from Helsinki.\n\nIn Frankfurt, they'll spend 3 days, which fits their requirement. From Frankfurt, they can fly to Naples, where they'll stay for 4 days. Finally, from Naples, they can fly back to Frankfurt to catch a flight to Lyon, where they'll spend the remaining 3 days.\n\nI need to ensure that the transitions between cities happen on the same day they arrive and depart, as per the rules. Also, I must make sure that the total days add up to 12.\n\nSo, the itinerary would look like this:\n1. Day 1: Prague\n2. Day 2-5: Helsinki (annual show)\n3. Day 5: Fly to Frankfurt\n4. Day 5-7: Frankfurt\n5. Day 8: Fly to Naples\n6. Day 8-11: Naples\n7. Day 12: Fly to Lyon\n8. Day 12-14: Lyon\n\nWait, that's 14 days, which exceeds the 12-day limit. I must adjust this.\n\nRevising the plan:\n1. Day 1: Prague\n2. Day 2-5: Helsinki\n3. Day 6: Fly to Frankfurt\n4. Day 6-8: Frankfurt\n5. Day 9: Fly to Naples\n6. Day 9-12: Naples\n\nThis fits perfectly into 12 days, with all constraints met.\n\nNow, I'll write the Python code to generate this itinerary in the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Define the cities and their required durations\ncities = {\n    'Prague': 2,\n    'Frankfurt': 3,\n    'Naples': 4,\n    'Helsinki': 4,\n    'Lyon': 3\n}\n\n# Define flight connections\nflight_connections = {\n    'Prague': {'Lyon', 'Frankfurt', 'Helsinki'},\n    'Frankfurt': {'Lyon', 'Naples', 'Helsinki'},\n    'Helsinki': {'Naples', 'Frankfurt'},\n    'Naples': {'Frankfurt'},\n    'Lyon': set()\n}\n\nitinerary = []\n\n# Start with Prague for the workshop\ncurrent_day = 1\nend_day = current_day + cities['Prague'] - 1\nitinerary.append({'day_range': f'Day {current_day}-{end_day}', 'place': 'Prague'})\ncurrent_day = end_day + 1\n\n# Fly to Helsinki for the annual show\nflight_day = 2\nitinerary.append({'flying': f'Day {flight_day}-{flight_day}', 'from': 'Prague', 'to': 'Helsinki'})\n\n# Stay in Helsinki\nstart_day = flight_day\nend_day = start_day + cities['Helsinki'] - 1\nitinerary.append({'day_range': f'Day {start_day}-{end_day}', 'place': 'Helsinki'})\ncurrent_day = end_day + 1\n\n# Fly to Frankfurt\nflight_day = 6\nitinerary.append({'flying': f'Day {flight_day}-{flight_day}', 'from': 'Helsinki', 'to': 'Frankfurt'})\n\n# Stay in Frankfurt\nstart_day = flight_day\nend_day = start_day + cities['Frankfurt'] - 1\nitinerary.append({'day_range': f'Day {start_day}-{end_day}', 'place': 'Frankfurt'})\ncurrent_day = end_day + 1\n\n# Fly to Naples\nflight_day = 9\nitinerary.append({'flying': f'Day {flight_day}-{flight_day}', 'from': 'Frankfurt', 'to': 'Naples'})\n\n# Stay in Naples\nstart_day = flight_day\nend_day = start_day + cities['Naples'] - 1\nitinerary.append({'day_range': f'Day {start_day}-{end_day}', 'place': 'Naples'})\ncurrent_day = end_day + 1\n\n# Fly to Lyon\nflight_day = 13\nitinerary.append({'flying': f'Day {flight_day}-{flight_day}', 'from': 'Naples', 'to': 'Lyon'})\n\n# Stay in Lyon\nstart_day = flight_day\nend_day = start_day + cities['Lyon'] - 1\nitinerary.append({'day_range': f'Day {start_day}-{end_day}', 'place': 'Lyon'})\ncurrent_day = end_day + 1\n\n# Output the itinerary\nprint(json.dumps(itinerary))\n```",
