            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to write a Python program that calculates an optimal itinerary for visiting 10 European cities over 27 days, considering various constraints like specific days for events and direct flights between cities. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I should list out all the cities and their required stays:\n- Warsaw: 3 days\n- Porto: 5 days (workshop between day 1-5)\n- Naples: 4 days (conference on day 17-20)\n- Brussels: 3 days (annual show day 20-22)\n- Split: 3 days\n- Reykjavik: 5 days\n- Amsterdam: 4 days (visit relatives day 5-8)\n- Lyon: 3 days\n- Helsinki: 4 days (wedding day 8-11)\n- Valencia: 2 days\n\nNext, I need to consider the direct flights between these cities. The flights are given, so I'll map each city to its direct connections.\n\nNow, the constraints are pretty tight. For example, the workshop in Porto must be between day 1-5, and the wedding in Helsinki is day 8-11. Also, the annual show in Brussels is day 20-22, which overlaps with the Naples conference. That might require careful scheduling to ensure all events are attended without conflict.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the earliest fixed event, which is the workshop in Porto on day 1-5. So, the trip should start in Porto. From there, I need to find a path that allows visiting all cities within their required days and respecting the direct flight connections.\n\nAfter Porto, where to go? Let's see the direct flights from Porto: Brussels, Amsterdam, Lyon, Warsaw. Maybe going to Amsterdam next since there's a need to be there by day 5-8. But wait, the workshop ends on day 5, so perhaps flying to Amsterdam on day 5.\n\nIn Amsterdam, stay for 4 days (days 5-8), which aligns with visiting relatives. Then, from Amsterdam, direct flights include Helsinki, which has the wedding on day 8-11. Perfect, fly to Helsinki on day 8.\n\nAfter the wedding in Helsinki (days 8-11), where next? Direct flights from Helsinki include Naples, Reykjavik, and Split. Naples has a conference on days 17-20, so maybe head there next. But the stay in Naples is 4 days, so perhaps days 11-14, but the conference is later. Wait, the conference is days 17-20, so maybe after Naples, go to another city and come back? That might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, after Helsinki, go to Reykjavik for 5 days (days 11-15). Then from Reykjavik, fly to Brussels (direct flight available) for the annual show on days 20-22. But Brussels needs a 3-day stay, so days 20-22. Wait, but Reykjavik to Brussels is a direct flight, but the timing needs to fit.\n\nWait, let's try to outline a possible path:\n\n1. Porto (days 1-5)\n2. Amsterdam (days 5-8)\n3. Helsinki (days 8-11)\n4. Reykjavik (days 11-15)\n5. Brussels (days 15-17)\n6. Naples (days 17-20)\n7. Valencia (days 20-21)\n8. Lyon (days 21-23)\n9. Split (days 23-25)\n10. Warsaw (days 25-27)\n\nBut wait, this doesn't cover all cities, and some stays might not fit. Also, the flights need to be direct. Let me check the flight connections again.\n\nPorto can fly to Amsterdam, which is good. Amsterdam to Helsinki is direct. Helsinki to Reykjavik is direct. Reykjavik to Brussels is direct. Brussels to Naples? No, but Brussels can fly to Valencia, and Valencia to Naples isn't direct. Hmm, maybe from Brussels to Naples via another city, but that's not allowed since only direct flights are permitted.\n\nAlternatively, from Brussels, fly to Lyon (direct), then Lyon to Split (direct), Split to Naples (direct). But that would take more days.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should adjust the order to ensure all events are attended and flights are direct.\n\nPerhaps after Porto, go to Amsterdam, then Helsinki, then Reykjavik, then Brussels for the show, then Naples for the conference, then Valencia, Lyon, Split, and finally Warsaw.\n\nBut I need to make sure the days align without overlapping. Let me try to map this out step by step, ensuring each flight is direct and the stays fit within the 27 days.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nclass TripPlanner:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.cities = {\n            'Porto': 5,\n            'Amsterdam': 4,\n            'Helsinki': 4,\n            'Reykjavik': 5,\n            'Brussels': 3,\n            'Naples': 4,\n            'Valencia': 2,\n            'Lyon': 3,\n            'Split': 3,\n            'Warsaw': 3\n        }\n        self.flights = {\n            'Porto': ['Brussels', 'Amsterdam', 'Lyon', 'Warsaw'],\n            'Amsterdam': ['Warsaw', 'Lyon', 'Naples', 'Reykjavik', 'Helsinki', 'Split'],\n            'Helsinki': ['Naples', 'Reykjavik', 'Split'],\n            'Reykjavik': ['Brussels'],\n            'Brussels': ['Lyon', 'Valencia'],\n            'Naples': ['Valencia', 'Split'],\n            'Valencia': ['Lyon'],\n            'Lyon': ['Split'],\n            'Split': [],\n            'Warsaw': ['Split', 'Valencia', 'Brussels']\n        }\n        self.itinerary = []\n        self.current_day = 1\n        self.current_city = 'Porto'\n\n    def plan_trip(self):\n        self.stay('Porto', 5)\n        self.visit_next_city()\n        return self.itinerary\n\n    def visit_next_city(self):\n        while self.current_day <= 27:\n            next_cities = self.flights[self.current_city]\n            for city in next_cities:\n                if city in self.cities and self.cities[city] > 0:\n                    self.fly_to(city)\n                    self.stay(city, self.cities[city])\n                    self.visit_next_city()\n                    break\n            else:\n                break\n\n    def stay(self, city, days):\n        self.itinerary.append({'day_range': f'Day {self.current_day}-{self.current_day + days - 1}', 'place': city})\n        self.current_day += days\n        self.cities[city] = 0\n\n    def fly_to(self, city):\n        self.itinerary.append({'flying': f'Day {self.current_day - 1}-{self.current_day - 1}', 'from': self.current_city, 'to': city})\n        self.current_city = city\n\nplanner = TripPlanner()\nitinerary = planner.plan_trip()\n\nfor i in range(len(itinerary)):\n    if 'flying' in itinerary[i]:\n        itinerary[i]['flying'] = f\"Day {itinerary[i]['flying'].split('-')[0]}-{itinerary[i]['flying'].split('-')[1]}\"\n\nprint(json.dumps(itinerary, indent=2))\n```",
