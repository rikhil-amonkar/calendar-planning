            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to plan this 13-day trip across 6 European cities with all the given constraints. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to list out all the cities and the number of days I plan to stay in each:\n\n- Dublin: 3 days\n- Madrid: 2 days\n- Oslo: 3 days\n- London: 2 days\n- Vilnius: 3 days\n- Berlin: 5 days\n\nNext, there are specific time windows for certain events:\n\n- In Dublin, I want to meet friends between day 7 and day 9.\n- In Madrid, I need to visit relatives between day 2 and day 3.\n- In Berlin, there's a wedding to attend between day 3 and day 7.\n\nI also have a list of direct flights between these cities. My goal is to create an itinerary that satisfies all these constraints and fits within the 13-day period.\n\nI'll start by scheduling the fixed events first because they have specific time frames. The earliest fixed event is in Madrid between day 2 and 3. So, I'll place Madrid at the beginning.\n\nAfter Madrid, the next fixed event is the wedding in Berlin, which starts on day 3. Since Berlin requires a 5-day stay, I'll allocate days 3 to 7 for Berlin. This way, the wedding is covered within that period.\n\nFollowing Berlin, the next fixed event is meeting friends in Dublin between day 7 and 9. Dublin needs 3 days, so I'll set Dublin from day 7 to 9.\n\nNow, I need to fill in the remaining days. After Dublin, I have days 10 to 13 left. I have Oslo, London, and Vilnius to visit, each requiring 3, 2, and 3 days respectively. That adds up to 8 days, but I only have 4 days left, which doesn't fit. I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recount the days. From day 1 to 13, I've allocated days 1-2 for Madrid, 3-7 for Berlin, and 7-9 for Dublin. That brings me to day 9. I have 4 days left (10-13). I need to fit in Oslo (3 days), London (2 days), and Vilnius (3 days). That's 8 days, which doesn't add up. I must adjust my allocations.\n\nPerhaps I can overlap some stays or adjust the order. Let me try starting with Berlin first, as it has the longest stay. If I start in Berlin from day 1 to 5, then go to Madrid for days 6-7, that might work. After Madrid, I can go to Dublin for days 8-10 to meet friends. Then, I have days 11-13 left, which can be used for Oslo (3 days). But then London and Vilnius wouldn't fit. This approach isn't working either.\n\nI think I need to prioritize the fixed events more carefully. The wedding in Berlin is from day 3 to 7, so I need to ensure I'm in Berlin during those days. Maybe I can start in Berlin, attend the wedding, and then move to other cities. Let's try:\n\n- Berlin: day 1 to 5 (5 days)\n- Then to Madrid: day 6-7 (2 days)\n- From Madrid to Dublin: day 8-10 (3 days)\n- Then to Oslo: day 11-13 (3 days)\n\nBut this leaves out London and Vilnius. I'm still short on days. Maybe I can adjust the order to include all cities without overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should start in Madrid, then go to Berlin, then Dublin, and fit in the other cities around these fixed points. Let me map it out:\n\n- Madrid: day 1-2 (2 days)\n- Fly to Berlin: day 3\n- Berlin: day 3-7 (5 days)\n- Fly to Dublin: day 8\n- Dublin: day 8-10 (3 days)\n- Fly to Oslo: day 11\n- Oslo: day 11-13 (3 days)\n\nThis way, I've covered Madrid, Berlin, Dublin, and Oslo within the 13 days. However, London and Vilnius are still left out. I need to find a way to include them without exceeding the 13-day limit.\n\nMaybe I can reduce the stay in Oslo or adjust the order to fit in London and Vilnius. Let's try:\n\n- Madrid: day 1-2\n- Berlin: day 3-7\n- Dublin: day 8-10\n- London: day 11-12\n- Vilnius: day 13\n\nBut Vilnius needs 3 days, and I only have day 13 left, which isn't enough. This isn't working.\n\nPerhaps I need to adjust the fixed events. The meeting in Dublin is between day 7-9, and the wedding in Berlin is day 3-7. Maybe I can overlap these events by visiting Dublin during the Berlin stay. But that might not be possible since I can't be in two places at once.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me try a different approach. I'll list all the cities with their required days and fixed events:\n\n1. Berlin: 5 days (including wedding day 3-7)\n2. Dublin: 3 days (meeting day 7-9)\n3. Madrid: 2 days (relatives day 2-3)\n4. Oslo: 3 days\n5. London: 2 days\n6. Vilnius: 3 days\n\nTotal days needed: 5 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 18 days, but I only have 13 days. This means I need to overlap some stays or adjust the durations, which isn't possible as per the constraints. There must be a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nWait, the total trip is 13 days, and the sum of the days in each city is 3+2+3+2+3+5 = 18, which exceeds 13 days. This indicates that some cities can't be visited for the full duration, or there's an error in the problem statement. But since the problem requires visiting all 6 cities, I must find a way to fit them into 13 days without exceeding the total.\n\nPerhaps some cities can be visited for fewer days than specified. However, the constraints specify the exact number of days to stay in each city, so reducing the days isn't an option. This suggests that the problem might have an inconsistency, but I'll proceed under the assumption that all cities must be visited for the specified durations within the 13-day period.\n\nGiven this, I'll prioritize the fixed events and try to fit the other cities around them:\n\n1. Madrid: day 1-2 (relatives day 2-3)\n2. Berlin: day 3-7 (wedding day 3-7)\n3. Dublin: day 8-10 (meeting day 7-9)\n4. Oslo: day 11-13 (3 days)\n\nThis leaves London and Vilnius out. To include them, I might need to adjust the stays:\n\n- Madrid: day 1-2\n- Berlin: day 3-7\n- Dublin: day 8-10\n- London: day 11-12\n- Vilnius: day 13\n- Oslo: day 14-16 (but this exceeds the 13-day limit)\n\nThis still doesn't fit. I'm realizing that it's impossible to visit all six cities for the specified durations within 13 days. There must be a miscalculation or an alternative approach.\n\nPerhaps I can adjust the order to minimize travel days and overlap some stays. Let me try:\n\n- Start in Berlin: day 1-5\n- Fly to Madrid: day 6\n- Madrid: day 6-7\n- Fly to Dublin: day 8\n- Dublin: day 8-10\n- Fly to Oslo: day 11\n- Oslo: day 11-13\n\nThis way, I've included Berlin, Madrid, Dublin, and Oslo, but still missing London and Vilnius. I need to find a way to include them without adding extra days.\n\nMaybe I can visit London and Vilnius for shorter periods, but the constraints specify the exact number of days. This seems unmanageable. I might need to revisit the flight connections to see if there's a more efficient route.\n\nLooking at the flight connections, I can travel from Berlin to London directly. So, after Berlin, I can go to London for 2 days, then to Dublin, Oslo, and Vilnius. Let's try:\n\n- Berlin: day 1-5\n- Fly to London: day 6\n- London: day 6-7\n- Fly to Dublin: day 8\n- Dublin: day 8-10\n- Fly to Oslo: day 11\n- Oslo: day 11-13\n\nThis includes Berlin, London, Dublin, and Oslo, but still missing Madrid and Vilnius. I'm back to the same issue.\n\nI think the key here is that the total required days exceed the available days, making it impossible to visit all cities as specified. However, since the problem requires a solution, I'll proceed by adjusting the durations or assuming some flexibility in the fixed events.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce the stay in Berlin to 4 days instead of 5, but the problem states exactly 5 days. Alternatively, I can adjust the meeting in Dublin to overlap with the Berlin stay, but that's not feasible.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll have to prioritize and possibly leave out some cities or reduce their stay, even though it's not ideal. For the sake of providing an itinerary, I'll focus on the fixed events and include as many cities as possible within the 13 days.\n\nFinal attempt:\n\n- Madrid: day 1-2\n- Berlin: day 3-7\n- Dublin: day 8-10\n- Oslo: day 11-13\n\nThis includes four cities, but I'm still missing London and Vilnius. It seems unavoidable given the time constraints.\n\nI think the problem might have an error in the total days or the number of cities to visit. However, I'll proceed to create an itinerary based on the fixed events and include the remaining cities where possible.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef calculate_itinerary():\n    # Define the cities and their required durations\n    cities = {\n        'Dublin': 3,\n        'Madrid': 2,\n        'Oslo': 3,\n        'London': 2,\n        'Vilnius': 3,\n        'Berlin': 5\n    }\n\n    # Define fixed events with specific day ranges\n    fixed_events = {\n        'Madrid': (2, 3),\n        'Berlin': (3, 7),\n        'Dublin': (7, 9)\n    }\n\n    # Define flight connections\n    flight_connections = {\n        'London': ['Madrid', 'Oslo', 'Berlin', 'Dublin'],\n        'Madrid': ['Oslo', 'Dublin', 'London', 'Berlin'],\n        'Oslo': ['Vilnius', 'Madrid', 'London', 'Dublin', 'Berlin'],\n        'Dublin': ['Oslo', 'London', 'Madrid', 'Berlin'],\n        'Vilnius': ['Oslo', 'Berlin'],\n        'Berlin': ['Vilnius', 'Oslo', 'Madrid', 'Dublin', 'London']\n    }\n\n    # Initialize itinerary\n    itinerary = []\n    current_day = 1\n    remaining_cities = {city: days for city, days in cities.items() if city not in fixed_events}\n\n    # Place fixed events first\n    sorted_fixed_events = sorted(fixed_events.items(), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n    for city, (start, end) in sorted_fixed_events:\n        itinerary.append({'day_range': f'Day {start}-{end}', 'place': city})\n        current_day = end + 1\n\n    # Fill remaining days with other cities\n    for city in remaining_cities:\n        if current_day > 13:\n            break\n        days_available = min(remaining_cities[city], 14 - current_day)\n        if days_available <= 0:\n            continue\n        itinerary.append({'day_range': f'Day {current_day}-{current_day + days_available - 1}', 'place': city})\n        current_day += days_available\n\n    return itinerary\n\n# Generate flight segments\nitinerary = calculate_itinerary()\nflight_segments = []\nfor i in range(len(itinerary)):\n    if i == 0:\n        prev_place = None\n    else:\n        prev_place = itinerary[i-1]['place']\n    current_place = itinerary[i]['place']\n    if prev_place is not None and prev_place != current_place:\n        flight_segments.append({\n            'flying': f'Day {itinerary[i][\"day_range\"].split(\"-\")[0]}',\n            'from': prev_place,\n            'to': current_place\n        })\n\n# Combine day ranges and flight segments\nfinal_itinerary = []\nfor segment in flight_segments:\n    final_itinerary.append(segment)\n\nfor day_range in itinerary:\n    final_itinerary.append(day_range)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(json.dumps(final_itinerary, indent=2))\n```",
