            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to write a Python program that calculates an optimal travel itinerary based on a set of constraints. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input parameters carefully. The user wants to visit 8 European cities over 18 days. They have specific stays in each city and certain events they need to attend. The cities are Mykonos, Krakow, Vilnius, Helsinki, Dubrovnik, Oslo, Madrid, and Paris. Each city has a specified number of days to stay, and some have events tied to specific date ranges.\n\nNext, I need to consider the direct flights between these cities. The user provided a list of direct flight connections. This will be crucial in determining the possible paths between cities.\n\nMy goal is to create a program that takes these constraints and flight connections and computes the optimal itinerary. The output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with day ranges for each city and flight transitions.\n\nI'll start by defining the cities and their durations, as well as the direct flights. Then, I'll create a class `TripPlanner` to manage the itinerary. The `plan_trip` method will handle the sequencing of cities based on constraints.\n\nI realize that the constraints include specific date ranges for events, so I need to ensure that the itinerary aligns with these. For example, the user must be in Dubrovnik from day 2 to day 4 for the annual show and in Mykonos from day 15 to day 18 to visit relatives.\n\nI'll start the trip in Oslo since the user wants to meet friends there between day 1 and day 2. From Oslo, I'll look for a direct flight to Dubrovnik to attend the show. After Dubrovnik, I'll head to Helsinki, as there's a direct flight and it fits the timeline.\n\nFrom Helsinki, I'll go to Krakow, which has a direct flight and allows the user to spend 5 days there. Next, I'll fly to Paris, as it's a direct flight from Krakow and fits the schedule. After Paris, Madrid is the logical next step, with a direct flight and a 5-day stay.\n\nFrom Madrid, I'll fly to Mykonos to visit relatives, ensuring the stay covers days 15 to 18. Finally, I'll return to Oslo for the remaining days.\n\nThroughout this process, I'll make sure each transition happens on the same day, updating the current day count accordingly. The `add_place` and `add_flight` methods will handle appending the city stays and flight details to the itinerary.\n\nI'll test the program to ensure it runs independently and outputs valid JSON without any additional text. This way, the user can execute it directly and get the desired itinerary.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nclass TripPlanner:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.cities = {\n            'Mykonos': 4,\n            'Krakow': 5,\n            'Vilnius': 2,\n            'Helsinki': 2,\n            'Dubrovnik': 3,\n            'Oslo': 2,\n            'Madrid': 5,\n            'Paris': 2\n        }\n        self.direct_flights = {\n            'Oslo': ['Krakow', 'Paris', 'Madrid', 'Helsinki', 'Dubrovnik', 'Vilnius'],\n            'Krakow': ['Paris', 'Vilnius'],\n            'Vilnius': ['Paris'],\n            'Helsinki': ['Krakow', 'Paris', 'Madrid'],\n            'Dubrovnik': ['Helsinki', 'Madrid'],\n            'Madrid': ['Mykonos'],\n            'Paris': ['Madrid']\n        }\n        self.itinerary = []\n        self.current_day = 1\n\n    def plan_trip(self):\n        # Start with Oslo to meet friends\n        self.add_place('Oslo', 2)\n        # Fly to Dubrovnik for the annual show\n        self.add_flight('Oslo', 'Dubrovnik')\n        self.add_place('Dubrovnik', 3)\n        # Fly to Helsinki\n        self.add_flight('Dubrovnik', 'Helsinki')\n        self.add_place('Helsinki', 2)\n        # Fly to Krakow\n        self.add_flight('Helsinki', 'Krakow')\n        self.add_place('Krakow', 5)\n        # Fly to Paris\n        self.add_flight('Krakow', 'Paris')\n        self.add_place('Paris', 2)\n        # Fly to Madrid\n        self.add_flight('Paris', 'Madrid')\n        self.add_place('Madrid', 5)\n        # Fly to Mykonos to visit relatives\n        self.add_flight('Madrid', 'Mykonos')\n        self.add_place('Mykonos', 4)\n        # Return to Oslo\n        self.add_flight('Mykonos', 'Oslo')\n        self.add_place('Oslo', 2)\n\n    def add_place(self, place, days):\n        end_day = self.current_day + days - 1\n        self.itinerary.append({'day_range': f'Day {self.current_day}-{end_day}', 'place': place})\n        self.current_day = end_day + 1\n\n    def add_flight(self, from_city, to_city):\n        self.itinerary.append({'flying': f'Day {self.current_day}-{self.current_day}', 'from': from_city, 'to': to_city})\n        self.current_day += 1\n\nplanner = TripPlanner()\nplanner.plan_trip()\nprint(json.dumps(planner.itinerary))\n```",
