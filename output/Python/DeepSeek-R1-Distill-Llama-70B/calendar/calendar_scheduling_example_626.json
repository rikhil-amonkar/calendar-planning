            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this meeting scheduling problem step by step. So, we need to find a suitable time for Patricia and Jesse to have a one-hour meeting either on Monday or Tuesday, considering their busy schedules.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the constraints:\n\n1. **Meeting Duration**: 1 hour (60 minutes)\n2. **Work Hours**: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM (converted to minutes, that's 540 to 1020 minutes)\n3. **Days Available**: Monday or Tuesday\n\nNow, let's look at their schedules:\n\n- **Patricia's Schedule**:\n  - Monday: Busy from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM, 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n  - Tuesday: Busy from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\n- **Jesse's Schedule**:\n  - Monday: Completely blocked all day.\n  - Tuesday: Busy from 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM, 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nGiven these schedules, the first observation is that **Monday is out of the question for Jesse** since he's completely unavailable. So, we only need to consider **Tuesday**.\n\nNext, let's list out all the busy intervals for both Patricia and Jesse on Tuesday:\n\n- **Patricia on Tuesday**:\n  - 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM\n  - 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM\n  - 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM\n  - 4:30 PM - 5:00 PM\n\n- **Jesse on Tuesday**:\n  - 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM\n  - 12:00 PM - 12:30 PM\n  - 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM\n  - 2:30 PM - 3:00 PM\n  - 3:30 PM - 5:00 PM\n\nNow, let's combine these intervals to find all the times when **either** Patricia **or** Jesse is busy on Tuesday:\n\n1. 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM (Patricia)\n2. 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM (Patricia)\n3. 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM (Jesse)\n4. 12:00 PM - 12:30 PM (Jesse)\n5. 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM (Jesse)\n6. 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM (Patricia)\n7. 2:30 PM - 3:00 PM (Jesse)\n8. 3:30 PM - 5:00 PM (Jesse)\n9. 4:30 PM - 5:00 PM (Patricia)\n\nNow, let's visualize the entire day with these intervals marked:\n\n```\n9:00 AM - 10:00 AM: Free\n10:00 AM - 10:30 AM: Busy (Patricia)\n10:30 AM - 11:00 AM: Free\n11:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Busy (Patricia)\n12:00 PM - 12:30 PM: Busy (Jesse)\n12:30 PM - 1:00 PM: Free\n1:00 PM - 2:00 PM: Busy (Jesse)\n2:00 PM - 4:00 PM: Busy (Patricia)\n4:00 PM - 4:30 PM: Free\n4:30 PM - 5:00 PM: Busy (Patricia)\n```\n\nFrom this visualization, the **free slots** where both Patricia and Jesse are available are:\n\n1. **9:00 AM - 10:00 AM**\n2. **10:30 AM - 11:00 AM**\n3. **12:30 PM - 1:00 PM**\n4. **4:00 PM - 4:30 PM**\n\nNow, considering the meeting duration of 1 hour, let's check these slots:\n\n1. **9:00 AM - 10:00 AM**: Fits a 1-hour meeting.\n2. **10:30 AM - 11:00 AM**: Only 30 minutes available. Not enough.\n3. **12:30 PM - 1:00 PM**: Only 30 minutes available. Not enough.\n4. **4:00 PM - 4:30 PM**: Only 30 minutes available. Not enough.\n\nSo, the only viable option is **9:00 AM - 10:00 AM** on Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to ensure there's no overlap or error in the intervals.\n\n- **9:00 AM - 10:00 AM**:\n  - Patricia: Not busy during this time.\n  - Jesse: Not busy during this time.\n\nYes, this slot works perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the proposed meeting time is **9:00 AM - 10:00 AM on Tuesday**.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes and meeting duration\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n    duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    # Define busy intervals for each participant in minutes\n    patricia_busy = {\n        \"Monday\": [[10*60, 10*60+30], [11*60+30, 12*60], [13*60, 13*60+30], [14*60+30, 15*60+30], [16*60, 16*60+30]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[10*60, 10*60+30], [11*60, 12*60], [14*60, 16*60], [16*60+30, 17*60]]\n    }\n\n    jesse_busy = {\n        \"Monday\": [[9*60, 17*60]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[11*60, 11*60+30], [12*60, 12*60+30], [13*60, 14*60], [14*60+30, 15*60], [15*60+30, 17*60]]\n    }\n\n    # Days to check\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\"]\n\n    # Iterate through each day\n    for day in days:\n        # Get busy intervals for the current day\n        patricia_busy_times = patricia_busy.get(day, [])\n        jesse_busy_times = jesse_busy.get(day, [])\n\n        # Combine busy intervals\n        all_busy = patricia_busy_times + jesse_busy_times\n\n        # Sort busy intervals by start time\n        all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n        # Check each possible time slot\n        for time in range(work_start, work_end - duration + 1):\n            current_time = time\n            end_slot = time + duration\n\n            # Check availability for both participants\n            available = True\n            for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n                if not (end_slot <= busy_start or current_time >= busy_end):\n                    available = False\n                    break\n\n            if available:\n                # Convert time to HH:MM format\n                start_hour = current_time // 60\n                start_minute = current_time % 60\n                end_hour = end_slot // 60\n                end_minute = end_slot % 60\n\n                return f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per the problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
