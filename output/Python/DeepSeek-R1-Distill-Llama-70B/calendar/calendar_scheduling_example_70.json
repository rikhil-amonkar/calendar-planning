So, we need to find a time for Denise, Angela, and Natalie to meet for half an hour on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. \n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's availability:\n\n- **Denise** is busy from 12:00 to 12:30 and 15:30 to 16:00.\n- **Angela** has no meetings all day, so she's free anytime.\n- **Natalie** is busy from 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 17:00.\n\nSince Angela is available all day, we only need to consider Denise and Natalie's schedules.\n\nOur goal is to find the earliest possible time that works for everyone. Let's map out the busy times:\n\n1. **9:00 to 11:30**: Natalie is busy.\n2. **12:00 to 12:30**: Both Denise and Natalie are busy.\n3. **12:30 to 13:00**: Natalie is free, but Denise is busy until 12:30. So, from 12:30 onwards, Denise is free, but Natalie becomes busy again at 13:00.\n4. **13:00 to 14:00**: Natalie is busy until 14:00.\n5. **14:00 to 14:30**: Natalie is busy again.\n6. **14:30 to 15:00**: Natalie is free, and Denise is free too.\n7. **15:00 to 15:30**: Natalie is busy, but Denise is free until 15:30.\n8. **15:30 to 16:00**: Denise is busy.\n9. **16:00 to 17:00**: Natalie is busy, but Denise is free after 16:00.\n\nLooking at the gaps:\n\n- Between 13:00 and 14:00, Natalie is busy, so that's not an option.\n- From 14:30 to 15:00, both Denise and Natalie are free. That's a 30-minute window, which fits our meeting duration perfectly.\n\nSo, the earliest available time that works for everyone is 14:30 to 15:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the busy intervals for Denise, Angela, and Natalie in minutes since midnight\n    denise_busy = [(12, 0, 12, 30), (15, 30, 16, 0)]\n    angela_busy = []\n    natalie_busy = [(9, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 13, 0), (14, 0, 14, 30), (15, 0, 17, 0)]\n\n    day = \"Monday\"\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes in minutes\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    all_busy = denise_busy + angela_busy + natalie_busy\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n    # Check for available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        start = busy_start[0] * 60 + busy_start[1]\n        end = busy_end[0] * 60 + busy_end[1]\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= start:\n            # Found a slot\n            meeting_start = current_time\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n        current_time = max(current_time, end)\n\n    # Check if there's time after the last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        meeting_start = current_time\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n        return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
