            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Eric, Ashley, Ronald, and Larry on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The meeting needs to be half an hour long. Let's see what each person's schedule looks like.\n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's availability:\n\n- **Eric**: He's free the entire day. That's great, so his availability is 9:00 to 17:00.\n- **Ashley**: She's busy from 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, and 15:00 to 16:00. So her free slots are:\n  - 9:00 to 10:00\n  - 10:30 to 11:00\n  - 13:00 to 15:00\n  - 16:00 to 17:00\n- **Ronald**: He's busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 17:00. His free slots are:\n  - 9:30 to 10:00\n  - 11:30 to 12:30\n  - 14:00 to 14:30\n- **Larry**: He's busy from 9:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 17:00. His only free slot is 12:00 to 13:00.\n\nNow, the goal is to find a 30-minute window where all four are available. Let's look for overlapping free times.\n\n1. **9:00 to 10:00**: Eric is free, Ashley is free until 10:00, but Ronald is busy until 9:30, and Larry is busy until 12:00. So, not everyone is free here.\n\n2. **10:30 to 11:00**: Ashley is free, Eric is free, Ronald is busy until 11:30, and Larry is busy until 12:00. So, Ronald and Larry are not free.\n\n3. **11:30 to 12:30**: Ashley is busy until 12:00, so from 12:00 to 12:30, Ashley is free. Ronald is free here, Eric is free, and Larry is free from 12:00 to 13:00. This looks promising.\n\n4. **13:00 to 15:00**: Ashley is free, Eric is free, Ronald is busy until 14:00, and Larry is busy after 13:00. So, Ronald is busy until 14:00, so not everyone is free until then.\n\n5. **14:00 to 14:30**: Ronald is free, Ashley is free until 15:00, Eric is free, and Larry is busy after 13:00. So, from 14:00 to 14:30, everyone except Larry is free, but Larry is busy until 17:00.\n\n6. **16:00 to 17:00**: Ashley is free after 16:00, Eric is free, Ronald is busy after 14:30, and Larry is busy. So, Ronald and Larry are not free.\n\nLooking at these options, the only time slot where everyone is free is from 12:00 to 12:30. Let's double-check:\n\n- **Eric**: Free\n- **Ashley**: Free from 12:00 to 12:30 (her busy time ends at 12:00)\n- **Ronald**: Free from 11:30 to 12:30\n- **Larry**: Free from 12:00 to 13:00\n\nSo, the overlapping free time is from 12:00 to 12:30. That's a 30-minute window, perfect for the meeting.\n\nI think that's the best time that works for everyone.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9,\n        \"end\": 17\n    }\n\n    # Define participants' schedules\n    eric_schedule = []\n    ashley_schedule = [[10, 10.5], [11, 12], [12.5, 13], [15, 16]]\n    ronald_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [10, 11.5], [12.5, 14], [14.5, 17]]\n    larry_schedule = [[9, 12], [13, 17]]\n\n    # Combine all schedules\n    all_schedules = [\n        eric_schedule,\n        ashley_schedule,\n        ronald_schedule,\n        larry_schedule\n    ]\n\n    # Flatten and sort all busy intervals\n    all_busy = []\n    for schedule in all_schedules:\n        all_busy.extend(schedule)\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Initialize previous end time to work hours start\n    prev_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n\n    # Iterate through each busy interval\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        # Check for available slot before the busy interval starts\n        if busy_start - prev_end >= 0.5:  # 0.5 hours = 30 minutes\n            # Format the time slots\n            start_time = prev_end\n            end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n            # Convert to HH:MM format\n            start_hh = int(start_time)\n            start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n            end_hh = int(end_time)\n            end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n            # Return the earliest available time\n            return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n        \n        # Update previous end time\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, busy_end)\n\n    # Check for available slot after the last busy interval\n    if work_hours[\"end\"] - prev_end >= 0.5:\n        start_time = prev_end\n        end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n        start_hh = int(start_time)\n        start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n        end_hh = int(end_time)\n        end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n        return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
