The meeting should be half an hour long, between 9:00 and 17:00. \n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times:\n\n- **Patrick**: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 13:30-14:00, 16:00-16:30\n- **Kayla**: 12:30-13:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n- **Carl**: 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-17:00\n- **Christian**: 9:00-12:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-17:00\n\nI'll combine all these intervals and sort them to find any gaps where everyone is free.\n\nLet me merge and sort the intervals:\n\n1. 9:00-9:30 (Patrick)\n2. 10:00-10:30 (Patrick)\n3. 10:30-11:00 (Carl)\n4. 12:00-12:30 (Carl)\n5. 12:30-13:30 (Kayla)\n6. 13:00-13:30 (Carl)\n7. 13:00-14:00 (Christian)\n8. 13:30-14:00 (Patrick)\n9. 14:30-17:00 (Carl, Christian)\n10. 15:00-15:30 (Kayla)\n11. 16:00-16:30 (Patrick, Kayla)\n\nNow, I'll check for available slots:\n\n- **9:30-10:00**: Patrick is free, but Christian is busy until 12:30, so not suitable.\n- **10:30-11:00**: Carl is busy.\n- **11:00-12:00**: Everyone seems free except Christian, who is busy until 12:30.\n- **12:30-13:00**: Kayla is busy.\n- **13:30-14:00**: Patrick is busy.\n- **14:00-14:30**: Carl and Christian are busy from 14:30.\n- **15:30-16:00**: Kayla and Patrick are busy at 16:00.\n- **16:30-17:00**: All are busy.\n\nWait, I missed checking the gap between 11:00 and 12:00. Let me double-check:\n\n- From 11:00 to 12:00, Patrick is free, Kayla is free, Carl is free, but Christian is busy until 12:30. So, Christian is unavailable.\n\nSo, no slot there.\n\nNext available gap is between 14:00 and 14:30. But Carl and Christian are busy starting at 14:30, so 14:00-14:30 might be available.\n\nWait, Christian is busy until 14:00? No, Christian is busy from 13:00-14:00, so he's free at 14:00. Carl is busy from 14:30. So 14:00-14:30 is free for everyone.\n\nYes, that's the slot.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the busy intervals for Patrick, Kayla, Carl, and Christian in minutes since midnight\n    patrick_busy = [(9, 0, 9, 30), (10, 0, 10, 30), (13, 30, 14, 0), (16, 0, 16, 30)]\n    kayla_busy = [(12, 30, 13, 30), (15, 0, 15, 30), (16, 0, 16, 30)]\n    carl_busy = [(10, 30, 11, 0), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 13, 30), (14, 30, 17, 0)]\n    christian_busy = [(9, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 14, 0), (14, 30, 17, 0)]\n\n    day = \"Monday\"\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes in minutes\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    all_busy = patrick_busy + kayla_busy + carl_busy + christian_busy\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n    # Check for available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        start = busy_start[0] * 60 + busy_start[1]\n        end = busy_end[0] * 60 + busy_end[1]\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= start:\n            # Found a slot\n            meeting_start = current_time\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n        current_time = max(current_time, end)\n\n    # Check if there's time after the last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        meeting_start = current_time\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n        return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
