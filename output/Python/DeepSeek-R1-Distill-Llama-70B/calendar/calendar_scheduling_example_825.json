            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to find a time for Laura and Philip to meet. The meeting should be an hour long and happen between 9 AM and 5 PM, Monday to Thursday. Also, Philip can't meet on Wednesday.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each day and check both Laura's and Philip's availability, making sure they're both free at the same time.\n\nStarting with Monday. Laura is busy at several times: 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00. Philip is busy all day Monday, so they can't meet then.\n\nNext, Tuesday. Laura's busy times: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-17:00. Philip is busy until 11:00, then 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, and 15:00-16:30. Let me check the free slots.\n\nFrom 9:00 to 9:30: Laura is free, but Philip is busy until 9:00? Wait, Philip's schedule on Tuesday starts at 9:00-11:00, so he's busy until 11:00. So the earliest they can meet is after 11:00.\n\nLooking for a one-hour slot. Let's see:\n\nAfter 11:00, Laura is free until 11:00-11:30 is busy. So 11:30 onwards. But Philip is busy from 11:30-12:00. So next possible time is 12:00. Check if both are free from 12:00-13:00. Laura's next busy time is 13:00-13:30, so she's free until then. Philip is free from 12:00-13:00 as well? Wait, Philip's Tuesday schedule: 9:00-11:00, then 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-16:30. So from 12:00-13:00, he's free. Laura is free from 12:00-13:00 except her busy time starts at 13:00. So 12:00-13:00 is a possible slot. But wait, the meeting needs to be an hour. So 12:00-13:00 is exactly one hour. That works. So Tuesday at 12:00-13:00 is a possible time.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Laura's Tuesday schedule: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, etc. So at 12:00, she's free. Philip is free from 12:00-13:00. So yes, that slot works.\n\nAlternatively, let's check other days just in case. On Wednesday, Philip can't meet, so we skip that. Thursday: Laura is busy at 10:30-11:00, 12:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30. Philip on Thursday is busy until 10:30, then 11:00-12:30, 13:00-17:00. So possible slots on Thursday would be after 12:30, but Laura is busy from 12:00-13:30, so maybe 13:30-14:30? Let me check.\n\nLaura's Thursday: free from 9:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 13:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. Philip is free on Thursday from 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, and then busy until 17:00. So possible times:\n\nLooking for an hour. 10:30-11:30: Laura is free from 10:30-11:00, but busy from 11:00-12:00. So 10:30-11:30 wouldn't work because Laura is busy at 11:00. Next, 12:30-13:30: Laura is busy until 13:30, so 12:30-13:30 would overlap with her 12:00-13:30 busy time. So no. 13:30-14:30: Laura is free from 13:30-15:00, Philip is busy from 13:00 onwards. So no. So Thursday might not have a slot, but Tuesday does.\n\nSo the solution is Tuesday at 12:00-13:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"Monday\": (9, 17),\n        \"Tuesday\": (9, 17),\n        \"Wednesday\": (9, 17),\n        \"Thursday\": (9, 17)\n    }\n\n    # Define busy intervals for Laura and Philip\n    laura_busy = {\n        \"Monday\": [(10, 30), (11, 0), (12, 30), (13, 0), (14, 30), (15, 30), (16, 0), (17, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 30), (10, 0), (11, 0), (11, 30), (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 30), (15, 0), (16, 0), (17, 0)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(11, 30), (12, 0), (12, 30), (13, 0), (15, 30), (16, 30)],\n        \"Thursday\": [(10, 30), (11, 0), (12, 0), (13, 30), (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30)]\n    }\n\n    philip_busy = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 0), (17, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0), (11, 0), (11, 30), (12, 0), (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30), (15, 0), (16, 30)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0), (12, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30), (17, 0)],\n        \"Thursday\": [(9, 0), (10, 30), (11, 0), (12, 30), (13, 0), (17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    # Philip cannot meet on Wednesday\n    days_to_check = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Thursday\"]\n\n    for day in days_to_check:\n        start_hour, end_hour = work_hours[day]\n        laura_free = []\n        current = start_hour\n        for busy_start, busy_end in laura_busy[day]:\n            if busy_start > current:\n                laura_free.append((current, busy_start))\n            current = max(current, busy_end)\n        if current < end_hour:\n            laura_free.append((current, end_hour))\n\n        philip_free = []\n        current = start_hour\n        for busy_start, busy_end in philip_busy[day]:\n            if busy_start > current:\n                philip_free.append((current, busy_start))\n            current = max(current, busy_end)\n        if current < end_hour:\n            philip_free.append((current, end_hour))\n\n        common_free = []\n        for lf_start, lf_end in laura_free:\n            for pf_start, pf_end in philip_free:\n                overlap_start = max(lf_start, pf_start)\n                overlap_end = min(lf_end, pf_end)\n                if overlap_start < overlap_end:\n                    common_free.append((overlap_start, overlap_end))\n\n        for slot in common_free:\n            start, end = slot\n            if end - start >= 1:\n                return f\"{day} {start:02d}:{start:02d}-{end:02d}:{end:02d}\"\n\n    return \"No common free time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
