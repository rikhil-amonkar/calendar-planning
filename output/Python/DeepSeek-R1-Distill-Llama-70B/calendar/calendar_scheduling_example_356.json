            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to find a suitable time for a meeting involving Katherine, Rebecca, Julie, Angela, Nicholas, and Carl on Monday. The meeting should be half an hour long between 9:00 and 17:00. \n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times:\n\n- **Katherine**: 12:00-12:30, 13:00-14:30\n- **Rebecca**: No meetings all day\n- **Julie**: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30\n- **Angela**: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00\n- **Nicholas**: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-13:30, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n- **Carl**: 9:00-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-14:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n\nAngela prefers not to have meetings before 15:00, so we need to focus on times after 15:00.\n\nNext, I'll combine all these schedules to find overlapping free slots. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. **9:00-10:00**: Angela is busy.\n2. **10:00-10:30**: Julie and Carl are free, but Angela is busy until 10:00.\n3. **10:30-11:00**: Julie and Carl are busy.\n4. **11:00-11:30**: Most are free except Nicholas and Carl.\n5. **11:30-12:00**: Nicholas and Carl are busy.\n6. **12:00-12:30**: Katherine is busy.\n7. **12:30-13:00**: Free for most except Carl.\n8. **13:00-13:30**: Katherine, Julie, Carl are busy.\n9. **13:30-14:00**: Julie is busy.\n10. **14:00-14:30**: Katherine, Carl are busy.\n11. **14:30-15:00**: Angela is busy.\n12. **15:00-15:30**: Julie is busy.\n13. **15:30-16:00**: Free for everyone except Carl until 16:00.\n14. **16:00-16:30**: Free for all.\n15. **16:30-17:00**: Angela, Nicholas, Carl are busy.\n\nConsidering Angela's preference, the earliest available time after 15:00 is 15:30-16:00. But wait, Carl is busy until 16:00. So the next available slot is 16:00-16:30, but Angela is busy at 16:30. Therefore, the best time is 15:30-16:00, but since Carl is busy until 16:00, the meeting can't start at 15:30. \n\nRe-evaluating, the next possible time is 16:00-16:30. At 16:00, Carl is free, and everyone else is available except Angela and Nicholas at 16:30. So the meeting can be scheduled from 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nFinally, I'll write the Python code to implement this logic, ensuring it checks each participant's schedule and respects Angela's preference.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9,\n        \"end\": 17\n    }\n\n    # Define participants' schedules\n    katherine_schedule = [[12, 12.5], [13, 14.5]]\n    rebecca_schedule = []\n    julie_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [10.5, 11], [13.5, 14], [15, 15.5]]\n    angela_schedule = [[9, 10], [10.5, 11], [11.5, 14], [14.5, 15], [16.5, 17]]\n    nicholas_schedule = [[9.5, 11], [11.5, 13.5], [14, 16], [16.5, 17]]\n    carl_schedule = [[9, 11], [11.5, 12.5], [13, 14.5], [15, 16], [16.5, 17]]\n\n    # Combine all schedules\n    all_schedules = [\n        katherine_schedule,\n        rebecca_schedule,\n        julie_schedule,\n        angela_schedule,\n        nicholas_schedule,\n        carl_schedule\n    ]\n\n    # Flatten and sort all busy intervals\n    all_busy = []\n    for schedule in all_schedules:\n        all_busy.extend(schedule)\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Initialize previous end time to work hours start\n    prev_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n\n    # Angela's preference: avoid meetings before 15:00\n    angela_preference = 15\n\n    # Apply Angela's preference\n    if prev_end < angela_preference:\n        prev_end = angela_preference\n\n    # Iterate through each busy interval\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        # Check for available slot before the busy interval starts\n        if busy_start - prev_end >= 0.5:  # 0.5 hours = 30 minutes\n            # Format the time slots\n            start_time = prev_end\n            end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n            # Convert to HH:MM format\n            start_hh = int(start_time)\n            start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n            end_hh = int(end_time)\n            end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n            # Return the earliest available time\n            return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n        \n        # Update previous end time\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, busy_end)\n\n    # Check for available slot after the last busy interval\n    if work_hours[\"end\"] - prev_end >= 0.5:\n        start_time = prev_end\n        end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n        start_hh = int(start_time)\n        start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n        end_hh = int(end_time)\n        end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n        return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
