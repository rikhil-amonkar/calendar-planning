            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to figure out how to schedule a meeting between Russell and Alexander based on their availability and preferences. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the meeting needs to be one hour long and must take place between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on either Monday or Tuesday. Russell prefers not to meet on Tuesday before 13:30, so I should prioritize Monday first if possible.\n\nLooking at Russell's schedule:\n- On Monday, he's busy from 10:30 to 11:00.\n- On Tuesday, he's busy from 13:00 to 13:30.\n\nAlexander's schedule:\n- On Monday, he has meetings from 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 17:00.\n- On Tuesday, he's busy from 9:00 to 10:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nI need to find a one-hour slot where both are free. Since Russell prefers not to meet on Tuesday before 13:30, I'll check Monday first.\n\nOn Monday:\n- Russell is free from 9:00 to 10:30, but Alexander is busy until 11:30.\n- After 11:30, Russell is free until his next meeting at 10:30, but Alexander is busy from 12:00 to 14:30.\n- The next available slot after 14:30 is from 14:30 to 15:00, but Alexander is busy from 15:00 onwards.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nRussell's Monday availability:\n- 9:00 to 10:30 (busy from 10:30 to 11:00)\n- 11:00 to 17:00, except 10:30 to 11:00.\n\nAlexander's Monday availability:\n- Busy from 9:00 to 11:30.\n- Free from 11:30 to 12:00.\n- Busy from 12:00 to 14:30.\n- Free from 14:30 to 15:00.\n- Busy from 15:00 to 17:00.\n\nSo, the overlapping free time on Monday is from 11:30 to 12:00, which is only 30 minutes. Not enough for a one-hour meeting.\n\nNext, let's check Tuesday, keeping in mind Russell's preference to avoid meetings before 13:30.\n\nRussell's Tuesday availability:\n- 9:00 to 13:00 (busy from 13:00 to 13:30)\n- 13:30 to 17:00.\n\nAlexander's Tuesday availability:\n- Busy from 9:00 to 10:00.\n- Free from 10:00 to 13:00.\n- Busy from 13:00 to 14:00.\n- Free from 14:00 to 15:00 (busy from 15:00 to 15:30)\n- Busy from 15:30 to 16:30.\n- Free from 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nSo, the overlapping free time on Tuesday after 13:30 is from 14:00 to 15:00. That's a perfect one-hour slot.\n\nTherefore, the meeting can be scheduled on Tuesday from 14:00 to 15:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    russell_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(10.5*60, 11*60)],\n        'Tuesday': [(13*60, 13.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    alexander_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 11.5*60), (12*60, 14.5*60), (15*60, 17*60)],\n        'Tuesday': [(9*60, 10*60), (13*60, 14*60), (15*60, 15.5*60), (16*60, 16.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday']\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 60  # 60 minutes\n\n    for day in days:\n        # Get busy intervals for both participants on the current day\n        russell_busy = russell_schedule.get(day, [])\n        alexander_busy = alexander_schedule.get(day, [])\n\n        # Combine and sort all busy intervals\n        all_busy = []\n        for interval in russell_busy:\n            all_busy.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Russell'))\n        for interval in alexander_busy:\n            all_busy.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Alexander'))\n\n        all_busy.sort()\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        current_time = start_time\n        for busy_start, busy_end, person in all_busy:\n            if current_time < busy_start:\n                # Found an available slot\n                if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                    # Format the time\n                    start_h = current_time // 60\n                    start_m = current_time % 60\n                    end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                    end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n                    \n                    # Convert to HH:MM format\n                    start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                    end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n                    \n                    print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                    return\n            current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n        # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            start_h = current_time // 60\n            start_m = current_time % 60\n            end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n            end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n            \n            start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n            end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n            \n            print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n            return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
