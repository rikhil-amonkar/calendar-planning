The meeting should be half an hour long, and they prefer the earliest available time.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each person's schedule:\n\n- Andrew and Grace have no meetings, so they're available all day.\n- Samuel has several blocked times:\n  - 9:00 to 10:30\n  - 11:30 to 12:00\n  - 13:00 to 13:30\n  - 14:00 to 16:00\n  - 16:30 to 17:00\n\nSince Andrew and Grace are free all day, the only constraints come from Samuel's blocked times. I need to find the earliest slot where Samuel is available.\n\nLet's list Samuel's available slots by looking at the gaps between his blocked times:\n\n1. After 10:30 to 11:30\n2. After 12:00 to 13:00\n3. After 13:30 to 14:00\n4. After 16:00 to 16:30\n\nNow, I'll check each of these slots to see if there's a 30-minute window:\n\n1. 10:30 to 11:30: This is a 60-minute slot. The earliest meeting could start at 10:30.\n2. 12:00 to 13:00: Another 60-minute slot. Meeting could start at 12:00.\n3. 13:30 to 14:00: Only 30 minutes, but it fits exactly.\n4. 16:00 to 16:30: Also 30 minutes.\n\nSince they want the earliest possible time, the first available slot is from 10:30 to 11:00.\n\nI'll write a Python script to represent this. The script will define each person's schedule, identify the available slots, and select the earliest one that fits the meeting duration.\n\nI'll make sure the script is clean and well-formatted, as per the user's instructions. It should output the time range and the day of the week.\n\nI'll structure the script by defining each person's blocked times, then merge and sort these intervals. After that, I'll look for gaps where the meeting can fit, starting from the earliest time.\n\nFinally, I'll test the script to ensure it correctly identifies the earliest available slot and outputs it in the required format.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    andrew_schedule = {\n        'Monday': []\n    }\n\n    grace_schedule = {\n        'Monday': []\n    }\n\n    samuel_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 10.5*60), (11.5*60, 12*60), \n                   (13*60, 13.5*60), (14*60, 16*60), \n                   (16.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    day = 'Monday'\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    busy_intervals = []\n    for interval in samuel_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Samuel'))\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    busy_intervals.sort()\n\n    # Find available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end, person in busy_intervals:\n        if current_time < busy_start:\n            if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                # Found a suitable time\n                start_h = current_time // 60\n                start_m = current_time % 60\n                end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n                print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                return\n        current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n    # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        start_h = current_time // 60\n        start_m = current_time % 60\n        end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n        end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n        print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n        return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
