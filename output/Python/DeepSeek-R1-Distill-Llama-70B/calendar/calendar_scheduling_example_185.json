            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to schedule a meeting for Kimberly, Megan, Marie, and Diana on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The meeting should be half an hour long. Let me look at each person's schedule and see where there's a common free slot.\n\nFirst, Kimberly has meetings from 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, and 16:00 to 16:30. So she's busy during those times.\n\nMegan is free all day, which is great, but she prefers not to have meetings before 10:00. So I should avoid scheduling the meeting before 10:00 if possible.\n\nMarie is busy from 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30. That leaves some gaps in her schedule.\n\nDiana is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:30, and 15:30 to 17:00. So she's free between 14:30 and 15:30, and maybe some other times.\n\nNow, let's map out the available slots for each person:\n\n- From 9:00 to 9:30: Only Diana is busy until 9:30, but Megan prefers after 10:00, so this slot might not work.\n- From 10:00 to 10:30: Kimberly is busy, so that's out.\n- From 10:30 to 11:00: Kimberly is free, Megan is available, Marie is busy until 11:00, and Diana is busy until 10:30. So maybe from 10:30 to 11:00, but Marie is busy until 11:00, so that might not work.\n- From 11:00 to 11:30: Kimberly is busy until 12:00, so that's out.\n- From 11:30 to 12:00: Kimberly is busy, Marie is busy until 11:30, so maybe from 11:30 to 12:00? But Kimberly is busy, so no.\n- From 12:00 to 16:00: Let's see. Kimberly is free from 12:00 to 16:00 except for her meeting at 16:00. Megan is free. Marie is busy until 15:00, so from 15:00 to 16:00 might be possible. Diana is busy until 14:30 and then from 15:30 to 17:00. So from 14:30 to 15:30, Diana is free, Marie is busy until 15:00, so maybe from 15:00 to 15:30? But Diana is busy from 15:30 onwards. Wait, Diana is busy from 15:30 to 17:00, so she's free until 15:30.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a time after 15:00 when most people are free. Let's see:\n\nFrom 15:00 to 15:30: Kimberly is free, Megan is available, Marie is busy until 15:00, so she might be free after that, and Diana is free until 15:30. So that could work.\n\nWait, Marie is busy until 15:00, so she's free from 15:00 onwards. Diana is busy from 15:30, so she's free until 15:30. Kimberly is free, and Megan is available. So 15:00 to 15:30 seems like a good slot.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Kimberly: Free from 12:00 to 16:00, except her meetings. So 15:00 to 15:30 is fine.\n- Megan: Available, and it's after 10:00, so she's okay with it.\n- Marie: Busy until 15:00, so 15:00 to 15:30 works.\n- Diana: Free until 15:30, so 15:00 to 15:30 is good.\n\nYes, that seems to work for everyone.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Define the work hours and meeting duration\nwork_start = \"09:00\"\nwork_end = \"17:00\"\nmeeting_duration = 30  # in minutes\n\n# Define participants' schedules and preferences\nparticipants = {\n    \"Kimberly\": [(\"10:00\", \"10:30\"), (\"11:00\", \"12:00\"), (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")],\n    \"Megan\": [],\n    \"Marie\": [(\"10:00\", \"11:00\"), (\"11:30\", \"15:00\"), (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")],\n    \"Diana\": [(\"09:30\", \"10:00\"), (\"10:30\", \"14:30\"), (\"15:30\", \"17:00\")]\n}\n\n# Megan's preference to avoid meetings before 10:00\nmegan_preference = \"10:00\"\n\n# Convert time strings to minutes since midnight for easier calculations\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n# Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    minutes = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n# Find the earliest available time slot that fits all constraints\nwork_start_minutes = time_to_minutes(work_start)\nwork_end_minutes = time_to_minutes(work_end)\nmeeting_end_minutes = work_start_minutes + meeting_duration\n\n# Initialize available time as the entire work day\navailable_start = work_start_minutes\navailable_end = work_end_minutes\n\n# Apply Megan's preference\npreference_minutes = time_to_minutes(megan_preference)\navailable_start = max(available_start, preference_minutes)\n\n# Check each participant's schedule to find common free time\nfor name, schedule in participants.items():\n    # Sort the schedule by start time\n    sorted_schedule = sorted(schedule, key=lambda x: time_to_minutes(x[0]))\n    \n    # Initialize with the work start time\n    current_start = work_start_minutes\n    \n    for slot in sorted_schedule:\n        slot_start = time_to_minutes(slot[0])\n        slot_end = time_to_minutes(slot[1])\n        \n        # If the slot starts after the current available start, update the available start\n        if slot_start > current_start:\n            current_start = max(current_start, slot_end)\n    \n    # Update the overall available time\n    available_start = max(available_start, current_start)\n\n# Ensure the meeting time is within work hours\nif available_start + meeting_duration > work_end_minutes:\n    print(\"No available time slot found within constraints.\")\nelse:\n    meeting_start = available_start\n    meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n    print(f\"Proposed meeting time: {minutes_to_time(meeting_start)}:{minutes_to_time(meeting_end)} on Monday\")\n```",
