            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to find a suitable time for a meeting between Natalie and William. The meeting should be one hour long and scheduled between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Both have busy schedules, so I need to check each day and find a time slot where neither is busy.\n\nFirst, I'll outline their availability for each day.\n\nStarting with Monday. Natalie is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-16:30. William is busy from 9:30-11:00, 11:30-17:00. So, looking for a one-hour slot where both are free.\n\nFrom 9:00-9:30, Natalie is busy, so no. Next, between 9:30-10:00, Natalie is free, but William is busy until 9:30 and then free until 11:00. Wait, William is busy from 9:30-11:00, so from 9:30-11:00 he's busy. So the next possible time after 11:00. Natalie is busy until 12:00, so maybe between 12:00-12:30? But Natalie is busy from 12:30-13:00, so 12:00-13:00 is partly busy for her. Hmm, maybe 13:00-14:00? Let's check. Natalie is free from 13:00-14:00, but William is busy from 11:30-17:00, so he's busy then. So no slot on Monday.\n\nMoving to Tuesday. Natalie's busy times: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 12:30-14:00, 16:00-17:00. William is busy 9:00-13:00 and 13:30-16:00. So possible slots: Let's see. From 9:30-10:00, Natalie is free, but William is busy until 13:00. So no. After 14:00, Natalie is free from 14:00-16:00, but William is busy until 13:00 and then from 13:30-16:00. So maybe 14:00-15:00? Natalie is free, but William is busy until 16:00. So no. What about after 16:00? Both have some busy times. Natalie is busy from 16:00-17:00, so no. So maybe no slot on Tuesday.\n\nWednesday: Natalie is busy 11:00-11:30 and 16:00-16:30. William is busy 9:00-12:30, 13:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. Let's check. From 9:00-11:00, William is busy. After 12:30, William is free until 13:00. So maybe 12:30-13:30? But Natalie is free from 9:00-11:00, 11:30-16:00, except her busy times. So 12:30-13:30: Natalie is free, but William is busy until 12:30 and then free until 13:00. So 12:30-13:30 is possible? Wait, William is busy until 12:30, so from 12:30-13:00 he's free. So a 30-minute slot. Not enough. Next, after 14:30, William is free until 15:30. Natalie is free until 16:00. So maybe 14:30-15:30? Let me check. Natalie is free from 14:30 onwards except 16:00-16:30. William is free from 14:30-15:30. So 14:30-15:30 is a possible slot. That's one hour. So Wednesday at 14:30-15:30 works.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Natalie's schedule on Wednesday: 11:00-11:30 and 16:00-16:30. So she's free from 9:00-11:00, 11:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. William's schedule: 9:00-12:30, 13:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So his free times are 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:30, and 16:00-16:30. So overlapping free time is 14:30-15:30. Yes, that works.\n\nSo the meeting can be scheduled on Wednesday from 14:30 to 15:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the busy intervals for Natalie and William for each day\n    natalie_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (10, 0, 12, 0), (12, 30, 13, 0), (14, 0, 14, 30), (15, 0, 16, 30)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (10, 0, 10, 30), (12, 30, 14, 0), (16, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(11, 0, 11, 30), (16, 0, 16, 30)],\n        \"Thursday\": [(10, 0, 11, 0), (11, 30, 15, 0), (15, 30, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    william_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 30, 11, 0), (11, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0, 13, 0), (13, 30, 16, 0)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 14, 30), (15, 30, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Thursday\": [(9, 0, 10, 30), (11, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 14, 0), (15, 0, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\"]\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    for day in days:\n        natalie_busy = natalie_schedule[day]\n        william_busy = william_schedule[day]\n\n        # Combine and sort busy intervals\n        combined_busy = sorted(natalie_busy + william_busy, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        current_time = start_time\n        for interval in combined_busy:\n            start, end = interval[0] * 60 + interval[1], interval[2] * 60 + interval[3]\n            if current_time + meeting_duration <= start:\n                # Found a slot\n                meeting_start = current_time\n                meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n                return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n            current_time = max(current_time, end)\n\n        # Check if there's time after the last busy interval\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            meeting_start = current_time\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
