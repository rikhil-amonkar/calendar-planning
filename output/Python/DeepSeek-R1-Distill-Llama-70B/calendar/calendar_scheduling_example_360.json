The meeting needs to be half an hour long, and it has to be on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Everyone's schedules are pretty busy, so I need to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times to have a clear picture.\n\nEmily is busy on Monday during:\n- 10:00 to 10:30\n- 16:00 to 16:30\n\nMason is free the entire day, so he's not a constraint.\n\nMaria is busy on Monday during:\n- 10:30 to 11:00\n- 14:00 to 14:30\n\nCarl is busy on Monday during:\n- 9:30 to 10:00\n- 10:30 to 12:30\n- 13:30 to 14:00\n- 14:30 to 15:30\n- 16:00 to 17:00\n\nDavid is busy on Monday during:\n- 9:30 to 11:00\n- 11:30 to 12:00\n- 12:30 to 13:30\n- 14:00 to 15:00\n- 16:00 to 17:00\n\nFrank is busy on Monday during:\n- 9:30 to 10:30\n- 11:00 to 11:30\n- 12:30 to 13:30\n- 14:30 to 17:00\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot where none of these people are busy. Since Mason is free all day, I only need to consider the other five.\n\nI'll start by looking at the earliest time slots and see if there's any overlap where everyone is free.\n\nFrom 9:00 to 9:30:\n- Carl is busy from 9:30, so the slot 9:00-9:30 might be possible.\n- But David is busy from 9:30 to 11:00, which overlaps at 9:30.\n- Frank is busy from 9:30 to 10:30.\n- So, 9:00-9:30 is not possible because of David and Frank's overlapping times.\n\nNext, 9:30 to 10:00:\n- Carl is busy until 10:00.\n- David is busy until 11:00.\n- Frank is busy until 10:30.\n- So, this slot is fully booked.\n\n10:00 to 10:30:\n- Emily is busy.\n- Frank is busy until 10:30.\n- So, not possible.\n\n10:30 to 11:00:\n- Maria is busy.\n- Frank is busy until 11:30.\n- So, no go.\n\n11:00 to 11:30:\n- Frank is busy.\n- David is busy until 11:00, but free after that.\n- Wait, David is busy from 9:30 to 11:00, so he's free at 11:00.\n- But Frank is busy until 11:30, so the slot 11:00-11:30 is partially busy for Frank.\n- So, not possible.\n\n11:30 to 12:00:\n- David is busy.\n- Frank is busy until 11:30, so 11:30-12:00 might be possible.\n- Let's check:\n  - Emily: Free\n  - Mason: Free\n  - Maria: Free (her busy times are 10:30-11:00 and 14:00-14:30)\n  - Carl: Busy until 12:30\n  - David: Busy until 12:00\n  - Frank: Busy until 11:30\n- So, at 11:30, Frank is free, but David is busy until 12:00.\n- Therefore, 11:30-12:00 is not possible.\n\n12:00 to 12:30:\n- Carl is busy until 12:30.\n- David is busy until 12:30.\n- Frank is busy until 13:30.\n- So, not possible.\n\n12:30 to 13:00:\n- Carl is busy until 13:30.\n- David is busy until 13:30.\n- Frank is busy until 13:30.\n- So, not possible.\n\n13:00 to 13:30:\n- Carl is busy until 13:30.\n- David is busy until 13:30.\n- Frank is busy until 13:30.\n- So, not possible.\n\n13:30 to 14:00:\n- Carl is busy until 14:00.\n- David is busy until 14:00.\n- Frank is busy until 14:30.\n- So, not possible.\n\n14:00 to 14:30:\n- Maria is busy.\n- Carl is busy until 14:30.\n- David is busy until 15:00.\n- Frank is busy until 17:00.\n- So, multiple conflicts.\n\n14:30 to 15:00:\n- Carl is busy until 15:30.\n- David is busy until 15:00.\n- Frank is busy until 17:00.\n- So, not possible.\n\n15:00 to 15:30:\n- Carl is busy until 15:30.\n- Frank is busy until 17:00.\n- So, not possible.\n\n15:30 to 16:00:\n- Emily is busy from 16:00.\n- Carl is busy from 16:00.\n- David is busy from 16:00.\n- Frank is busy until 17:00.\n- So, 15:30-16:00 is partially busy for Emily, Carl, David, and Frank.\n- Not possible.\n\n16:00 to 16:30:\n- Emily is busy.\n- Carl is busy until 17:00.\n- David is busy until 17:00.\n- Frank is busy until 17:00.\n- So, not possible.\n\n16:30 to 17:00:\n- Carl is busy until 17:00.\n- David is busy until 17:00.\n- Frank is busy until 17:00.\n- So, not possible.\n\nWait a minute, I went through all the time slots, and it seems like there's no available 30-minute slot where everyone is free. But the problem states that there exists a solution. Did I miss something?\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the busy times.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Emily: 10:00-10:30 and 16:00-16:30\n- Mason: Free all day\n- Maria: 10:30-11:00 and 14:00-14:30\n- Carl: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n- David: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00\n- Frank: 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:30, 14:30-17:00\n\nLet me try to find a time that works:\n\nLooking at 13:00 to 13:30:\n- Emily: Free\n- Mason: Free\n- Maria: Free (busy at 14:00)\n- Carl: Busy until 13:30\n- David: Busy until 13:30\n- Frank: Busy until 13:30\n- So, 13:00-13:30 is busy for Carl, David, and Frank.\n\nHow about 12:00 to 12:30:\n- Carl: Busy until 12:30\n- David: Busy until 12:30\n- Frank: Busy until 13:30\n- So, no.\n\nWhat about 11:00 to 11:30:\n- Frank is busy until 11:30\n- David is busy until 11:00\n- So, 11:00-11:30: Frank is busy, David is free after 11:00\n- But Frank is busy until 11:30, so it's partially busy.\n\nWait, is there any slot that I missed?\n\nMaybe 9:00 to 9:30:\n- Emily: Free\n- Mason: Free\n- Maria: Free\n- Carl: Busy from 9:30\n- David: Busy from 9:30\n- Frank: Busy from 9:30\n- So, 9:00-9:30: Carl, David, Frank are busy from 9:30, but the meeting would end at 9:30, which is when they start being busy. So, 9:00-9:30 might be possible.\n\nBut wait, the meeting needs to be within 9:00 to 17:00, so starting at 9:00 and ending at 9:30 is acceptable, as it's within the work hours.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- Emily: Free\n- Mason: Free\n- Maria: Free\n- Carl: Busy starts at 9:30, so 9:00-9:30 is free\n- David: Busy starts at 9:30, so 9:00-9:30 is free\n- Frank: Busy starts at 9:30, so 9:00-9:30 is free\n\nYes, it seems like 9:00-9:30 is a possible slot.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was not possible because of overlapping, but now I see that 9:00-9:30 is free for everyone except Carl, David, and Frank, who start their busy times at 9:30. So, the meeting would end exactly when they start being busy, which should be acceptable.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 9:00 to 9:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes since midnight\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00\n\n    # Meeting duration in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n\n    # Participants' busy intervals on Monday in minutes since midnight\n    emily_busy = [\n        (10 * 60, 10 * 60 + 30),  # 10:00-10:30\n        (16 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)   # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n    maria_busy = [\n        (10 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60),  # 10:30-11:00\n        (14 * 60, 14 * 60 + 30)   # 14:00-14:30\n    ]\n    carl_busy = [\n        (9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60),   # 9:30-10:00\n        (10 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60 + 30),  # 10:30-12:30\n        (13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60),  # 13:30-14:00\n        (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60 + 30),  # 14:30-15:30\n        (16 * 60, 17 * 60)        # 16:00-17:00\n    ]\n    david_busy = [\n        (9 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60),   # 9:30-11:00\n        (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60),  # 11:30-12:00\n        (12 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60 + 30),  # 12:30-13:30\n        (14 * 60, 15 * 60),       # 14:00-15:00\n        (16 * 60, 17 * 60)        # 16:00-17:00\n    ]\n    frank_busy = [\n        (9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60 + 30),  # 9:30-10:30\n        (11 * 60, 11 * 60 + 30),      # 11:00-11:30\n        (12 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60 + 30),  # 12:30-13:30\n        (14 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)       # 14:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Function to convert minutes to HH:MM format\n    def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n        return f\"{minutes // 60:02d}:{minutes % 60:02d}\"\n\n    # Function to check if a time slot is free for a person\n    def is_time_free(busy_intervals, start_time, end_time):\n        if end_time > work_end or start_time < work_start:\n            return False\n        for busy_start, busy_end in busy_intervals:\n            if not (end_time <= busy_start or start_time >= busy_end):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Find common free time slots\n    time_slots = []\n    current_time = work_start\n    while current_time + meeting_duration <= work_end:\n        end_time = current_time + meeting_duration\n        # Check if all participants are free\n        if (is_time_free(emily_busy, current_time, end_time) and\n            is_time_free(maria_busy, current_time, end_time) and\n            is_time_free(carl_busy, current_time, end_time) and\n            is_time_free(david_busy, current_time, end_time) and\n            is_time_free(frank_busy, current_time, end_time)):\n            time_slots.append((current_time, end_time))\n        current_time += 30  # Check every 30 minutes\n\n    # If any time slots found, return the first one\n    if time_slots:\n        start, end = time_slots[0]\n        start_time = minutes_to_time(start)\n        end_time = minutes_to_time(end)\n        return f\"{start_time}:{end_time} on Monday\"\n\n    return \"No common time slot found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
