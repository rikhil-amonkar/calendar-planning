So, I need to find a suitable time for Gary and David to have a one-hour meeting between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on either Monday or Tuesday. Both of them have blocked certain times on both days, so I need to find a slot where neither of them is busy.\n\nFirst, I'll list out their schedules to get a clear picture.\n\nFor Gary:\n- Monday: Blocked from 9:30-10:00, 11:00-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 16:30-17:00\n- Tuesday: Blocked from 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 14:30-16:00\n\nFor David:\n- Monday: Blocked from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-13:00, 14:30-16:30\n- Tuesday: Blocked from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-12:30, 13:00-14:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n\nOkay, so I need to look for a one-hour slot that's free for both on either day.\n\nLet me start by checking Monday.\n\nOn Monday, Gary is free from 9:00-9:30, but David is blocked until 9:30. So maybe right after that? But Gary is blocked from 9:30-10:00, and David from 10:00-13:00. So the earliest they might both be free is after 10:00, but Gary is blocked until 11:00.\n\nWait, Gary is blocked from 11:00-13:00 on Monday, and David is also blocked until 13:00. So after 13:00, let's see.\n\nFrom 13:00 to 14:00, Gary is free, but David is blocked until 14:30. So maybe between 14:00 and 14:30? Gary is blocked from 14:00-14:30, so that's no good.\n\nAfter that, Gary is free from 14:30-16:30, but David is blocked until 16:30. So perhaps between 16:30 and 17:00? But Gary is blocked from 16:30-17:00.\n\nHmm, seems tough on Monday. Maybe Tuesday is better.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gary is blocked from 9:00-9:30, and David is also blocked until 9:30. So starting at 9:30, Gary is free until 10:30, but David is free from 9:30-10:00, then blocked until 10:30.\n\nWait, David is blocked from 10:00-10:30, so from 10:30 onwards, both are free? Let's check.\n\nGary is free from 9:30-10:30, except he's blocked from 10:30-11:00. David is free from 10:30-11:00. So maybe from 10:30-11:30?\n\nBut Gary is blocked from 10:30-11:00, so that's not possible. After that, Gary is free from 11:00-14:30, but David is blocked from 11:00-12:30 and 13:00-14:30.\n\nSo between 12:30 and 13:00, both might be free. Let's see.\n\nGary is free from 11:00-14:30, except his other blocks, but on Tuesday, his main block is 14:30-16:00.\n\nDavid is free from 12:30-13:00 and then blocked again.\n\nSo a possible slot could be 12:30-13:30. Let me check:\n\nGary: Is he free from 12:30-13:30? Yes, since his blocks on Tuesday are 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, and 14:30-16:00.\n\nDavid: From 12:30-13:30, he's blocked until 13:00, so only from 13:00-13:30 he's free. But we need a full hour. So 13:00-14:00? David is blocked from 13:00-14:30, so that's no good.\n\nWait, maybe 14:30-15:30? Let's check:\n\nGary is blocked from 14:30-16:00, so that's not possible.\n\nWhat about 15:30-16:30? Gary is blocked until 16:00, and David is blocked from 15:00-16:00 and 16:30-17:00.\n\nHmm, tricky. Maybe 16:00-17:00? Gary is free after 16:00, and David is blocked until 16:30, so 16:30-17:00 is blocked for David.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let's go back.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gary's blocks are 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, and 14:30-16:00.\n\nDavid's blocks are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-12:30, 13:00-14:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nLooking for a one-hour slot where both are free.\n\nFrom 9:30-10:30: Gary is free, David is free from 9:30-10:00, but blocked from 10:00-10:30. So possible slot: 9:30-10:30, but David is busy from 10:00.\n\nNot a full hour.\n\nFrom 10:30-11:30: Gary is blocked from 10:30-11:00, so no.\n\nFrom 11:00-12:00: Gary is free, David is blocked until 12:30. So 12:00-13:00: David is blocked from 13:00.\n\nFrom 12:30-13:30: David is blocked from 13:00.\n\nFrom 13:30-14:30: David is blocked until 14:30.\n\nFrom 14:30-15:30: Gary is blocked.\n\nFrom 15:30-16:30: David is blocked until 16:00.\n\nFrom 16:00-17:00: Gary is free after 16:00, David is blocked from 16:30.\n\nWait, 16:00-17:00: Gary is free, David is blocked from 16:30-17:00. So 16:00-16:30 is free for both?\n\nDavid is blocked from 16:30, so 16:00-17:00 is partially blocked. Not a full hour.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's check again.\n\nWait, on Tuesday, Gary is blocked from 14:30-16:00, so from 16:00 onwards, he's free.\n\nDavid is blocked from 15:00-16:00 and 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo from 16:00-16:30, David is free, and Gary is free.\n\nThat's a 30-minute slot, but we need an hour.\n\nWait, maybe I overlooked something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meeting can be scheduled on Monday.\n\nWait, on Monday, Gary is blocked from 16:30-17:00, but David is blocked from 14:30-16:30.\n\nSo from 16:30-17:00, Gary is blocked, David is blocked until 16:30.\n\nSo maybe 16:30-17:00 is not possible.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the meeting can start earlier.\n\nOn Tuesday, from 12:30-13:30: David is blocked from 13:00-14:30, so only 12:30-13:00 is free, which is not enough.\n\nFrom 14:30-15:30: Gary is blocked.\n\nFrom 15:30-16:30: David is blocked from 15:00-16:00.\n\nWait, maybe 16:00-17:00 is the only slot, but David is blocked from 16:30.\n\nSo perhaps the meeting can start at 16:00 and end at 17:00, but David is busy from 16:30.\n\nSo that's not a full hour.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's list out all possible free slots for both.\n\nFor Tuesday:\n\nGary's free slots:\n\n9:30-10:30 (except 10:30-11:00 blocked)\n\n11:00-14:30\n\n16:00-17:00\n\nDavid's free slots:\n\n9:30-10:00\n\n10:30-11:00\n\n12:30-13:00\n\n14:30-15:00\n\n16:00-16:30\n\nLooking for an overlapping one-hour slot.\n\nFrom 16:00-17:00:\n\nGary is free from 16:00-17:00\n\nDavid is free from 16:00-16:30\n\nSo overlapping from 16:00-16:30, but we need a full hour.\n\nWait, maybe the meeting can start at 15:30?\n\nBut Gary is blocked until 16:00.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 14:30-15:30?\n\nGary is blocked from 14:30-16:00, so no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the blocks.\n\nLet me re-express their schedules in minutes since midnight to make it easier.\n\nFor Gary on Tuesday:\n\n- 9:00-9:30 \u2192 540-570\n- 10:30-11:00 \u2192 630-660\n- 14:30-16:00 \u2192 870-960\n\nSo his free times are:\n\n570-630, 660-870, and 960-1020 (assuming 17:00 is 1020)\n\nDavid on Tuesday:\n\n- 9:00-9:30 \u2192 540-570\n- 10:00-10:30 \u2192 600-630\n- 11:00-12:30 \u2192 660-750\n- 13:00-14:30 \u2192 780-870\n- 15:00-16:00 \u2192 900-960\n- 16:30-17:00 \u2192 990-1020\n\nSo his free times are:\n\n570-600, 630-660, 750-780, 870-900, 960-990\n\nNow, looking for a one-hour slot where both are free.\n\nLet's check each possible slot.\n\nFrom 570-630 (9:30-10:30):\n\nGary is free from 570-630\n\nDavid is free from 570-600 and 630-660\n\nSo overlapping from 570-600 and 630-630 (only 30 minutes)\n\nNot enough.\n\nFrom 660-870 (11:00-14:30):\n\nGary is free from 660-870\n\nDavid is free from 750-780 and 870-900\n\nSo overlapping from 750-780 and 870-870 (only 30 minutes)\n\nNot enough.\n\nFrom 960-1020 (16:00-17:00):\n\nGary is free from 960-1020\n\nDavid is free from 960-990\n\nSo overlapping from 960-990 (only 30 minutes)\n\nNot enough.\n\nWait, so there's no one-hour slot on Tuesday where both are free.\n\nBut the problem states that there is a solution.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the schedules.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nGary's Tuesday blocks: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 14:30-16:00\n\nSo free times:\n\n9:30-10:30, 11:00-14:30, 16:00-17:00\n\nDavid's Tuesday blocks: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-12:30, 13:00-14:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n\nFree times:\n\n9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30\n\nLooking for a one-hour overlap.\n\nFrom Gary's free times:\n\n9:30-10:30 overlaps with David's 9:30-10:00 \u2192 30 minutes\n\n11:00-14:30 overlaps with David's 12:30-13:00 and 14:30-15:00 \u2192 only 30 minutes each\n\n16:00-17:00 overlaps with David's 16:00-16:30 \u2192 30 minutes\n\nWait, maybe I missed something.\n\nIs there a way to have a one-hour slot?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meeting can be scheduled on Monday.\n\nLet me check Monday again.\n\nGary's Monday blocks: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 16:30-17:00\n\nFree times:\n\n9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-16:30, 16:30-17:00 (but he's blocked from 16:30)\n\nDavid's Monday blocks: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-13:00, 14:30-16:30\n\nFree times:\n\n9:30-10:00, 13:00-14:30, 16:30-17:00\n\nLooking for overlap.\n\nGary's free times on Monday:\n\n9:00-9:30 overlaps with David's 9:30-10:00 \u2192 no\n\n10:00-11:00 overlaps with David's 10:00-13:00 block \u2192 no\n\n13:00-14:00 overlaps with David's 13:00-14:30 \u2192 possible\n\nFrom 13:00-14:00, both are free.\n\nYes! So 13:00-14:00 on Monday works.\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nGary is free from 13:00-14:00 (since his block is 14:00-14:30)\n\nDavid is free from 13:00-14:30\n\nSo 13:00-14:00 is a full hour where both are free.\n\nI think that's the slot.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each participant as dictionaries with their busy intervals\n    schedules = {\n        'Gary': {\n            'Monday': [(9*60 + 30, 10*60), (11*60, 13*60), (14*60, 14*60 + 30), (16*60 + 30, 17*60)],\n            'Tuesday': [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (10*60 + 30, 11*60), (14*60 + 30, 16*60)]\n        },\n        'David': {\n            'Monday': [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (10*60, 13*60), (14*60 + 30, 16*60 + 30)],\n            'Tuesday': [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (10*60, 10*60 + 30), (11*60, 12*60 + 30), \n                        (13*60, 14*60 + 30), (15*60, 16*60), (16*60 + 30, 17*60)]\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Convert time ranges to minutes since midnight for easier comparison\n    def time_to_minutes(hours, minutes):\n        return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n    # Generate all possible 60-minute time slots between 9:00 and 17:00\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    time_slots = []\n    for t in range(start_time, end_time - 60, 30):\n        time_slots.append((t, t + 60))\n\n    # Check each time slot against both participants' schedules\n    for day in ['Monday', 'Tuesday']:\n        for slot in time_slots:\n            start, end = slot\n            gary_available = True\n            for busy_start, busy_end in schedules['Gary'][day]:\n                if not (end <= busy_start or start >= busy_end):\n                    gary_available = False\n                    break\n            if not gary_available:\n                continue\n\n            david_available = True\n            for busy_start, busy_end in schedules['David'][day]:\n                if not (end <= busy_start or start >= busy_end):\n                    david_available = False\n                    break\n            if david_available:\n                # Convert the time slot back to HH:MM format\n                hours_start = start // 60\n                minutes_start = start % 60\n                hours_end = end // 60\n                minutes_end = end % 60\n                return f\"The proposed meeting time is {hours_start:02d}:{minutes_start:02d}:{hours_end:02d}:{minutes_end:02d} on {day}.\"\n\n    # If no time slot found (though the problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No available time slot found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
