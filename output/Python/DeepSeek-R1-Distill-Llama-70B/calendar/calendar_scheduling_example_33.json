            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this meeting scheduling problem. So, I need to find a suitable time for Lisa, Bobby, and Randy to meet for half an hour on Monday, considering their busy schedules and Bobby's preference to avoid meetings after 15:00.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's schedules to visualize their availability.\n\nLisa's schedule:\n- 9:00 to 10:00\n- 10:30 to 11:30\n- 12:30 to 13:00\n- 16:00 to 16:30\n\nBobby's schedule:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 10:00 to 10:30\n- 11:30 to 12:00\n- 15:00 to 15:30\n\nRandy's schedule:\n- 9:30 to 10:00\n- 10:30 to 11:00\n- 11:30 to 12:30\n- 13:00 to 13:30\n- 14:30 to 15:30\n- 16:00 to 16:30\n\nNow, Bobby doesn't want any meetings after 15:00, so I need to focus on times before that.\n\nI'll start by looking at the earliest possible time, which is 9:00. But Lisa is busy from 9:00 to 10:00, and Bobby is busy from 9:00 to 9:30. Randy is free from 9:00 to 9:30, but since both Lisa and Bobby are busy, this slot doesn't work.\n\nNext, from 9:30 to 10:00, Lisa is free, Bobby is free, but Randy is busy. So that doesn't work either.\n\nFrom 10:00 to 10:30, Lisa is busy until 10:30, Bobby is busy until 10:30, and Randy is busy from 10:30 to 11:00. So, no luck there.\n\nLooking at 10:30 to 11:30, Lisa is busy until 11:30, Bobby is free after 10:30, but Randy is busy until 11:00. After 11:00, Randy is free, but Lisa is still busy until 11:30. So, maybe from 11:00 to 11:30? Let's check:\n\n- Lisa: Busy until 11:30\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 11:00, then free.\n\nSo, from 11:00 to 11:30, Lisa is still busy, so that's not possible.\n\nNext, from 11:30 to 12:00, Lisa is free, Bobby is busy until 12:00, and Randy is busy until 12:30. So, no go.\n\nFrom 12:00 to 12:30, Lisa is free, Bobby is free, and Randy is busy until 12:30. So, maybe from 12:00 to 12:30? But Randy is busy until 12:30, so that doesn't work.\n\nFrom 12:30 to 13:00, Lisa is busy, Bobby is free, and Randy is busy until 13:00. So, no.\n\nFrom 13:00 to 13:30, Lisa is free after 13:00, Bobby is free, and Randy is busy until 13:30. So, maybe from 13:00 to 13:30? But Randy is busy until 13:30, so that's not possible.\n\nFrom 13:30 to 14:30, Lisa is free, Bobby is free, and Randy is busy until 15:30. So, no.\n\nFrom 14:30 to 15:00, Lisa is free, Bobby is free, and Randy is busy until 15:30. So, no.\n\nFrom 15:00 to 15:30, Lisa is free, Bobby is busy until 15:30, and Randy is busy until 15:30. So, no.\n\nFrom 15:30 to 16:00, Lisa is free, Bobby is free (since he avoids after 15:00, but 15:30 is within his preference), and Randy is busy until 16:30.\n\nWait, Bobby's preference is to avoid meetings after 15:00. So, 15:30 is after 15:00, which he wants to avoid. So, this slot is out.\n\nFrom 16:00 to 16:30, Lisa is busy, Bobby is free, and Randy is busy. So, no.\n\nHmm, it seems like there's no slot that fits all three. But the problem states that there is a solution. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me double-check. Perhaps there's a slot between 14:00 and 14:30?\n\nFrom 14:00 to 14:30:\n\n- Lisa: Free\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 15:30\n\nSo, Randy is busy. Not possible.\n\nWhat about 13:30 to 14:00?\n\n- Lisa: Free\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 15:30\n\nStill, Randy is busy.\n\nWait, maybe earlier in the day. Let's revisit the morning.\n\nFrom 10:30 to 11:00:\n\n- Lisa: Busy until 11:30\n- Bobby: Busy until 10:30\n- Randy: Busy until 11:00\n\nSo, at 11:00, Lisa is still busy until 11:30, Bobby is free, and Randy is free after 11:00.\n\nSo, from 11:00 to 11:30:\n\n- Lisa: Busy until 11:30\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Free\n\nBut Lisa is busy, so that doesn't work.\n\nFrom 11:30 to 12:00:\n\n- Lisa: Free\n- Bobby: Busy until 12:00\n- Randy: Busy until 12:30\n\nSo, no.\n\nFrom 12:00 to 12:30:\n\n- Lisa: Free\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 12:30\n\nAlmost there, but Randy is busy until 12:30.\n\nFrom 12:30 to 13:00:\n\n- Lisa: Busy\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 13:00\n\nNope.\n\nFrom 13:00 to 13:30:\n\n- Lisa: Free after 13:00\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 13:30\n\nSo, from 13:00 to 13:30, Randy is busy until 13:30. Not possible.\n\nFrom 13:30 to 14:00:\n\n- Lisa: Free\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 15:30\n\nStill, Randy is busy.\n\nFrom 14:00 to 14:30:\n\n- Lisa: Free\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 15:30\n\nNo luck.\n\nFrom 14:30 to 15:00:\n\n- Lisa: Free\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 15:30\n\nStill busy.\n\nFrom 15:00 to 15:30:\n\n- Lisa: Free\n- Bobby: Busy until 15:30\n- Randy: Busy until 15:30\n\nBobby and Randy are busy.\n\nFrom 15:30 to 16:00:\n\n- Lisa: Free\n- Bobby: Prefers not to meet after 15:00\n- Randy: Busy until 16:30\n\nBobby's preference makes this slot invalid.\n\nFrom 16:00 to 16:30:\n\n- Lisa: Busy\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 16:30\n\nNo.\n\nWait a minute. Maybe there's a slot between 9:30 to 10:00?\n\nFrom 9:30 to 10:00:\n\n- Lisa: Busy until 10:00\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Busy until 10:00\n\nSo, Lisa and Randy are busy.\n\nHmm, I'm struggling to find a slot. Let me try a different approach. Let's merge all the busy times and look for gaps.\n\nCombined busy schedule:\n\n- 9:00 to 10:00 (Lisa)\n- 9:00 to 9:30 (Bobby)\n- 9:30 to 10:00 (Randy)\n- 10:00 to 10:30 (Bobby)\n- 10:30 to 11:00 (Randy)\n- 10:30 to 11:30 (Lisa)\n- 11:30 to 12:00 (Bobby)\n- 11:30 to 12:30 (Randy)\n- 12:30 to 13:00 (Lisa)\n- 13:00 to 13:30 (Randy)\n- 14:30 to 15:30 (Randy)\n- 15:00 to 15:30 (Bobby)\n- 16:00 to 16:30 (Lisa and Randy)\n\nNow, let's sort these intervals:\n\n1. 9:00 to 10:00 (Lisa)\n2. 9:00 to 9:30 (Bobby)\n3. 9:30 to 10:00 (Randy)\n4. 10:00 to 10:30 (Bobby)\n5. 10:30 to 11:00 (Randy)\n6. 10:30 to 11:30 (Lisa)\n7. 11:30 to 12:00 (Bobby)\n8. 11:30 to 12:30 (Randy)\n9. 12:30 to 13:00 (Lisa)\n10. 13:00 to 13:30 (Randy)\n11. 14:30 to 15:30 (Randy)\n12. 15:00 to 15:30 (Bobby)\n13. 16:00 to 16:30 (Lisa and Randy)\n\nNow, let's look for gaps where all three are free.\n\nAfter 13:30 to 14:30:\n\n- 13:30 to 14:30: Randy is free, Lisa is free, Bobby is free.\n\nThis seems like a possible slot. Let's check:\n\nFrom 13:30 to 14:00:\n\n- Lisa: Free\n- Bobby: Free\n- Randy: Free\n\nYes, this slot works. It's within Bobby's preferred time (before 15:00) and doesn't conflict with anyone's schedule.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 13:30 to 14:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9,\n        \"end\": 17\n    }\n\n    # Define participants' schedules\n    lisa_schedule = [[9, 10], [10.5, 11.5], [12.5, 13], [16, 16.5]]\n    bobby_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [10, 10.5], [11.5, 12], [15, 15.5]]\n    randy_schedule = [[9.5, 10], [10.5, 11], [11.5, 12.5], [13, 13.5], [14.5, 15.5], [16, 16.5]]\n\n    # Combine all schedules\n    all_schedules = [\n        lisa_schedule,\n        bobby_schedule,\n        randy_schedule\n    ]\n\n    # Flatten and sort all busy intervals\n    all_busy = []\n    for schedule in all_schedules:\n        all_busy.extend(schedule)\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Initialize previous end time to work hours start\n    prev_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n\n    # Bobby's preference: avoid meetings after 15:00\n    bobby_preference = 15\n\n    # Apply Bobby's preference\n    if prev_end < bobby_preference:\n        prev_end = bobby_preference\n\n    # Iterate through each busy interval\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        # Check for available slot before the busy interval starts\n        if busy_start - prev_end >= 0.5:  # 0.5 hours = 30 minutes\n            # Format the time slots\n            start_time = prev_end\n            end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n            # Convert to HH:MM format\n            start_hh = int(start_time)\n            start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n            end_hh = int(end_time)\n            end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n            # Return the earliest available time\n            return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n        \n        # Update previous end time\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, busy_end)\n\n    # Check for available slot after the last busy interval\n    if work_hours[\"end\"] - prev_end >= 0.5:\n        start_time = prev_end\n        end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n        start_hh = int(start_time)\n        start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n        end_hh = int(end_time)\n        end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n        return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
