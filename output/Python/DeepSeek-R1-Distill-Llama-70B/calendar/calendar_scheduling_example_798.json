            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to find a suitable time for a meeting between Nancy and Jose. The meeting should be half an hour long and can be scheduled on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00. Both Nancy and Jose have busy schedules on these days, so I'll need to carefully compare their availability to find a time that works for both.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Nancy's schedule:\n\n- **Monday**: Blocked from 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00.\n- **Tuesday**: Blocked from 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, and 15:30 to 16:00.\n- **Wednesday**: Blocked from 10:00 to 11:30 and 13:30 to 16:00.\n\nNow, Jose's schedule:\n\n- **Monday**: Busy the entire day from 9:00 to 17:00.\n- **Tuesday**: Busy the entire day from 9:00 to 17:00.\n- **Wednesday**: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 17:00.\n\nGiven that both Monday and Tuesday are fully booked for Jose, the earliest availability must be on Wednesday. \n\nOn Wednesday, Nancy is free before 10:00 and between 11:30 and 13:30, and after 16:00. However, Jose is available from 9:30 to 10:00 and between 12:30 and 13:30, and from 14:30 to 15:00.\n\nComparing their available slots on Wednesday:\n\n- **Nancy's available slots**:\n  - 9:00 to 10:00\n  - 11:30 to 13:30\n  - 16:00 to 17:00\n\n- **Jose's available slots**:\n  - 9:30 to 10:00\n  - 12:30 to 13:30\n  - 14:30 to 15:00\n\nThe overlapping times when both are free are:\n\n1. **9:30 to 10:00**: This is a 30-minute slot, which fits the meeting duration perfectly.\n2. **12:30 to 13:30**: Another 60-minute slot where both are free, but since we need only 30 minutes, this also works.\n3. **14:30 to 15:00**: This is a 30-minute slot as well.\n\nSince the group prefers to meet at their earliest availability, the first possible time is 9:30 to 10:00 on Wednesday.\n\nI'll now create a Python script to implement this logic. The script will:\n\n1. Define the work hours and participants' schedules.\n2. Convert time strings to minutes for easier comparison.\n3. Identify available time slots for each participant.\n4. Find overlapping available slots that can accommodate the 30-minute meeting.\n5. Output the earliest available time in the required format.\n\nHere's the Python script:\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    start_time = \"09:00\"\n    end_time = \"17:00\"\n    \n    # Define participants' busy intervals as dictionaries with name and time ranges\n    participants = {\n        \"Nancy\": {\n            \"Monday\": [\n                (\"10:00\", \"10:30\"),\n                (\"11:30\", \"12:30\"),\n                (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"),\n                (\"14:30\", \"15:30\"),\n                (\"16:00\", \"17:00\")\n            ],\n            \"Tuesday\": [\n                (\"09:30\", \"10:30\"),\n                (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"),\n                (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n                (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"),\n                (\"15:30\", \"16:00\")\n            ],\n            \"Wednesday\": [\n                (\"10:00\", \"11:30\"),\n                (\"13:30\", \"16:00\")\n            ]\n        },\n        \"Jose\": {\n            \"Monday\": [\n                (\"09:00\", \"17:00\")\n            ],\n            \"Tuesday\": [\n                (\"09:00\", \"17:00\")\n            ],\n            \"Wednesday\": [\n                (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n                (\"10:00\", \"12:30\"),\n                (\"13:30\", \"14:30\"),\n                (\"15:00\", \"17:00\")\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Convert time strings to minutes since midnight for easier comparison\n    def time_to_minutes(time_str):\n        hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n        return hours * 60 + mins\n    \n    # Convert all busy intervals to minutes\n    busy_intervals = {}\n    for name, schedules in participants.items():\n        busy = {}\n        for day, intervals in schedules.items():\n            busy_day = []\n            for start, end in intervals:\n                busy_start = time_to_minutes(start)\n                busy_end = time_to_minutes(end)\n                busy_day.append((busy_start, busy_end))\n            busy[day] = busy_day\n        busy_intervals[name] = busy\n    \n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Generate all possible time slots within work hours\n    work_start = time_to_minutes(start_time)\n    work_end = time_to_minutes(end_time)\n    \n    # Find all available time slots for each participant\n    available_slots = {}\n    for name, schedules in busy_intervals.items():\n        available = {}\n        for day in [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]:\n            intervals = schedules.get(day, [])\n            available_day = []\n            previous_end = work_start\n            \n            # Add available slots before the first busy interval\n            if intervals and intervals[0][0] > previous_end:\n                available_day.append((previous_end, intervals[0][0]))\n            \n            # Add available slots between busy intervals\n            for i in range(1, len(intervals)):\n                current_start = intervals[i-1][1]\n                next_start = intervals[i][0]\n                if current_start < next_start:\n                    available_day.append((current_start, next_start))\n            \n            # Add available slots after the last busy interval\n            if intervals:\n                last_end = intervals[-1][1]\n                if last_end < work_end:\n                    available_day.append((last_end, work_end))\n            else:\n                # If no busy intervals, the entire work time is available\n                available_day.append((work_start, work_end))\n            \n            available[day] = available_day\n        available_slots[name] = available\n    \n    # Find overlapping available slots that can accommodate the meeting duration\n    nancy_available = available_slots[\"Nancy\"]\n    jose_available = available_slots[\"Jose\"]\n    \n    overlapping_slots = {}\n    for day in [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]:\n        nancy_day_slots = nancy_available.get(day, [])\n        jose_day_slots = jose_available.get(day, [])\n        \n        day_overlapping = []\n        for n_slot in nancy_day_slots:\n            for j_slot in jose_day_slots:\n                # Find the overlapping start and end\n                start = max(n_slot[0], j_slot[0])\n                end = min(n_slot[1], j_slot[1])\n                \n                if end -
