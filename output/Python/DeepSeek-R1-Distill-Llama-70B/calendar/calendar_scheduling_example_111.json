The task is to find a suitable time for a meeting involving Gregory, Natalie, Christine, and Vincent. The meeting needs to be half an hour long and has to be scheduled between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on Monday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand everyone's availability. Let's break down each person's schedule:\n\n- **Gregory** is busy from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, and 13:30 to 14:00. So, he's free from 11:30 to 12:30, and then from 14:00 onwards.\n\n- **Natalie** has no meetings all day, which is great because it means she's available anytime.\n\n- **Christine** is busy from 9:00 to 11:30 and from 13:30 to 17:00. So, she's free between 11:30 and 13:30, and then after 17:00, but since our meeting has to be by 17:00, we can only consider up to that.\n\n- **Vincent** is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 17:00. So, his available slots are from 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, and 14:00 to 14:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that works for everyone. Let's look for overlapping free times.\n\nStarting with **Gregory** and **Vincent**, since they have the most restrictions:\n\n- Gregory is free from 11:30 to 12:30 and from 14:00 onwards.\n- Vincent is free from 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, and 14:00 to 14:30.\n\nSo, overlapping times between Gregory and Vincent are:\n\n- 12:00 to 12:30\n- 14:00 to 14:30\n\nNow, let's check **Christine**'s availability in these slots:\n\n- **12:00 to 12:30**: Christine is free from 11:30 to 13:30, so this slot works.\n- **14:00 to 14:30**: Christine is busy from 13:30 onwards, so this slot doesn't work.\n\nSo, the only overlapping time between Gregory, Vincent, and Christine is **12:00 to 12:30**.\n\nSince **Natalie** is available all day, this time works for her as well.\n\nTherefore, the proposed meeting time is **12:00 to 12:30** on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Define the work hours and meeting duration\nwork_start = \"09:00\"\nwork_end = \"17:00\"\nmeeting_duration = 30  # in minutes\n\n# Define participants' schedules\nparticipants = {\n    \"Gregory\": [(\"09:00\", \"10:00\"), (\"10:30\", \"11:30\"), (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"), (\"13:30\", \"14:00\")],\n    \"Natalie\": [],\n    \"Christine\": [(\"09:00\", \"11:30\"), (\"13:30\", \"17:00\")],\n    \"Vincent\": [(\"09:00\", \"09:30\"), (\"10:30\", \"12:00\"), (\"12:30\", \"14:00\"), (\"14:30\", \"17:00\")]\n}\n\n# Convert time strings to minutes since midnight for easier calculations\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n# Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    minutes = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n# Find the earliest available time slot that fits all constraints\nwork_start_minutes = time_to_minutes(work_start)\nwork_end_minutes = time_to_minutes(work_end)\nmeeting_end_minutes = work_start_minutes + meeting_duration\n\n# Initialize available time as the entire work day\navailable_start = work_start_minutes\navailable_end = work_end_minutes\n\n# Check each participant's schedule to find common free time\nfor name, schedule in participants.items():\n    # Sort the schedule by start time\n    sorted_schedule = sorted(schedule, key=lambda x: time_to_minutes(x[0]))\n    \n    # Initialize with the work start time\n    current_start = work_start_minutes\n    \n    for slot in sorted_schedule:\n        slot_start = time_to_minutes(slot[0])\n        slot_end = time_to_minutes(slot[1])\n        \n        # If the slot starts after the current available start, update the available start\n        if slot_start > current_start:\n            current_start = max(current_start, slot_end)\n    \n    # Update the overall available time\n    available_start = max(available_start, current_start)\n\n# Ensure the meeting time is within work hours\nif available_start + meeting_duration > work_end_minutes:\n    print(\"No available time slot found within constraints.\")\nelse:\n    meeting_start = available_start\n    meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n    print(f\"Proposed meeting time: {minutes_to_time(meeting_start)}:{minutes_to_time(meeting_end)} on Monday\")\n```",
