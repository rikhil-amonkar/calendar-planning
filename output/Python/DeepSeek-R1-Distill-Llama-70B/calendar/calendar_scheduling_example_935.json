            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help the user by generating a Python script that finds a suitable meeting time for Terry and Frances. The meeting should be half an hour long and can be scheduled between Monday and Friday. The user also mentioned that Frances would like to avoid more meetings on Tuesday, so I should prioritize other days first.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Understand the Schedules**: I need to parse the busy times for both Terry and Frances across all five days. This means converting their schedules into a structured format, probably a list of tuples representing the start and end times in minutes since midnight.\n\n2. **Combine and Sort Busy Intervals**: For each day, I'll combine Terry's and Frances's busy intervals into a single list and sort them by start time. This helps in easily identifying free slots.\n\n3. **Search for Available Slots**: Starting from 9:00 AM (540 minutes), I'll check each day in the order of priority (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Tuesday last) to find the earliest available half-hour slot that doesn't conflict with either of their schedules.\n\n4. **Handle Preferences**: Since Frances wants to avoid meetings on Tuesday, I'll prioritize Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday first. If no slot is found on those days, I'll then check Tuesday.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once a suitable time is found, I'll format it as HH:MM:HH:MM and include the day of the week. If no time is found, I'll return a message indicating that.\n\nNow, I'll think about how to structure the data. Each person's schedule is given as a list of time blocks for each day. I'll convert these into minutes since midnight to make it easier to compare and sort.\n\nFor example, Terry's Monday schedule is:\n- 10:30 to 11:00\n- 12:30 to 14:00\n- 15:00 to 17:00\n\nI'll convert these to:\n- (10*60+30, 11*60) \u2192 (630, 660)\n- (12*60+30, 14*60) \u2192 (750, 840)\n- (15*60, 17*60) \u2192 (900, 1020)\n\nI'll do the same for Frances's schedule and all other days.\n\nNext, for each day, I'll combine both Terry's and Frances's busy intervals, sort them, and then iterate through them to find gaps where both have availability.\n\nI'll start checking from 9:00 AM, and for each busy interval, I'll see if there's a gap before it that can fit a 30-minute meeting. If I find such a gap, I'll immediately return that time as the earliest available slot.\n\nIf I don't find a slot on the preferred days, I'll then check Tuesday, applying the same logic.\n\nI'll also need to handle the end of the day, ensuring that the meeting doesn't go beyond 17:00.\n\nFinally, I'll format the output as required, making sure it's clean and includes both the time range and the day.\n\nI'll structure the code to loop through each day in the specified order, handle each day's busy intervals, and return the first available slot found.\n\nPotential edge cases to consider:\n- No gaps are available on the preferred days, so the script needs to check Tuesday.\n- The earliest gap is exactly at the start of the day.\n- The gap is between two busy intervals.\n\nI'll make sure the code handles these cases gracefully.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the busy intervals for Terry and Frances for each day\n    terry_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(10, 30, 11, 0), (12, 30, 14, 0), (15, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 30, 10, 0), (10, 30, 11, 0), (14, 0, 14, 30), (16, 0, 16, 30)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9, 30, 10, 30), (11, 0, 12, 0), (13, 0, 13, 30), (15, 0, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Thursday\": [(9, 30, 10, 0), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 14, 30), (16, 0, 16, 30)],\n        \"Friday\": [(9, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 30, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    frances_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 30, 11, 0), (11, 30, 13, 0), (14, 0, 14, 30), (15, 0, 16, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (10, 0, 10, 30), (11, 0, 12, 0), (13, 0, 14, 30), (15, 30, 16, 30)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9, 30, 10, 0), (10, 30, 11, 0), (11, 30, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Thursday\": [(11, 0, 12, 30), (14, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Friday\": [(9, 30, 10, 30), (11, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Tuesday\"]  # Prioritize Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday over Tuesday\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes in minutes\n\n    for day in days:\n        terry_busy = terry_schedule[day]\n        frances_busy = frances_schedule[day]\n\n        # Combine and sort busy intervals\n        combined_busy = sorted(terry_busy + frances_busy, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        current_time = start_time\n        for busy_start, busy_end in combined_busy:\n            start = busy_start[0] * 60 + busy_start[1]\n            end = busy_end[0] * 60 + busy_end[1]\n            if current_time + meeting_duration <= start:\n                # Found a slot\n                meeting_start = current_time\n                meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n                return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n            current_time = max(current_time, end)\n\n        # Check if there's time after the last busy interval\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            meeting_start = current_time\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
