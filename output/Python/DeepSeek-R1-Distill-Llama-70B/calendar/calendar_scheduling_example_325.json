            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to find a suitable time for a meeting with Jose, Keith, Logan, Megan, Gary, and Bobby on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The meeting should be half an hour long, and there's a constraint that Jose doesn't want to meet after 15:30. Let me go through each person's schedule step by step to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each participant's busy times:\n\n- **Jose**: 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00\n- **Keith**: 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30\n- **Logan**: 9:00-10:00, 12:00-12:30, 15:00-15:30\n- **Megan**: 9:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-16:30\n- **Gary**: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-16:30\n- **Bobby**: 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-16:00\n\nNow, I'll look for overlapping free times in their schedules.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n\n- **9:00-10:00**: Logan is busy. So, not available.\n- **10:00-11:00**: Megan and Gary are busy. Not available.\n- **11:00-12:00**: Jose, Megan, and Bobby are busy. Not available.\n- **12:00-13:00**: Logan and Bobby are busy. Not available.\n- **13:00-14:00**: Megan, Gary, and Bobby are busy. Not available.\n- **14:00-15:00**: Keith is busy from 14:00-14:30, and Megan, Gary, and Bobby are busy until 16:30. So, the only possible slot here is 14:30-15:00, but let me check:\n\nAt **14:30-15:00**:\n- Jose: Free (since his last meeting is at 12:30-13:00 and he doesn't want to meet after 15:30)\n- Keith: Free until 15:00\n- Logan: Free (his busy times are 9:00-10:00, 12:00-12:30, 15:00-15:30)\n- Megan: Busy until 16:30, so not available\n- Gary: Busy until 16:30, so not available\n- Bobby: Busy until 16:00\n\nSince Megan and Gary are busy until 16:30, this slot doesn't work.\n\nNext, **15:00-15:30**:\n- Jose: He doesn't want to meet after 15:30, so this is the latest he's available.\n- Keith: Busy from 15:00-15:30\n- Logan: Busy from 15:00-15:30\n- Megan: Busy until 16:30\n- Gary: Busy until 16:30\n- Bobby: Busy until 16:00\n\nSo, Keith and Logan are busy here, and Megan, Gary, and Bobby are also busy. This slot doesn't work.\n\nLet me check if there's any other slot I might have missed.\n\nLooking back, maybe there's a slot between 10:30-11:00. Let's see:\n\n- **10:30-11:00**:\n  - Jose: Free (his meetings are at 11:00-11:30 and 12:30-13:00)\n  - Keith: Free (his meetings start at 14:00)\n  - Logan: Free (his busy times are 9:00-10:00, 12:00-12:30, 15:00-15:30)\n  - Megan: Busy until 11:00, so she's free at 11:00, but the slot is until 11:00, so she might be available right at 11:00.\n  - Gary: Busy until 10:30, so he's free at 10:30.\n  - Bobby: Busy from 11:00-11:30, so he's free until 11:00.\n\nBut Megan is busy until 11:00, so she can't make it at 10:30-11:00. Therefore, this slot doesn't work.\n\nAnother possible slot could be **13:30-14:00**:\n\n- Jose: Free\n- Keith: Free until 14:00\n- Logan: Free\n- Megan: Busy until 13:30, so she's free at 13:30, but the slot starts at 13:30.\n- Gary: Busy until 14:00\n- Bobby: Busy until 16:00\n\nGary is busy until 14:00, so this slot doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe **12:30-13:00**:\n\n- Jose: Busy from 12:30-13:00\n- Keith: Free\n- Logan: Busy until 12:30\n- Megan: Busy until 13:30\n- Gary: Busy until 14:00\n- Bobby: Busy until 16:00\n\nJose is busy here, so this slot is out.\n\nLet me check **16:00-16:30**:\n\n- Jose: He doesn't want to meet after 15:30, so this is too late.\n- Keith: Free after 15:30\n- Logan: Busy until 15:30\n- Megan: Busy until 16:30\n- Gary: Busy until 16:30\n- Bobby: Busy until 16:00\n\nThis slot doesn't work because Jose won't meet after 15:30, and others are busy.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me list all possible 30-minute slots and check each one.\n\n- **9:00-9:30**: Logan is busy.\n- **9:30-10:00**: Megan and Gary are busy.\n- **10:00-10:30**: Megan and Gary are busy.\n- **10:30-11:00**: Megan is busy until 11:00, so she can't make it.\n- **11:00-11:30**: Jose, Megan, and Bobby are busy.\n- **11:30-12:00**: Gary is busy until 13:00, so he's busy here.\n- **12:00-12:30**: Logan and Bobby are busy.\n- **12:30-13:00**: Jose is busy.\n- **13:00-13:30**: Megan, Gary, and Bobby are busy.\n- **13:30-14:00**: Gary is busy until 14:00.\n- **14:00-14:30**: Keith is busy.\n- **14:30-15:00**: Keith is free, but Megan, Gary, and Bobby are busy until 16:30.\n- **15:00-15:30**: Keith and Logan are busy, and Megan, Gary, and Bobby are still busy.\n- **15:30-16:00**: Jose doesn't want to meet after 15:30, and others are busy.\n- **16:00-16:30**: Jose's constraint, and others are busy.\n- **16:30-17:00**: Jose's constraint, and Megan and Gary are busy until 16:30.\n\nIt seems like there's no slot that works for everyone. But the problem states that there is a solution, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I overlooked a slot. Let's see:\n\nIs there a 30-minute window where all are free? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at **14:30-15:00**:\n\n- Jose: Free (his last meeting is at 12:30-13:00, and he's available until 15:30)\n- Keith: Busy until 14:30, so he's free at 14:30\n- Logan: Free (his busy times are 9:00-10:00, 12:00-12:30, 15:00-15:30)\n- Megan: Busy until 16:30\n- Gary: Busy until 16:30\n- Bobby: Busy until 16:00\n\nSo Megan, Gary, and Bobby are busy here. This slot doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe **13:00-13:30**:\n\n- Jose: Free\n- Keith: Free\n- Logan: Free\n- Megan: Busy until 13:30\n- Gary: Busy until 14:00\n- Bobby: Busy until 16:00\n\nMegan is busy until 13:30, Gary until 14:00, and Bobby until 16:00. So this slot doesn't work.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. The problem says there's a solution, so I must be missing something. Let me try a different approach by looking for overlapping free times.\n\nLet me list the free times for each person:\n\n- **Jose**: 9:00-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-15:30\n- **Keith**: 9:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00\n- **Logan**: 10:00-12:00, 12:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00\n- **Megan**: 10:30-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-14:30, 16:30-17:00\n- **Gary**: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 16:30-17:00\n- **Bobby**: 9:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 16:00-17:00\n\nNow, looking for a 30-minute window where all have free time.\n\nLooking at **10:30-11:00**:\n\n- Jose: Free\n- Keith: Free\n- Logan: Free\n- Megan: Free\n- Gary: Free\n- Bobby: Free until 11:00\n\nBut Megan is free only until 11:00, so this slot is possible. Wait, Megan is free from 10:30-11:00, and Bobby is free until 11:00. So this slot might work.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n- **10:30-11:00**:\n  - Jose: Free\n  - Keith: Free\n  - Logan: Free\n  - Megan: Free\n  - Gary: Free\n  - Bobby: Free\n\nYes, this slot is free for everyone. I must have missed this earlier. So the meeting can be scheduled at 10:30-11:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each participant\n    schedules = {\n        \"Jose\": [(11, 0, 11, 30), (12, 30, 13, 0)],\n        \"Keith\": [(14, 0, 14, 30), (15, 0, 15, 30)],\n        \"Logan\": [(9, 0, 10, 0), (12, 0, 12, 30), (15, 0, 15, 30)],\n        \"Megan\": [(9, 0, 10, 30), (11, 0, 12, 0), (13, 0, 13, 30), (14, 30, 16, 30)],\n        \"Gary\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (10, 0, 10, 30), (11, 30, 13, 0), (13, 30, 14, 0), (14, 30, 16, 30)],\n        \"Bobby\": [(11, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 16, 0)]\n    }\n\n    # Convert time ranges to minutes since midnight for easier calculations\n    def time_to_minutes(hours, minutes):\n        return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n    # Check each possible time slot\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n\n    # Iterate through each 30-minute slot\n    while start_time < end_time:\n        current_end = start_time + 30\n        if current_end > end_time:\n            current_end = end_time\n\n        # Convert start and end times back to HH:MM format\n        start_hh, start_mm = divmod(start_time, 60)\n        end_hh, end_mm = divmod(current_end, 60)\n\n        # Check if this time slot works for everyone\n        works_for_all = True\n        for name, schedule in schedules.items():\n            for meeting in schedule:\n                meeting_start = time_to_minutes(meeting[0], meeting[1])\n                meeting_end = time_to_minutes(meeting[2], meeting[3])\n                \n                # Check overlap\n                if not (current_end <= meeting_start or start_time >= meeting_end):\n                    works_for_all = False\n                    break\n            if not works_for_all:\n                break\n\n        if works_for_all:\n            return f\"Monday: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}-{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        \n        start_time += 30  # Move to the next 30-minute slot\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
