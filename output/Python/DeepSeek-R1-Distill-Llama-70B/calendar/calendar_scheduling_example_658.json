            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I'm trying to help Shirley and Albert schedule a meeting. Let's see what the task says. They need to meet for half an hour between 9 AM and 5 PM on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nFirst, I'll look at their schedules. Shirley is busy on Monday from 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, and 16:00 to 16:30. On Tuesday, she's busy from 9:30 to 10:00. Albert is pretty busy on Monday all day from 9 AM to 5 PM. On Tuesday, he's busy from 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. \n\nShirley prefers not to meet on Tuesday after 10:30. So, I need to find a time that works for both of them, considering their preferences.\n\nLet's start with Monday. Albert is fully booked the entire day, so Monday is out of the question. That leaves us with Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Shirley is only busy until 10:00. After that, she's free. Albert is busy from 9:30 to 11:00, then again from 11:30 to 12:30, and so on. So, the earliest time after 10:00 when both are free would be right after Shirley's last meeting on Tuesday, which is at 10:00. But Albert is busy until 11:00, so the earliest they can meet is after 11:00.\n\nWait, Shirley doesn't want to meet after 10:30 on Tuesday. So, the latest she's willing to meet is 10:30. But Albert is busy until 11:00, so they can't meet between 10:00 and 10:30 because Albert isn't available until 11:00. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for a slot after 11:00 but before 11:30 when both are free. Let's see. Albert is free from 11:00 to 11:30. Shirley is free after 10:00. So, from 11:00 to 11:30, both are available. Since the meeting is half an hour, 11:00 to 11:30 would work perfectly. \n\nBut wait, the preference was for Shirley not to meet after 10:30. Does 11:00 count as after 10:30? Yes, it does. So, maybe I need to adjust. Perhaps the meeting can start at 10:30, but Shirley doesn't want to meet after that. So, 10:30 is the latest she's comfortable with. \n\nBut Albert is busy until 11:00, so the earliest they can meet is at 11:00. That seems to be the only slot where both are available, but it's after Shirley's preferred time. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If Shirley doesn't want to meet after 10:30, then the latest she wants to start is 10:30. So, the meeting would need to be from 10:30 to 11:00. But Albert is busy until 11:00, so that slot is taken. \n\nIs there any other time? Let's see. On Tuesday, after 11:00, Albert is busy again at 11:30. So, from 11:00 to 11:30, both are free. But that's after 10:30, which Shirley prefers not to. \n\nHmm, maybe the only available slot is from 11:00 to 11:30, even though it's after Shirley's preferred time. Since it's the only option, and the problem states there's a solution, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9,\n        \"end\": 17\n    }\n\n    # Define participants' schedules\n    shirley_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [[10.5, 11], [12, 12.5], [16, 16.5]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[9.5, 10]]\n    }\n\n    albert_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [[9, 17]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[9.5, 11], [11.5, 12.5], [13, 16], [16.5, 17]]\n    }\n\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    meeting_duration = 0.5  # In hours (30 minutes)\n\n    # Define the days to check\n    days_to_check = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\"]\n\n    # Shirley's preference: rather not meet on Tuesday after 10:30\n    shirley_preference = {\n        \"Tuesday\": 10.5\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through each day\n    for day in days_to_check:\n        # Combine and sort all busy intervals for both participants\n        shirley_busy = shirley_schedule[day]\n        albert_busy = albert_schedule[day]\n        all_busy = sorted(shirley_busy + albert_busy, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n        # Initialize previous end time to work hours start\n        prev_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n\n        # Apply Shirley's preference for Tuesday\n        if day == \"Tuesday\" and prev_end < shirley_preference[day]:\n            prev_end = shirley_preference[day]\n\n        # Iterate through each busy interval\n        for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n            # Check for available slot before the busy interval starts\n            if busy_start - prev_end >= meeting_duration:\n                # Format the time slots\n                start_time = prev_end\n                end_time = prev_end + meeting_duration\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_hh = int(start_time)\n                start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n                end_hh = int(end_time)\n                end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n                # Return the earliest available time\n                return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on {day}\"\n            \n            # Update previous end time\n            prev_end = max(prev_end, busy_end)\n\n        # Check for available slot after the last busy interval\n        if work_hours[\"end\"] - prev_end >= meeting_duration:\n            start_time = prev_end\n            end_time = prev_end + meeting_duration\n            start_hh = int(start_time)\n            start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n            end_hh = int(end_time)\n            end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n            return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
