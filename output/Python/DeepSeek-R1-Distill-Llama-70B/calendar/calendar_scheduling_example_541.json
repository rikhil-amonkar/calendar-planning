Both have certain parts of their day blocked, and I need to find a time that works for both.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the blocked times for each person to get a clear picture.\n\n**Kayla's Schedule:**\n- 10:00 to 10:30\n- 14:30 to 16:00\n\n**Rebecca's Schedule:**\n- 9:00 to 13:00\n- 13:30 to 15:00\n- 15:30 to 16:00\n\nNow, I need to find a one-hour slot where neither Kayla nor Rebecca has a conflict. Let's break down the day into possible time slots and see where there's an overlap of availability.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n- **9:00 to 10:00:** Rebecca is busy until 13:00, so this slot is out.\n- **10:00 to 10:30:** Kayla is busy, so this is also out.\n- **10:30 to 13:00:** Rebecca is busy, so no go.\n- **13:00 to 13:30:** Rebecca is free until 13:30, but Kayla is free here. However, Rebecca becomes busy again at 13:30.\n- **13:30 to 14:30:** Rebecca is busy until 15:00, so this slot is out.\n- **14:30 to 15:00:** Both Kayla and Rebecca are busy, so this is out.\n- **15:00 to 15:30:** Kayla is busy until 16:00, so this is out.\n- **15:30 to 16:00:** Rebecca is busy, so this is out.\n- **16:00 to 17:00:** Kayla is busy until 16:00, but after that, she's free. Rebecca is also free after 16:00.\n\nSo, looking at the available slots:\n- **16:00 to 17:00:** Both Kayla and Rebecca are free.\n\nThis seems like the only slot where both are available for a full hour. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other possible slots.\n\nWait, what about between 13:00 and 13:30? Rebecca is free from 13:00 to 13:30, and Kayla is free until 14:30. So, 13:00 to 14:00 would actually work. Let me adjust that.\n\nSo, the available slots are:\n- **13:00 to 14:00**\n- **16:00 to 17:00**\n\nSince the user prefers the earliest available time, **13:00 to 14:00** would be the best choice.\n\nNow, I'll write a Python script to implement this logic. The script will take the schedules of both participants, combine their busy intervals, and find the earliest available slot that fits the meeting duration.\n\nI'll make sure the script is clean and well-formatted, as per the instructions. It should output the time range in HH:MM:HH:MM format and the day of the week.\n\nLet me outline the steps the script will follow:\n1. **Define the busy intervals** for both Kayla and Rebecca.\n2. **Combine and sort** these intervals to check for overlapping busy times.\n3. **Iterate through the sorted intervals** to find gaps where both are free.\n4. **Check the gaps** to see if they can accommodate the one-hour meeting.\n5. **Return the earliest available time slot** in the required format.\n\nI'll make sure to handle the time conversions correctly, from hours and minutes to total minutes since midnight, to simplify the comparisons.\n\nOnce the script is written, I'll test it to ensure it correctly identifies the available slots and selects the earliest one.\n\nAlright, let's put this into code.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the busy intervals for Kayla and Rebecca in minutes since midnight\n    kayla_busy = [(10 * 60 + 0, 10 * 60 + 30),  # 10:00 to 10:30\n                  (14 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60 + 0)]  # 14:30 to 16:00\n\n    rebecca_busy = [(9 * 60 + 0, 13 * 60 + 0),   # 9:00 to 13:00\n                    (13 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60 + 0),  # 13:30 to 15:00\n                    (15 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60 + 0)]  # 15:30 to 16:00\n\n    day = \"Monday\"\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    # Combine and sort all busy intervals\n    all_busy = kayla_busy + rebecca_busy\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Check for available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start:\n            # Found a slot\n            meeting_start = current_time\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n        current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n    # Check if there's time after the last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        meeting_start = current_time\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n        return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
