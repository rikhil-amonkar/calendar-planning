            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to schedule a meeting for Emily, Melissa, and Frank on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The meeting should be half an hour long. Let me look at each person's schedule to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, Emily is busy from 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30. So, she's free before 10:00, between 10:30 and 11:30, between 12:30 and 14:00, and after 15:00 until 16:00, and after 16:30.\n\nMelissa is busy from 9:30 to 10:00 and 14:30 to 15:00. So, she's free before 9:30, between 10:00 and 14:30, and after 15:00.\n\nFrank has more restrictions. He's busy from 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. Additionally, Frank doesn't want to meet after 9:30 on Monday. So, Frank is only available before 9:30.\n\nNow, considering Frank's preference to not meet after 9:30, I need to find a time before 9:30 that works for everyone.\n\nLooking at Emily's schedule, she's free before 10:00, which includes the time before 9:30. Melissa is also free before 9:30. So, the only available time that fits everyone's schedule and Frank's preference is between 9:00 and 9:30.\n\nSince the meeting needs to be half an hour long, the only possible time slot is from 9:00 to 9:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours as a list of possible time slots in minutes\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9 * 60,  # 9:00 in minutes\n        \"end\": 17 * 60    # 17:00 in minutes\n    }\n\n    # Participants' schedules in minutes\n    participants = {\n        \"Emily\": [\n            (10*60, 10*60 + 30),     # 10:00-10:30\n            (11*60 + 30, 12*60 + 30),# 11:30-12:30\n            (14*60, 15*60),          # 14:00-15:00\n            (16*60, 16*60 + 30)      # 16:00-16:30\n        ],\n        \"Melissa\": [\n            (9*60 + 30, 10*60),      # 9:30-10:00\n            (14*60 + 30, 15*60)      # 14:30-15:00\n        ],\n        \"Frank\": [\n            (10*60, 10*60 + 30),     # 10:00-10:30\n            (11*60, 11*60 + 30),     # 11:00-11:30\n            (12*60 + 30, 13*60),     # 12:30-13:00\n            (13*60 + 30, 14*60 + 30),# 13:30-14:30\n            (15*60, 16*60),          # 15:00-16:00\n            (16*60 + 30, 17*60)      # 16:30-17:00\n        ]\n    }\n\n    # Frank's preference: no meetings after 9:30\n    frank_preference = 9*60 + 30  # 9:30 in minutes\n\n    # Convert time in minutes to HH:MM format\n    def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n        return f\"{minutes // 60:02d}:{minutes % 60:02d}\"\n\n    # Check each 30-minute slot within work hours, considering Frank's preference\n    for hour in range(work_hours[\"start\"], work_hours[\"end\"] + 1):\n        for minute in [0, 30]:\n            start = hour * 60 + minute\n            end = start + 30\n\n            # Skip if the slot goes beyond work hours or after Frank's preferred time\n            if end > work_hours[\"end\"] * 60 or start >= frank_preference:\n                continue\n\n            # Check availability for all participants\n            is_available = True\n            for name, schedule in participants.items():\n                for busy_start, busy_end in schedule:\n                    # Check if the current slot overlaps with any busy time\n                    if not (end <= busy_start or start >= busy_end):\n                        is_available = False\n                        break\n                if not is_available:\n                    break\n\n            if is_available:\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_time = f\"{start // 60:02d}:{start % 60:02d}\"\n                end_time = f\"{end // 60:02d}:{end % 60:02d}\"\n                return f\"{start_time}:{end_time}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(f\"The proposed meeting time is {meeting_time} on Monday.\")\n```",
