The meeting needs to be an hour long, and everyone's available between 9 AM and 5 PM. Let me look at their schedules first.\n\nRyan is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 and from 12:30 to 13:00. So, Ryan is free from 9:30 to 12:30 and then from 13:00 onwards.\n\nRuth has no meetings the whole day, so she's available all day.\n\nDenise is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, and 14:30 to 16:30. Denise also doesn't want to meet after 12:30 PM. So, Denise is available from 10:30 to 12:00 and then from 13:00 to 14:30, but she prefers not to meet after 12:30 PM.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that works for all three. Let's see:\n\nFrom 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM: Ryan is free, Ruth is free, Denise is free until 12:00 PM. So, this slot works because Denise is available until 12:00 PM, and the meeting would end at 11:30 AM.\n\nAlternatively, from 13:00 PM to 14:00 PM: Ryan is free, Ruth is free, and Denise is free until 14:30 PM. But Denise doesn't want to meet after 12:30 PM, so this slot might not be ideal.\n\nConsidering Denise's preference to not meet after 12:30 PM, the best time would be from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes and meeting duration\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n    duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    # Define busy intervals for each participant in minutes\n    schedules = {\n        \"Ryan\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [12*60+30, 13*60]],\n        \"Ruth\": [],\n        \"Denise\": [[9*60+30, 10*60+30], [12*60, 13*60], [14*60+30, 16*60+30]]\n    }\n\n    # Denise's preference: do not meet after 12:30\n    latest_preferred_start = 12 * 60 + 30  # 12:30 in minutes\n\n    # Check each possible time slot\n    for time in range(work_start, work_end - duration + 1):\n        # Convert time to HH:MM format\n        current_time = time\n        end_slot = time + duration\n\n        # Check availability for all participants\n        available = True\n        for person, busy_times in schedules.items():\n            for busy_start, busy_end in busy_times:\n                # Check if the current slot overlaps with any busy time\n                if not (end_slot <= busy_start or current_time >= busy_end):\n                    available = False\n                    break\n            if not available:\n                break\n\n        # Additional check for Denise's preference\n        if available and current_time > latest_preferred_start:\n            available = False\n\n        if available:\n            # Convert time to HH:MM format\n            start_hour = current_time // 60\n            start_minute = current_time % 60\n            end_hour = end_slot // 60\n            end_minute = end_slot % 60\n\n            # Format the output\n            return f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per the problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
