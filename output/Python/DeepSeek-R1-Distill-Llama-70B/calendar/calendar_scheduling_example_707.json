The user wants to schedule a meeting between Ryan and Adam for half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the constraints:\n\n1. **Ryan's Availability:**\n   - **Monday:** Busy from 9:30-10:00, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:30-16:00.\n   - **Tuesday:** Busy from 11:30-12:30, 15:30-16:00.\n   - **Wednesday:** Busy from 12:00-13:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n   - **Note:** Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday.\n\n2. **Adam's Availability:**\n   - **Monday:** Busy from 9:00-10:30, 11:00-13:30, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n   - **Tuesday:** Busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n   - **Wednesday:** Busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n   - **Note:** Adam prefers to avoid meetings on Monday before 14:30.\n\n3. **Preferences:**\n   - Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday.\n   - Adam wants to avoid meetings on Monday before 14:30.\n\nGiven these constraints, I'll need to find a time slot where both Ryan and Adam are free. Since Ryan can't meet on Wednesday, we'll focus on Monday and Tuesday.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Monday**\n\n- **Ryan's Free Slots on Monday:**\n  - 9:00-9:30\n  - 10:00-11:00\n  - 12:00-13:00\n  - 13:30-15:30\n  - 16:00-17:00\n\n- **Adam's Free Slots on Monday:**\n  - 10:30-11:00\n  - 13:30-14:00\n  - 16:00-16:30\n\n- **Overlap on Monday:**\n  - 10:30-11:00 (30 minutes)\n  - 13:30-14:00 (30 minutes)\n  - 16:00-16:30 (30 minutes)\n\nHowever, Adam wants to avoid meetings before 14:30 on Monday. So, the only viable slot on Monday would be after 14:30, but looking at their schedules, there's no overlap after 14:30 that fits both.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Tuesday**\n\n- **Ryan's Free Slots on Tuesday:**\n  - 9:00-11:30\n  - 12:30-15:30\n  - 16:00-17:00\n\n- **Adam's Free Slots on Tuesday:**\n  - 10:00-10:30\n  - 15:30-16:00\n\n- **Overlap on Tuesday:**\n  - 10:00-10:30 (30 minutes)\n  - 15:30-16:00 (30 minutes)\n\nBoth of these slots fit within the meeting duration requirement of 30 minutes.\n\n**Step 3: Choose the Earliest Availability**\n\nThe user prefers the earliest possible time. Between the two options on Tuesday, 10:00-10:30 is earlier than 15:30-16:00.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe earliest available time that works for both Ryan and Adam, considering all constraints, is Tuesday from 10:00 to 10:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    ryan_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9.5*60, 10*60), (11*60, 12*60), (13*60, 13.5*60), (15.5*60, 16*60)],\n        'Tuesday': [(11.5*60, 12.5*60), (15.5*60, 16*60)],\n        'Wednesday': [(12*60, 13*60), (15.5*60, 16*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    adam_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 10.5*60), (11*60, 13.5*60), (14*60, 16*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)],\n        'Tuesday': [(9*60, 10*60), (10.5*60, 15.5*60), (16*60, 17*60)],\n        'Wednesday': [(9*60, 9.5*60), (10*60, 11*60), (11.5*60, 14.5*60), (15*60, 15.5*60), (16*60, 16.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday']  # Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    for day in days:\n        # Get busy intervals for both participants on the current day\n        ryan_busy = ryan_schedule.get(day, [])\n        adam_busy = adam_schedule.get(day, [])\n\n        # Combine and sort all busy intervals\n        all_busy = []\n        for interval in ryan_busy:\n            all_busy.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Ryan'))\n        for interval in adam_busy:\n            all_busy.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Adam'))\n\n        all_busy.sort()\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        current_time = start_time\n        for busy_start, busy_end, person in all_busy:\n            if current_time < busy_start:\n                # Found an available slot\n                if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                    # Format the time\n                    start_h = current_time // 60\n                    start_m = current_time % 60\n                    end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                    end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n                    \n                    # Convert to HH:MM format\n                    start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                    end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n                    \n                    print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                    return\n            current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n        # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            start_h = current_time // 60\n            start_m = current_time % 60\n            end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n            end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n            \n            start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n            end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n            \n            print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n            return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
