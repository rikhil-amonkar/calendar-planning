The meeting should last one hour, and it has to be between 9:00 and 17:00. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each person's schedule to see when they're busy.\n\nAnthony is busy from 9:30-10:00, 12:00-13:00, and 16:00-16:30. So he's free before 9:30, between 10:00 and 12:00, 13:00 to 16:00, and after 16:30.\n\nPamela is busy from 9:30-10:00 and 16:30-17:00. She also mentioned she doesn't want to meet after 14:30 on Monday. So her available times are between 10:00 and 14:30.\n\nZachary has a lot of meetings: 9:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, and 16:00-17:00. His free slots are between 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:30, and 15:00-16:00.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that fits all three. Let's look for overlapping free times.\n\nStarting with Anthony and Pamela's availability:\n\nAnthony: 10:00-12:00, 13:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\nPamela: 10:00-14:30\n\nSo their overlap is 10:00-14:30.\n\nNow, check Zachary's availability within this overlap:\n\nZachary is free from 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:30.\n\nSo the possible times when all three are free are:\n\n11:30-12:00 (but the meeting needs to be an hour, so this is too short)\n12:30-13:00 (also too short)\n13:30-14:30 (this is exactly one hour)\n\nSo the only suitable time is from 13:30 to 14:30.\n\nI should make sure this time doesn't conflict with Pamela's preference to not meet after 14:30. Since the meeting ends at 14:30, it's acceptable.\n\nThus, the meeting can be scheduled from 13:30 to 14:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    start_time = \"09:00\"\n    end_time = \"17:00\"\n    \n    # Define participants' busy intervals as dictionaries with name and time ranges\n    participants = {\n        \"Anthony\": [\n            (\"09:30\", \"10:00\"),\n            (\"12:00\", \"13:00\"),\n            (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")\n        ],\n        \"Pamela\": [\n            (\"09:30\", \"10:00\"),\n            (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")\n        ],\n        \"Zachary\": [\n            (\"09:00\", \"11:30\"),\n            (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n            (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"),\n            (\"14:30\", \"15:00\"),\n            (\"16:00\", \"17:00\")\n        ]\n    }\n    \n    # Convert time strings to minutes since midnight for easier comparison\n    def time_to_minutes(time_str):\n        hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n        return hours * 60 + mins\n    \n    # Convert all busy intervals to minutes\n    busy_intervals = {}\n    for name, intervals in participants.items():\n        busy = []\n        for start, end in intervals:\n            busy_start = time_to_minutes(start)\n            busy_end = time_to_minutes(end)\n            busy.append((busy_start, busy_end))\n        busy_intervals[name] = busy\n    \n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 60\n    \n    # Generate all possible time slots within work hours\n    work_start = time_to_minutes(start_time)\n    work_end = time_to_minutes(end_time)\n    \n    # Find all available time slots for each participant\n    available_slots = {}\n    for name, intervals in busy_intervals.items():\n        available = []\n        previous_end = work_start\n        \n        # Add available slots before the first busy interval\n        if intervals and intervals[0][0] > previous_end:\n            available.append((previous_end, intervals[0][0]))\n        \n        # Add available slots between busy intervals\n        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):\n            current_start = intervals[i-1][1]\n            next_start = intervals[i][0]\n            if current_start < next_start:\n                available.append((current_start, next_start))\n        \n        # Add available slots after the last busy interval\n        if intervals:\n            last_end = intervals[-1][1]\n            if last_end < work_end:\n                available.append((last_end, work_end))\n        else:\n            # If no busy intervals, the entire work time is available\n            available.append((work_start, work_end))\n        \n        available_slots[name] = available\n    \n    # Find overlapping available slots that can accommodate the meeting duration\n    anthony_available = available_slots[\"Anthony\"]\n    pamela_available = available_slots[\"Pamela\"]\n    zachary_available = available_slots[\"Zachary\"]\n    \n    overlapping_slots = []\n    for a_slot in anthony_available:\n        for p_slot in pamela_available:\n            for z_slot in zachary_available:\n                # Find the overlapping start and end\n                start = max(a_slot[0], p_slot[0], z_slot[0])\n                end = min(a_slot[1], p_slot[1], z_slot[1])\n                \n                if end - start >= meeting_duration:\n                    overlapping_slots.append((start, end))\n    \n    # Convert the first available overlapping slot back to HH:MM format\n    if overlapping_slots:\n        meeting_start, meeting_end = overlapping_slots[0]\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            hours = minutes // 60\n            mins = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{hours:02d}:{mins:02d}\"\n        \n        meeting_start_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_start)\n        meeting_end_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n        day = \"Monday\"\n        return f\"{meeting_start_str}:{meeting_end_str}:{day}\"\n    else:\n        return \"No available time slot found that accommodates everyone.\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
