            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to help Jean and Doris find a suitable time for their meeting. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the meeting is supposed to be half an hour long, between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. Both participants have busy schedules, so I need to find a time slot where both are free.\n\nLooking at Jean's schedule: On Tuesday, she's busy from 11:30 to 12:00 and 16:00 to 16:30. So, on Tuesday, her available times would be from 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nDoris's schedule is a bit more complicated. On Monday, she has meetings from 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. That leaves some gaps on Monday. Specifically, she's free from 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, and 16:00 to 16:30. But wait, Doris prefers not to meet on Monday after 14:00. So, any time after 14:00 on Monday is out of the question for her.\n\nNow, let's consider Tuesday. Doris is completely booked all day, from 9:00 to 17:00. So, Tuesday is not an option for Doris, meaning the meeting has to be on Monday.\n\nGiven that, I need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday where both Jean and Doris are free, and it's before 14:00.\n\nLooking at Monday, Doris is free from 11:30 to 12:00, which is only 30 minutes. But Jean's schedule on Monday isn't provided, so I assume she's available the entire day except where specified. Wait, no\u2014Jean's busy times are only specified for Tuesday. So on Monday, Jean is free all day from 9:00 to 17:00.\n\nSo, on Monday, Doris is free from 11:30 to 12:00. That's exactly a 30-minute window. So that could be a possible time. But wait, the meeting needs to be scheduled for half an hour. So 11:30 to 12:00 is perfect.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Doris is available from 11:30 to 12:00 on Monday, and Jean is available all day Monday. So that slot works for both. Also, since it's before 14:00, it respects Doris's preference.\n\nAlternatively, there's another slot from 12:30 to 13:30, but that's an hour. Since the meeting is only 30 minutes, we could pick 12:30 to 13:00 or 12:45 to 13:15, etc. But the earliest possible time is usually preferred unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, but the solution provided in the example was 14:30 to 15:30 on Tuesday. Wait, that can't be right because Doris is busy all day Tuesday. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, the example solution was for a different scenario. Let me focus on the current problem.\n\nWait, in the problem, the user provided an example task and solution, but the actual problem is different. So in this case, the meeting is between Jean and Doris, with the constraints as given.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nIn the problem, Doris is busy on Monday during 9:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So her free times on Monday are 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nBut she prefers not to meet after 14:00 on Monday. So the 16:00 slot is after 14:00, which she'd rather avoid. So the available slots are 11:30-12:00 and 12:30-13:30, but the latter ends at 13:30, which is before 14:00, so that's acceptable.\n\nWait, 12:30-13:30 is from 12:30 to 13:30, which is entirely before 14:00, so that's a possible slot. But the meeting needs to be 30 minutes, so 12:30-13:00 or 12:45-13:15, etc.\n\nWait, but 12:30-13:30 is a one-hour block, so any 30-minute slot within that would work. But since the meeting is exactly 30 minutes, perhaps the earliest available slot is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 11:30-12:00 slot is the best fit since it's a perfect 30-minute window.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The solution provided in the example was for a different scenario, but in the current problem, the solution should be on Monday. So perhaps the correct time is 11:30-12:00 on Monday.\n\nWait, but let me check Jean's availability again. On Monday, Jean's schedule isn't provided, so she's available all day except where specified. Since her busy times are only on Tuesday, she's free on Monday.\n\nSo, the possible times on Monday are:\n\n- 11:30-12:00 (Doris's free time)\n- 12:30-13:30 (Doris's free time)\n\nBut Doris prefers not to meet after 14:00, so both slots are before 14:00.\n\nSo, the earliest possible time would be 11:30-12:00.\n\nBut wait, the example solution was on Tuesday at 14:30, but that might have been a different scenario. In this case, Doris is busy all day Tuesday, so the meeting must be on Monday.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user provided an example task and solution, but the actual problem is different. So perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, no, the problem given is the one I need to solve, not the example. So in this case, the meeting is between Jean and Doris, with the constraints as given.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Meeting duration: 30 minutes\n- Days: Monday or Tuesday\n- Work hours: 9:00-17:00\n- Jean's availability:\n  - Monday: entirely free (since her busy times are only on Tuesday)\n  - Tuesday: busy 11:30-12:00 and 16:00-16:30\n- Doris's availability:\n  - Monday: free 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 16:00-16:30\n  - Tuesday: busy all day\n- Doris's preference: avoid Monday after 14:00\n\nSo, the possible days are Monday and Tuesday, but Doris is only available on Monday. So the meeting must be on Monday.\n\nOn Monday, Doris is free during 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, and 16:00-16:30. But she prefers not to meet after 14:00, so 16:00 is out.\n\nThus, the available slots are 11:30-12:00 and 12:30-13:30.\n\nSince the meeting is 30 minutes, 11:30-12:00 is a perfect fit. Alternatively, 12:30-13:00 is also possible.\n\nBut perhaps the earliest available time is preferred unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, the proposed time would be Monday, 11:30-12:00.\n\nWait, but in the example solution, it was on Tuesday at 14:30. That must have been a different scenario. In this case, Doris is busy all Tuesday, so the meeting can't be on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the correct time is Monday, 11:30-12:00.\n\nWait, but the example solution was for a different task, so in this case, the correct answer is Monday at 11:30.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The user provided an example task and solution, but the actual problem is different. So in the actual problem, the solution should be on Monday.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me outline the steps again.\n\n1. Identify all possible time slots for each day where both participants are free.\n\n2. Check against preferences.\n\n3. Select the earliest possible slot.\n\nSo, for Monday:\n\n- Jean is free all day.\n- Doris is free during 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nBut Doris doesn't want to meet after 14:00, so 16:00 is out.\n\nSo, possible slots:\n\n- 11:30-12:00 (30 minutes)\n- 12:30-13:30 (1 hour)\n\nSince the meeting is 30 minutes, the first slot is perfect.\n\nTherefore, the meeting should be scheduled on Monday from 11:30 to 12:00.\n\nWait, but in the example solution, the time was 14:30-15:30 on Tuesday. But in that example, perhaps the constraints were different. In this problem, Doris is busy all Tuesday, so that's not possible.\n\nSo, the correct answer is Monday, 11:30-12:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes since midnight\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00\n\n    # Define meeting duration in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Jean's busy intervals on Tuesday\n    jean_busy_tuesday = [\n        (11*60 + 30, 12*60),   # 11:30-12:00\n        (16*60, 16*60 + 30)    # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n\n    # Doris's busy intervals on Monday\n    doris_busy_monday = [\n        (9*60, 11*60 + 30),    # 9:00-11:30\n        (12*60, 12*60 + 30),   # 12:00-12:30\n        (13*60 + 30, 16*60),   # 13:30-16:00\n        (16*60 + 30, 17*60)    # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Doris's preference: avoid Monday after 14:00\n    doris_preference = 14 * 60  # 14:00\n\n    # Check Monday first\n    monday_start = work_start\n    monday_end = work_end\n\n    # Generate possible time slots for Monday\n    current_time = monday_start\n    while current_time < monday_end:\n        # Check if current_time is within Doris's preferred time\n        if current_time + meeting_duration > doris_preference:\n            break  # Doris prefers not to meet after 14:00\n\n        # Check if Jean is available on Monday (Jean has no meetings on Monday)\n        # Check if Doris is available at current_time\n        doris_available = True\n        for busy_start, busy_end in doris_busy_monday:\n            if current_time < busy_end and current_time + meeting_duration > busy_start:\n                doris_available = False\n                break\n\n        if doris_available:\n            # Found a suitable time\n            start_hour = current_time // 60\n            start_minute = current_time % 60\n            end_time = current_time + meeting_duration\n            end_hour = end_time // 60\n            end_minute = end_time % 60\n            return f\"Monday,{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}:{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n\n        current_time += 30  # Check every 30 minutes\n\n    # If no time found on Monday, check Tuesday\n    tuesday_start = work_start\n    tuesday_end = work_end\n\n    current_time = tuesday_start\n    while current_time < tuesday_end:\n        # Check if Jean is available on Tuesday\n        jean_available = True\n        for busy_start, busy_end in jean_busy_tuesday:\n            if current_time < busy_end and current_time + meeting_duration > busy_start:\n                jean_available = False\n                break\n\n        if not jean_available:\n            current_time += 30  # Skip this time slot\n            continue\n\n        # Check if Doris is available on Tuesday\n        # Doris is busy all day on Tuesday\n        doris_available = False\n        for busy_start, busy_end in [(work_start, work_end)]:\n            if current_time < busy_end and current_time + meeting_duration > busy_start:\n                doris_available = False\n                break\n        else:\n            doris_available = True\n\n        if doris_available:\n            start_hour = current_time // 60\n            start_minute = current_time % 60\n            end_time = current_time + meeting_duration\n            end_hour = end_time // 60\n            end_minute = end_time % 60\n            return f\"Tuesday,{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}:{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n\n        current_time += 30  # Check every 30 minutes\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
