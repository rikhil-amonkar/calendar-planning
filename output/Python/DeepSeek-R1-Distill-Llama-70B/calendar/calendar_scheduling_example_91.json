The challenge is to ensure that the proposed time slot doesn't conflict with any of their existing meetings and fits within the specified work hours.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each participant's schedule to have a clear view of their busy times:\n\n- **Danielle**:\n  - 9:00 to 10:00\n  - 10:30 to 11:00\n  - 14:30 to 15:00\n  - 15:30 to 16:00\n  - 16:30 to 17:00\n\n- **Bruce**:\n  - 11:00 to 11:30\n  - 12:30 to 13:00\n  - 14:00 to 14:30\n  - 15:30 to 16:00\n\n- **Eric**:\n  - 9:00 to 9:30\n  - 10:00 to 11:00\n  - 11:30 to 13:00\n  - 14:30 to 15:30\n\nNext, I'll convert these time slots into minutes since midnight to make it easier to compare and calculate overlaps. This conversion will help in checking if a proposed meeting time overlaps with any of their busy periods.\n\nI'll start by checking each possible one-hour slot within the 9:00 to 17:00 window. I'll iterate through each 60-minute block and see if it fits without overlapping any of their meetings.\n\nI'll begin at 9:00 and move forward in one-hour increments. For each slot, I'll check against each participant's schedule to ensure there's no overlap. If a slot is free for all three, that's the time I'll propose.\n\nAfter checking each slot, I find that the time from 13:00 to 14:00 doesn't conflict with any of their schedules. Danielle is free between 12:00 and 14:30, except for her meeting at 14:30. Bruce has a meeting from 12:30 to 13:00 but is free after that until 14:00. Eric is also free between 13:00 and 14:30. So, 13:00 to 14:00 works perfectly for everyone.\n\nI'll structure the Python script to perform these checks systematically. It will convert time slots to minutes, iterate through possible meeting times, and validate each against all participants' schedules. Once a suitable slot is found, it will output the time in the required format.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each participant\n    schedules = {\n        \"Danielle\": [(9, 0, 10, 0), (10, 30, 11, 0), (14, 30, 15, 0), (15, 30, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Bruce\": [(11, 0, 11, 30), (12, 30, 13, 0), (14, 0, 14, 30), (15, 30, 16, 0)],\n        \"Eric\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (10, 0, 11, 0), (11, 30, 13, 0), (14, 30, 15, 30)]\n    }\n\n    # Convert time ranges to minutes since midnight for easier calculations\n    def time_to_minutes(hours, minutes):\n        return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n    # Check each possible time slot\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n\n    # Iterate through each hour-long slot\n    while start_time < end_time:\n        current_end = start_time + 60\n        if current_end > end_time:\n            current_end = end_time\n\n        # Convert start and end times back to HH:MM format\n        start_hh, start_mm = divmod(start_time, 60)\n        end_hh, end_mm = divmod(current_end, 60)\n\n        # Check if this time slot works for everyone\n        works_for_all = True\n        for name, schedule in schedules.items():\n            for meeting in schedule:\n                meeting_start = time_to_minutes(meeting[0], meeting[1])\n                meeting_end = time_to_minutes(meeting[2], meeting[3])\n                \n                # Check overlap\n                if not (current_end <= meeting_start or start_time >= meeting_end):\n                    works_for_all = False\n                    break\n            if not works_for_all:\n                break\n\n        if works_for_all:\n            return f\"Monday: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}-{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        \n        start_time += 60  # Move to the next hour-long slot\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
