Margaret doesn't want to meet before 14:30, so I need to focus on times after that.\n\nFirst, I'll list everyone's busy times:\n\n- **Shirley**: Busy from 10:30-11:00 and 12:00-12:30.\n- **Jacob**: Busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:30, and 14:30-15:00.\n- **Stephen**: Busy from 11:30-12:00 and 12:30-13:00.\n- **Margaret**: Busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, and 16:30-17:00. She prefers not to meet before 14:30.\n- **Mason**: Busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nNow, I'll look for a time after 14:30 when everyone is free. Let's check each person's availability after 14:30:\n\n- **Shirley**: Free after 12:30.\n- **Jacob**: Busy until 15:00.\n- **Stephen**: Free after 13:00.\n- **Margaret**: Free from 13:30-15:00.\n- **Mason**: Free from 14:30-16:30.\n\nLooking at the overlapping free times after 14:30, the earliest slot that works for everyone is from 15:00 to 15:30. Margaret is available, Jacob is free after 15:00, Stephen is free, Shirley is free, and Mason is available until 16:30.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 15:00 to 15:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    shirley_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(10.5*60, 11*60), (12*60, 12.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    jacob_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 9.5*60), (10*60, 10.5*60), (11*60, 11.5*60),\n                   (12.5*60, 13.5*60), (14.5*60, 15*60)]\n    }\n\n    stephen_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(11.5*60, 12*60), (12.5*60, 13*60)]\n    }\n\n    margaret_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 9.5*60), (10.5*60, 12.5*60), (13*60, 13.5*60),\n                   (15*60, 15.5*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    mason_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 10*60), (10.5*60, 11*60), (11.5*60, 12.5*60),\n                   (13*60, 13.5*60), (14*60, 14.5*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    day = 'Monday'\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    busy_intervals = []\n    for interval in shirley_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Shirley'))\n    for interval in jacob_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Jacob'))\n    for interval in stephen_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Stephen'))\n    for interval in margaret_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Margaret'))\n    for interval in mason_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Mason'))\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    busy_intervals.sort()\n\n    # Find available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end, person in busy_intervals:\n        if current_time < busy_start:\n            if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                # Found a suitable time\n                start_h = current_time // 60\n                start_m = current_time % 60\n                end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n                print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                return\n        current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n    # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        start_h = current_time // 60\n        start_m = current_time % 60\n        end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n        end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n        print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n        return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
