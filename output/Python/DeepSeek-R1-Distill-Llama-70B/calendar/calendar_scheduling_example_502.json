Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the task details. The meeting needs to be scheduled for Jack and Charlotte on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The meeting duration is half an hour, so 30 minutes. \n\nNext, I'll examine their schedules:\n\n- **Jack's Schedule:**\n  - Busy: 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 16:00-16:30\n  - Preference: Avoid meetings after 12:30.\n\n- **Charlotte's Schedule:**\n  - Busy: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-16:00\n\nThe goal is to find a 30-minute slot where both are free, and it should not be after 12:30 for Jack.\n\nI'll start by converting all time strings into minutes since midnight to make comparisons easier. For example, 9:00 is 540 minutes, and 17:00 is 1020 minutes.\n\nNext, I'll create a list of all busy intervals for both Jack and Charlotte. Then, I'll determine the available time slots by looking at the gaps between their busy times.\n\nFor Jack, considering his preference to avoid meetings after 12:30 (which is 750 minutes), I'll only look for available slots up to that time.\n\nI'll then find overlapping available slots where both Jack and Charlotte are free for at least 30 minutes. The overlapping slots are calculated by comparing each available slot of Jack with Charlotte's and finding the maximum start time and minimum end time.\n\nOnce I have the overlapping slots, I'll select the first one that meets the duration requirement. If there are multiple options, I'll choose the earliest one to ensure it's as early as possible and respects Jack's preference.\n\nFinally, I'll convert the selected time slot back into HH:MM format and output it along with the day of the week, which is Monday in this case.\n\nI'll make sure the script is clean and well-formatted, and it should run without any errors to provide the correct meeting time.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    start_time = \"09:00\"\n    end_time = \"17:00\"\n    \n    # Define participants' busy intervals as dictionaries with name and time ranges\n    participants = {\n        \"Jack\": [\n            (\"09:30\", \"10:30\"),\n            (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"),\n            (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"),\n            (\"14:00\", \"14:30\"),\n            (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")\n        ],\n        \"Charlotte\": [\n            (\"09:30\", \"10:00\"),\n            (\"10:30\", \"12:00\"),\n            (\"12:30\", \"13:30\"),\n            (\"14:00\", \"16:00\")\n        ]\n    }\n    \n    # Convert time strings to minutes since midnight for easier comparison\n    def time_to_minutes(time_str):\n        hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n        return hours * 60 + mins\n    \n    # Convert all busy intervals to minutes\n    busy_intervals = {}\n    for name, intervals in participants.items():\n        busy = []\n        for start, end in intervals:\n            busy_start = time_to_minutes(start)\n            busy_end = time_to_minutes(end)\n            busy.append((busy_start, busy_end))\n        busy_intervals[name] = busy\n    \n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Generate all possible time slots within work hours\n    work_start = time_to_minutes(start_time)\n    work_end = time_to_minutes(end_time)\n    \n    # Find all available time slots for each participant\n    available_slots = {}\n    for name, intervals in busy_intervals.items():\n        available = []\n        previous_end = work_start\n        \n        # Add available slots before the first busy interval\n        if intervals and intervals[0][0] > previous_end:\n            available.append((previous_end, intervals[0][0]))\n        \n        # Add available slots between busy intervals\n        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):\n            current_start = intervals[i-1][1]\n            next_start = intervals[i][0]\n            if current_start < next_start:\n                available.append((current_start, next_start))\n        \n        # Add available slots after the last busy interval\n        if intervals:\n            last_end = intervals[-1][1]\n            if last_end < work_end:\n                available.append((last_end, work_end))\n        else:\n            # If no busy intervals, the entire work time is available\n            available.append((work_start, work_end))\n        \n        available_slots[name] = available\n    \n    # Find overlapping available slots that can accommodate the meeting duration\n    jack_available = available_slots[\"Jack\"]\n    charlotte_available = available_slots[\"Charlotte\"]\n    \n    overlapping_slots = []\n    for jack_slot in jack_available:\n        for charlotte_slot in charlotte_available:\n            # Find the overlapping start and end\n            start = max(jack_slot[0], charlotte_slot[0])\n            end = min(jack_slot[1], charlotte_slot[1])\n            \n            if end - start >= meeting_duration:\n                overlapping_slots.append((start, end))\n    \n    # Convert the first available overlapping slot back to HH:MM format\n    if overlapping_slots:\n        meeting_start, meeting_end = overlapping_slots[0]\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            hours = minutes // 60\n            mins = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{hours:02d}:{mins:02d}\"\n        \n        meeting_start_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_start)\n        meeting_end_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n        day = \"Monday\"\n        return f\"{meeting_start_str}:{meeting_end_str}:{day}\"\n    else:\n        return \"No available time slot found that accommodates everyone.\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
