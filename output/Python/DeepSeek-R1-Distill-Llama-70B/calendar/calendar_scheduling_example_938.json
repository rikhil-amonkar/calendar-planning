Let me first understand the problem.\n\nThe meeting needs to be half an hour long, between 9 AM and 5 PM, from Monday to Friday. But Eric wants to avoid more meetings on Wednesday, so maybe we should try to find a time on another day if possible.\n\nFirst, I'll list out their busy times:\n\nEugene's schedule:\n- Monday: 11:00-12:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30\n- Wednesday: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-15:00\n- Thursday: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-12:30\n- Friday: 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30\n\nEric's schedule:\n- Monday: 9:00-17:00 (all day)\n- Tuesday: 9:00-17:00 (all day)\n- Wednesday: 9:00-11:30, 12:00-14:00, 14:30-16:30\n- Thursday: 9:00-17:00 (all day)\n- Friday: 9:00-11:00, 11:30-17:00\n\nAlright, so let's see day by day.\n\nMonday: Eugene is busy at 11:00-12:00, but Eric is busy all day. So no available time on Monday.\n\nTuesday: Eric is busy all day, so no meeting possible.\n\nWednesday: Eugene has several slots, but Eric is busy until 11:30, then 12:00-14:00, and 14:30-16:30. So the possible free slots for Eric are 14:00-14:30 and after 16:30, but Eugene is busy until 16:00-16:30. So maybe between 16:30 and 17:00? But Eugene is free then? Wait, Eugene on Wednesday is busy until 16:00-16:30, so after that, he's free. So from 16:30 to 17:00, but that's only 30 minutes. So maybe that's a possible time. But Eric prefers to avoid Wednesday, so let's see other days first.\n\nThursday: Eric is busy all day, so no meeting possible.\n\nFriday: Let's check both schedules.\n\nEugene on Friday is busy at 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30.\n\nEric on Friday is busy until 11:00, then 11:30-17:00.\n\nSo let's see the available slots on Friday:\n\nFrom 9:00 to 10:30: Eugene is free, Eric is busy until 11:00, so no.\n\nFrom 11:00 to 11:30: Eugene is free, Eric is free from 11:00 to 11:30. So that's a possible 30-minute slot from 11:00 to 11:30.\n\nWait, Eugene is busy at 10:30-11:00, so from 11:00, he's free until 12:00, but Eric is busy from 11:30 onwards. So the only available time on Friday is 11:00-11:30.\n\nThat seems to work. So the meeting can be scheduled on Friday from 11:00 to 11:30.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Eugene is busy at 10:30-11:00, so at 11:00 he's free. Eric is free from 11:00 to 11:30. So yes, that slot works.\n\nAlternatively, on Wednesday, there's a slot from 16:30 to 17:00, but Eric prefers to avoid Wednesday, so Friday is better.\n\nSo the proposed time is Friday, 11:00-11:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    eugene_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(11*60, 12*60), (13.5*60, 14*60), (14.5*60, 15*60), (16*60, 16.5*60)],\n        'Wednesday': [(9*60, 9.5*60), (11*60, 11.5*60), (12*60, 12.5*60), (13.5*60, 15*60)],\n        'Thursday': [(9.5*60, 10*60), (11*60, 12.5*60)],\n        'Friday': [(10.5*60, 11*60), (12*60, 12.5*60), (13*60, 13.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    eric_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 17*60)],\n        'Tuesday': [(9*60, 17*60)],\n        'Wednesday': [(9*60, 11.5*60), (12*60, 14*60), (14.5*60, 16.5*60)],\n        'Thursday': [(9*60, 17*60)],\n        'Friday': [(9*60, 11*60), (11.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    for day in days:\n        # Skip Wednesday if possible to accommodate Eric's preference\n        if day == 'Wednesday':\n            continue\n\n        # Get busy intervals for both participants on the current day\n        eugene_busy = eugene_schedule.get(day, [])\n        eric_busy = eric_schedule.get(day, [])\n\n        # Combine and sort all busy intervals\n        all_busy = []\n        for interval in eugene_busy:\n            all_busy.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Eugene'))\n        for interval in eric_busy:\n            all_busy.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Eric'))\n\n        all_busy.sort()\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        current_time = start_time\n        for busy_start, busy_end, person in all_busy:\n            if current_time < busy_start:\n                # Found an available slot\n                if busy_start -
