Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the meeting needs to be half an hour long, between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Both participants must be available during this time.\n\nLooking at Mary's schedule:\n- Tuesday: Busy from 10:00-10:30, 15:30-16:00, and 15:00-15:30 on Wednesday.\n- Wednesday: 9:30-10:00 and 15:00-15:30.\n- Thursday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30.\n\nAlexis's schedule is more extensive:\n- Monday: Blocked from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-16:30.\n- Tuesday: Busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n- Wednesday: 9:00-11:00, 11:30-17:00.\n- Thursday: 10:00-12:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nI need to find a time slot where both are free. Let me check each day starting from Monday.\n\nMonday: Mary's schedule isn't provided, so I assume she's free. Alexis is busy until 16:30, so the earliest free time after that would be 16:30, but the meeting needs to be 30 minutes, so 16:30-17:00. However, the work hours end at 17:00, so that's a possible slot. Wait, but the constraints say the meeting must be between 9:00 and 17:00, so 16:30-17:00 on Monday works for both? Let me check again.\n\nWait, Mary's schedule for Monday isn't provided, so I think she's available. Alexis is blocked until 16:30, so from 16:30 to 17:00 is free. That's a 30-minute slot. So Monday at 16:30-17:00 could work. But the solution provided in the example was Wednesday at 14:30-15:00. Hmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the schedules.\n\nMary's schedule doesn't mention Monday, so she's available all day. Alexis on Monday is blocked until 16:30, so from 16:30 to 17:00 is free. That's a 30-minute slot. So why isn't that the solution? Maybe I overlooked that the example solution was for a different task. In the user's problem, maybe the solution is Wednesday because the example given was different. Wait, no, the user provided a solution for their example, but now I'm solving a new problem.\n\nWait, no, the user's problem is the same as the example. So in the example, the solution was Wednesday at 14:30-15:00. Let me check why Monday isn't considered.\n\nWait, in the example, the solution was Wednesday. Maybe because the earliest available time is on Wednesday. Let me check each day in order.\n\nStarting with Monday:\n\nMary is free all day. Alexis is busy until 16:30. So the earliest available slot is 16:30-17:00. That's possible, but maybe the code is checking days in order and finds an earlier slot on Wednesday.\n\nWait, no, Monday is earlier than Wednesday. So why wasn't Monday chosen? Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting Alexis's schedule on Monday.\n\nLooking back: Alexis on Monday is blocked from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-16:30. So the free times are 10:00-10:30, 12:00-12:30, and after 16:30. But the work hours end at 17:00, so the only possible slot is 16:30-17:00.\n\nBut wait, the meeting has to be at least 30 minutes. 16:30-17:00 is exactly 30 minutes. So that's a valid slot. So why is the solution on Wednesday?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the example. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the solution was Wednesday at 14:30-15:00. So perhaps in that case, Monday wasn't an option because of some other constraint, but in this problem, it's allowed.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the group would like to meet at their earliest availability. So the earliest possible time across all days.\n\nSo Monday's 16:30 is earlier than Wednesday's 14:30? No, Monday is earlier in the week, so 16:30 on Monday is earlier than 14:30 on Wednesday.\n\nWait, no, Monday comes before Wednesday, so the earliest available time would be on Monday. But in the example solution, it's Wednesday. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps Alexis isn't available on Monday at 16:30. Let me re-examine Alexis's Monday schedule.\n\nAlexis on Monday is blocked until 16:30, so from 16:30 to 17:00 is free. So that's a valid slot. So why isn't that the solution?\n\nWait, maybe Mary isn't available on Monday. Wait, the problem states that Mary's schedule is provided for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. It doesn't mention Monday, so she's available all day on Monday. So the meeting could be scheduled on Monday at 16:30-17:00.\n\nBut in the example solution, it's Wednesday. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the example given by the user is a different scenario, but the problem I'm solving now is the same as the example. So the solution should be Wednesday at 14:30-15:00.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking the availability on Wednesday.\n\nLet me check Wednesday for both.\n\nMary on Wednesday is busy from 9:30-10:00 and 15:00-15:30. So her available times are from 10:00-9:30? Wait, no, 9:30-10:00 is busy, so before that, from 9:00-9:30 is free. Then from 10:00-15:00, she's free except for 15:00-15:30.\n\nWait, no, Mary's Wednesday schedule is 9:30-10:00 and 15:00-15:30. So she's free from 10:00-15:00, except for 15:00-15:30. So from 10:00-15:00, she's available, except for the 15:00 slot.\n\nAlexis on Wednesday is busy from 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-17:00. So Alexis is free from 11:00-11:30.\n\nSo the overlapping free time on Wednesday is from 11:00-11:30, but Mary is available from 10:00-15:00, except 15:00-15:30. So the overlapping time is 11:00-11:30. But that's only 30 minutes. So a meeting could be scheduled at 11:00-11:30.\n\nBut the example solution is 14:30-15:00. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for the earliest possible time across all days.\n\nMonday: 16:30-17:00.\n\nWednesday: 11:00-11:30.\n\nSo 11:00 on Wednesday is earlier than 16:30 on Monday. So the earliest would be Wednesday at 11:00.\n\nBut the example solution is 14:30-15:00. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-examine Alexis's Wednesday schedule. She's busy from 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-17:00. So she's free from 11:00-11:30.\n\nMary on Wednesday is free from 10:00-15:00, except 15:00-15:30. So overlapping is 11:00-11:30.\n\nSo the earliest possible time is Wednesday at 11:00.\n\nBut the example solution is 14:30-15:00. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the code is considering the earliest time after 9:00, so Monday's 16:30 is later than Wednesday's 11:00. So the earliest would be Wednesday at 11:00.\n\nBut the example solution is 14:30-15:00, so perhaps I'm missing other constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the meeting duration is 30 minutes, but the code is looking for the earliest possible start time, not the earliest day.\n\nWait, no, the earliest availability would be the earliest time across all days. So Monday's 16:30 is on Monday, which is earlier in the week than Wednesday. So the meeting should be on Monday at 16:30.\n\nBut the example solution is Wednesday. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Alexis isn't available on Monday at 16:30. Let me check again.\n\nAlexis on Monday is blocked until 16:30, so from 16:30 onwards, she's free. So 16:30-17:00 is available.\n\nMary is free on Monday all day, so yes.\n\nSo the earliest possible time is Monday at 16:30.\n\nBut the example solution is Wednesday. So perhaps the example was different, but in this problem, the correct answer is Monday at 16:30.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the example with the problem. The example provided by the user had a solution on Wednesday, but the problem I'm solving is the same as the example. So the correct answer should be Wednesday at 14:30.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the schedules.\n\nLet me re-examine the schedules.\n\nMary's schedule:\n\nTuesday: 10:00-10:30, 15:30-16:00, 15:00-15:30 (wait, 15:00-15:30 is on Wednesday, right? So on Tuesday, she's busy at 10:00-10:30, 15:30-16:00.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nMary has meetings on Tuesday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30.\n\nSo on Tuesday, Mary is busy at 10:00-10:30 and 15:30-16:00. So from 9:00-10:00, she's free, then busy until 10:30, then free from 10:30-15:30, then busy until 16:00, then free after.\n\nAlexis's schedule:\n\nMonday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-16:30.\n\nSo on Monday, Alexis is busy from 9:00-10:00, then 10:30-12:00, then 12:30-16:30. So her free times are 10:00-10:30, 12:00-12:30, and after 16:30.\n\nSo on Monday, the possible slots are:\n\n10:00-10:30 (30 minutes)\n\n12:00-12:30 (30 minutes)\n\n16:30-17:00 (30 minutes)\n\nMary is free all day on Monday, so any of these slots work.\n\nSo the earliest possible time is Monday at 10:00-10:30.\n\nWait, that's even earlier than Wednesday. So why wasn't that considered?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says that the meeting needs to be scheduled between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.\n\nMary's schedule on Monday isn't provided, so she's available. Alexis has a free slot on Monday from 10:00-10:30.\n\nSo that's a 30-minute slot. So the earliest possible time is Monday at 10:00.\n\nBut the example solution was Wednesday at 14:30. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the code needs to find the earliest possible time, which would be Monday at 10:00.\n\nBut the example solution was different. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Alexis's schedule on Monday is more restricted. Let me check again.\n\nAlexis on Monday is blocked from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-16:30.\n\nSo she's free from 10:00-10:30, 12:00-12:30, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo 10:00-10:30 is a valid slot.\n\nMary is available on Monday all day.\n\nSo the earliest possible time is Monday at 10:00-10:30.\n\nBut the example solution was Wednesday. So perhaps the example had different schedules, but in this problem, the correct answer is Monday at 10:00.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the example with the problem. The example provided by the user was a different scenario, and the problem I'm solving is the same as the example. So the correct answer should be Wednesday at 14:30.\n\nWait, no, the problem is the same as the example. So the solution should be Wednesday at 14:30.\n\nBut according to the schedules, Monday has an earlier slot. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps Mary isn't available on Monday. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem states that Mary has meetings on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. It doesn't mention Monday, so she's available all day.\n\nSo the earliest possible time is Monday at 10:00.\n\nBut the example solution was Wednesday. So perhaps the example was incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering the earliest time after 9:00, but Monday's 10:00 is earlier than Wednesday's 14:30.\n\nSo the correct answer should be Monday at 10:00-10:30.\n\nBut the example solution was Wednesday. So perhaps the example was a different problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was for a different set of schedules. Let me re-examine the example.\n\nIn the example, Mary's schedule was:\n\nTuesday: 10:00-10:30, 15:30-16:00, Wednesday: 9:30-10:00, 15:00-15:30, Thursday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30.\n\nAlexis's schedule was:\n\nMonday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-16:30.\n\nTuesday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n\nWednesday: 9:00-11:00, 11:30-17:00.\n\nThursday: 10:00-12:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo on Monday, Alexis is free from 10:00-10:30, which is 30 minutes. So the earliest possible time is Monday at 10:00.\n\nBut the example solution was Wednesday at 14:30.\n\nSo perhaps the example was incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering the earliest time after 9:00, but Monday's 10:00 is earlier than Wednesday's 14:30.\n\nSo the correct answer should be Monday at 10:00-10:30.\n\nBut the example solution was different. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is looking for the earliest time on the earliest day, but in the example, it's Wednesday because Monday wasn't an option. But according to the problem, Monday is an option.\n\nI'm confused. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nI'll list all possible free slots for each day where both are available.\n\nMonday:\n\nAlexis is free from 10:00-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 16:30-17:00.\n\nMary is available all day.\n\nSo possible slots:\n\n10:00-10:30\n\n12:00-12:30\n\n16:30-17:00\n\nTuesday:\n\nMary is busy from 10:00-10:30, 15:30-16:00.\n\nAlexis is busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n\nSo overlapping free times:\n\nFrom 9:00-10:00: Mary is free, Alexis busy.\n\n10:30-10:30: Mary busy until 10:30, Alexis busy until 11:30.\n\nWait, Mary is busy until 10:30, so from 10:30 onwards, she's free. Alexis is busy until 11:30.\n\nSo from 10:30-11:30, Mary is free, Alexis busy.\n\nThen from 11:30-12:00: Mary free, Alexis free? Wait, Alexis is busy from 12:00-15:30.\n\nSo from 11:30-12:00, Alexis is free? No, Alexis is busy from 12:00-15:30, so before that, she's free from 11:30-12:00.\n\nSo overlapping free time on Tuesday is 11:30-12:00, but that's only 30 minutes.\n\nWait, 11:30-12:00 is 30 minutes, so that's a possible slot.\n\nBut Mary is free from 10:30-15:30, except 15:30-16:00.\n\nAlexis is free from 11:30-12:00, then busy until 15:30.\n\nSo overlapping free time is 11:30-12:00.\n\nWednesday:\n\nMary is busy from 9:30-10:00 and 15:00-15:30.\n\nAlexis is busy from 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-17:00.\n\nSo overlapping free time is 11:00-11:30.\n\nThursday:\n\nMary is busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30.\n\nAlexis is busy from 10:00-12:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo overlapping free times:\n\nFrom 9:00-10:00: Mary busy, Alexis free from 9:00-10:00? No, Alexis is busy from 10:00-12:00.\n\nWait, Alexis on Thursday is busy from 10:00-12:00, so before that, she's free from 9:00-10:00.\n\nMary is busy from 9:00-10:00, so no overlap.\n\nFrom 10:00-10:30: Mary is free, Alexis busy until 12:00.\n\nFrom 11:30-14:00: Mary is free from 11:30-14:00 (since she's busy until 11:30), Alexis is busy until 12:00, then free from 12:00-14:00.\n\nWait, Alexis is busy from 10:00-12:00, so from 12:00-14:00, she's free.\n\nMary is free from 11:30-14:00.\n\nSo overlapping from 12:00-14:00.\n\nBut the meeting is 30 minutes, so possible slots at 12:00-12:30, 12:30-13:00, etc.\n\nBut the earliest possible time is Monday at 10:00.\n\nSo the earliest possible meeting is Monday at 10:00-10:30.\n\nBut the example solution was Wednesday at 14:30.\n\nSo perhaps the example was incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering the earliest possible time after 9:00, which would be Monday at 10:00.\n\nSo the correct answer should be Monday at 10:00-10:30.\n\nBut the example solution was different. So perhaps the example had different constraints.\n\nIn any case, based on the given schedules, the earliest possible time is Monday at 10:00-10:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    mary_schedule = {\n        'Tuesday': [(10*60, 10.5*60), (15.5*60, 16*60)],\n        'Wednesday': [(9.5*60, 10*60), (15*60, 15.5*60)],\n        'Thursday': [(9*60, 10*60), (10.5*60, 11.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    alexis_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 10*60), (10.5*60, 12*60), (12.5*60, 16.5*60)],\n        'Tuesday': [(9*60, 10*60), (10.5*60, 11.5*60), (12*60, 15.5*60), (16*60, 17*60)],\n        'Wednesday': [(9*60, 11*60), (11.5*60, 17*60)],\n        'Thursday': [(10*60, 12*60), (14*60, 14.5*60), (15.5*60, 16*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday']\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    for day in days:\n        # Get busy intervals for both participants on the current day\n        mary_busy = mary_schedule.get(day, [])\n        alexis_busy = alexis_schedule.get(day, [])\n\n        # Combine and sort all busy intervals\n        all_busy = []\n        for interval in mary_busy:\n            all_busy.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Mary'))\n        for interval in alexis_busy:\n            all_busy.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Alexis'))\n\n        all_busy.sort()\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        current_time = start_time\n        for busy_start, busy_end, person in all_busy:\n            if current_time < busy_start:\n                # Found an available slot\n                if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                    # Format the time\n                    start_h = current_time // 60\n                    start_m = current_time % 60\n                    end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                    end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n                    \n                    # Convert to HH:MM format\n                    start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                    end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n                    \n                    print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                    return\n            current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n        # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            start_h = current_time // 60\n            start_m = current_time % 60\n            end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n            end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n            \n            start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n            end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n            \n            print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n            return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
