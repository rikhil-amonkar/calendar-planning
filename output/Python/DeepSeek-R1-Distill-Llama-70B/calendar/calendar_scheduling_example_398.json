            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I've got this task to schedule a meeting for six people: Doris, Theresa, Christian, Terry, Carolyn, and Kyle. They all need to meet for half an hour on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The catch is that each of them has different parts of their day blocked off, and I need to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand everyone's availability. Let me list out their blocked times:\n\n- **Doris**: 9:00-11:00, 13:30-14:00, 16:00-16:30\n- **Theresa**: 10:00-12:00\n- **Christian**: No meetings all day, so he's free anytime\n- **Terry**: 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00\n- **Carolyn**: 9:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-14:30, 15:00-17:00\n- **Kyle**: 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-17:00\n\nOkay, so Christian is available all day, which is helpful, but I need to focus on the others.\n\nI think the best approach is to convert all these blocked times into minutes since midnight to make it easier to compare and find overlaps. For example, 9:00 is 540 minutes, 10:00 is 600 minutes, and so on.\n\nNext, I'll create a list of all the busy intervals for each person and then determine their available slots within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00.\n\nOnce I have everyone's available slots, I'll look for overlapping times where all six can meet. Since the meeting is only half an hour long, I need a 30-minute window where none of them have any conflicts.\n\nI should start by identifying the earliest possible time and check each 30-minute window to see if it fits everyone's schedule. It might take some iteration, but since the problem states that a solution exists, I won't have to worry about not finding a time.\n\nI also need to make sure that after finding a suitable time, I convert it back to the HH:MM format and include the day of the week, which is Monday in this case.\n\nAlright, let's get started with writing the Python code to handle all of this.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    start_time = \"09:00\"\n    end_time = \"17:00\"\n    \n    # Define participants' busy intervals as dictionaries with name and time ranges\n    participants = {\n        \"Doris\": [\n            (\"09:00\", \"11:00\"),\n            (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"),\n            (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")\n        ],\n        \"Theresa\": [\n            (\"10:00\", \"12:00\")\n        ],\n        \"Christian\": [],\n        \"Terry\": [\n            (\"09:30\", \"10:00\"),\n            (\"11:30\", \"12:00\"),\n            (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"),\n            (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"),\n            (\"14:30\", \"15:00\"),\n            (\"15:30\", \"17:00\")\n        ],\n        \"Carolyn\": [\n            (\"09:00\", \"10:30\"),\n            (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"),\n            (\"12:00\", \"13:00\"),\n            (\"13:30\", \"14:30\"),\n            (\"15:00\", \"17:00\")\n        ],\n        \"Kyle\": [\n            (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n            (\"11:30\", \"12:00\"),\n            (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"),\n            (\"14:30\", \"17:00\")\n        ]\n    }\n    \n    # Convert time strings to minutes since midnight for easier comparison\n    def time_to_minutes(time_str):\n        hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n        return hours * 60 + mins\n    \n    # Convert all busy intervals to minutes\n    busy_intervals = {}\n    for name, intervals in participants.items():\n        busy = []\n        for start, end in intervals:\n            busy_start = time_to_minutes(start)\n            busy_end = time_to_minutes(end)\n            busy.append((busy_start, busy_end))\n        busy_intervals[name] = busy\n    \n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Generate all possible time slots within work hours\n    work_start = time_to_minutes(start_time)\n    work_end = time_to_minutes(end_time)\n    \n    # Find all available time slots for each participant\n    available_slots = {}\n    for name, intervals in busy_intervals.items():\n        available = []\n        previous_end = work_start\n        \n        # Add available slots before the first busy interval\n        if intervals and intervals[0][0] > previous_end:\n            available.append((previous_end, intervals[0][0]))\n        \n        # Add available slots between busy intervals\n        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):\n            current_start = intervals[i-1][1]\n            next_start = intervals[i][0]\n            if current_start < next_start:\n                available.append((current_start, next_start))\n        \n        # Add available slots after the last busy interval\n        if intervals:\n            last_end = intervals[-1][1]\n            if last_end < work_end:\n                available.append((last_end, work_end))\n        else:\n            # If no busy intervals, the entire work time is available\n            available.append((work_start, work_end))\n        \n        available_slots[name] = available\n    \n    # Find overlapping available slots that can accommodate the meeting duration\n    all_available = []\n    for name in participants:\n        all_available.append(available_slots[name])\n    \n    # Find common available time slots across all participants\n    common_slots = all_available[0]\n    for slots in all_available[1:]:\n        new_common = []\n        for slot1 in common_slots:\n            for slot2 in slots:\n                # Find the overlapping start and end\n                start = max(slot1[0], slot2[0])\n                end = min(slot1[1], slot2[1])\n                if end - start >= meeting_duration:\n                    new_common.append((start, end))\n        common_slots = new_common\n        if not common_slots:\n            break\n    \n    # Convert the first available overlapping slot back to HH:MM format\n    if common_slots:\n        meeting_start, meeting_end = common_slots[0]\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            hours = minutes // 60\n            mins = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{hours:02d}:{mins:02d}\"\n        \n        meeting_start_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_start)\n        meeting_end_str = minutes_to_time(meeting_end)\n        day = \"Monday\"\n        return f\"{meeting_start_str}:{meeting_end_str}:{day}\"\n    else:\n        return \"No available time slot found that accommodates everyone.\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
