            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to find a suitable time for a meeting involving Tyler, Kelly, Stephanie, Hannah, Joe, Diana, and Deborah. The meeting should be half an hour long, between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. \n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's availability:\n\n- Tyler and Kelly are free all day.\n- Stephanie is busy from 11:00-11:30 and 14:30-15:00.\n- Hannah is free all day.\n- Joe is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, and 14:00-17:00.\n- Diana is busy from 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:30, and 16:00-17:00.\n- Deborah is busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nI need to find a time that's free for everyone. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **9:00-10:00**: Deborah is busy, so we can't meet then.\n2. **10:00-10:30**: Only Diana is busy here, so others are free. But since Diana is busy, this slot isn't available.\n3. **10:30-11:00**: Everyone except Stephanie is free. But Stephanie is free, so this slot is available.\n4. **11:00-11:30**: Stephanie is busy, so we can't meet then.\n5. **11:30-12:00**: Diana is busy, so this slot is out.\n6. **12:00-12:30**: Deborah and Joe are busy, so no go.\n7. **12:30-13:00**: Deborah and Joe are busy.\n8. **13:00-14:00**: Diana is busy.\n9. **14:00-14:30**: Joe is busy after 14:00, so this slot is partially busy.\n10. **14:30-15:00**: Stephanie and Deborah are busy.\n11. **15:00-16:00**: Deborah is busy from 16:00, so up to 16:00, but Diana is busy from 16:00.\n12. **16:00-17:00**: Deborah and Diana are busy.\n\nLooking at the available slots, 10:30-11:00 seems to be the only time when everyone is free. It's a 30-minute window, which fits the meeting duration. I should double-check to make sure no one else is busy then. Tyler, Kelly, Hannah are free, Stephanie is free, Joe is free until 10:00 but free again after 12:00, but wait, Joe is busy from 10:00-12:00. Oh, that's a problem. So 10:30-11:00 is within Joe's busy time. That means Joe can't attend.\n\nHmm, I need to find another slot. Let me check again.\n\n- **13:00-14:00**: Diana is busy, so no.\n- **15:00-15:30**: Deborah is busy until 15:30, so 15:00-15:30 is partially busy.\n- **15:30-16:00**: Deborah is free, Diana is busy from 16:00, but maybe 15:30-16:00 works? Wait, Deborah is busy until 15:30, so 15:30-16:00 might be possible, but Diana is busy at 16:00. So 15:30-16:00 would overlap with Diana's busy time.\n\nWait, I think I missed something. Let me re-examine Joe's schedule. Joe is busy from 10:00-12:00 and 14:00-17:00. So between 12:00-14:00, he's free except for 12:30-13:00. So maybe 13:00-14:00? But Diana is busy then. \n\nWhat about 12:00-12:30? Deborah is busy, so no. 13:30-14:00? Deborah is busy. \n\nWait, what about 15:00-15:30? Deborah is busy until 15:30, so that's no good. 15:30-16:00? Deborah is free after 15:30, but Diana is busy from 16:00. So 15:30-16:00 might work, but Diana is busy at 16:00, so the meeting would have to end by 16:00. \n\nWait, the meeting is half an hour, so 15:30-16:00 would work if Diana can attend. But Diana is busy from 16:00, so she can't make it. \n\nI'm getting stuck. Let me look for any 30-minute window where all are free. It seems like the only possible time is 10:30-11:00, but Joe is busy then. So maybe there's no solution, but the problem states there is one. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, Joe is busy until 12:00, so 9:00-10:00 is busy for Deborah, 10:00-10:30 is busy for Diana, 10:30-11:00 is busy for Joe. 11:00-11:30 is busy for Stephanie. 11:30-12:00 is busy for Diana. 12:00-12:30 is busy for Deborah and Joe. 12:30-13:00 is busy for Deborah and Joe. 13:00-14:00 is busy for Diana. 14:00-14:30 is busy for Joe. 14:30-15:00 is busy for Stephanie and Deborah. 15:00-15:30 is busy for Deborah. 15:30-16:00 is busy for Deborah until 15:30 and Diana at 16:00. 16:00-17:00 is busy for Deborah and Diana.\n\nWait, maybe 13:30-14:00? Deborah is busy, so no. 14:00-14:30 is busy for Joe. 14:30-15:00 is busy for Stephanie and Deborah. 15:00-15:30 is busy for Deborah. 15:30-16:00 is partially busy for Deborah and Diana. \n\nI'm not finding a slot. But the problem says there's a solution. Maybe I overlooked something. Let me check again.\n\nAh, maybe 12:00-13:00? Deborah is busy until 12:00, but her next busy time starts at 12:30. So 12:00-12:30 is free for Deborah. Joe is busy until 12:00, so 12:00-13:00 is free for Joe. Diana is busy from 13:00, so 12:00-13:00 is free for her. Stephanie is free. So 12:00-13:00 seems to work for everyone except Deborah, who is busy until 12:00. Wait, Deborah is busy until 12:00, so 12:00-13:00 might be possible if she's free at 12:00. Let me confirm Deborah's schedule: she's busy until 12:00, so 12:00-13:00 is free for her. Joe is busy until 12:00, so 12:00-13:00 is free for him. Diana is busy from 13:00, so 12:00-13:00 is free. Stephanie is free. So 12:00-13:00 works for everyone. That's a 60-minute slot, so a 30-minute meeting can be scheduled there.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    start_time = \"09:00\"\n    end_time = \"17:00\"\n    \n    # Define participants' busy intervals as dictionaries with name and time ranges\n    participants = {\n        \"Tyler\": [],\n        \"Kelly\": [],\n        \"Stephanie\": [\n            (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"),\n            (\"14:30\", \"15:00\")\n        ],\n        \"Hannah\": [],\n        \"Joe\": [\n            (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n            (\"10:00\", \"12:00\"),\n            (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"),\n            (\"14:00\", \"17:00\")\n        ],\n        \"Diana\": [\n            (\"09:00\", \"10:30\"),\n            (\"11:30\", \"12:00\"),\n            (\"13:00\", \"14:00\"),\n            (\"14:30\", \"15:30\"),\n            (\"16:00\", \"17:00\")\n        ],\n        \"Deborah\": [\n            (\"09:00\", \"10:00\"),\n            (\"10:30\", \"12:00\"),\n            (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"),\n            (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"),\n            (\"14:30\", \"15:30\"),\n            (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")\n        ]\n    }\n    \n    # Convert time strings to minutes since midnight for easier comparison\n    def time_to_minutes(time_str):\n        hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n        return hours * 60 + mins\n    \n    # Convert all busy intervals to minutes\n    busy_intervals = {}\n    for name, intervals in participants.items():\n        busy = []\n        for start, end in intervals:\n            busy_start = time_to_minutes(start)\n            busy_end = time_to_minutes(end)\n            busy.append((busy_start, busy_end))\n        busy_intervals[name] = busy\n    \n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Generate all possible time slots within work hours\n    work_start = time_to_minutes(start_time)\n    work_end = time_to_minutes(end_time)\n    \n    # Find all available time slots for each participant\n    available_slots = {}\n    for name, intervals in busy_intervals.items():\n        available = []\n        previous_end = work_start\n        \n        # Add available slots before the first busy interval\n        if intervals and intervals[0][0] > previous_end:\n            available.append((previous_end, intervals[0][0]))\n        \n        # Add available slots between busy intervals\n        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):\n            current_start = intervals[i-1][1]\n            next_start = intervals[i][0]\n            if current_start < next_start:\n                available.append((current_start, next_start))\n        \n        # Add available slots after the last busy interval\n        if intervals:\n            last_end = intervals[-1][1]\n            if last_end < work_end:\n                available.append((last_end, work_end))\n        else:\n            # If no busy intervals, the entire work time is available\n            available.append((work_start, work_end))\n        \n        available_slots[name] = available\n    \n    # Find overlapping available slots that can accommodate the meeting duration\n    tyler_available = available_slots[\"Tyler\"]\n    kelly_available = available_slots[\"Kelly\"]\n    stephanie_available = available_slots[\"Stephanie\"]\n    hannah_available = available_slots[\"Hannah\"]\n    joe_available = available_slots[\"Joe\"]\n    diana_available = available_slots[\"Diana\"]\n    deborah_available = available_slots[\"Deborah\"]\n    \n    overlapping_slots = []\n    for t_slot in tyler_available:\n        for k_slot in kelly_available:\n            for s_slot in stephanie_available:\n                for h_slot in hannah_available:\n                    for j_slot in joe_available:\n                        for d_slot in diana_available:\n                            for de_slot in deborah_available:\n                                # Find the overlapping start and end\n                                start = max(t_slot[0], k_slot[0], s_slot[0], h_slot[0], j_slot[0], d_slot[0], de_slot[0])\n                                end = min(t_slot[1], k_slot[1], s_slot[1], h_slot[1], j_slot[1], d_slot[1], de_slot[1])\n                                \n                                if end -
