            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to find a suitable time for a meeting between Martha and Beverly. The meeting should be one hour long and can be scheduled on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00 each day.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Martha's schedule. On Monday, she's free except from 16:00 to 17:00. So, any time before 16:00 on Monday could work, but I need to check Beverly's availability too.\n\nBeverly's schedule is a bit more complicated. On Monday, she's busy from 9:00 to 13:30 and then from 14:00 to 17:00. That means on Monday, the only possible time for both would be between 13:30 and 14:00, but that's only a 30-minute window, and we need an hour. So Monday might not work.\n\nNext, Tuesday. Martha is free except from 15:00 to 15:30. Beverly, however, is fully booked from 9:00 to 17:00 on Tuesday. So Tuesday is out of the question since Beverly isn't available at all.\n\nNow, Wednesday. Martha has blocked times from 10:00 to 11:00 and 14:00 to 14:30. Beverly is busy from 9:30 to 15:30 and then from 16:30 to 17:00. So, on Wednesday, the possible windows are:\n\n- Between 9:00 and 9:30 (but Beverly is free only after 9:30, so that's not possible)\n- Between 11:00 and 14:00 (since Martha is free here except her blocked times)\n- Between 15:30 and 16:30 (since Beverly is free here, and Martha's only blocked time ends at 14:30)\n\nLooking at the 11:00 to 14:00 window, Martha is free, and Beverly is busy until 15:30, so that doesn't overlap. The next possible window is from 15:30 to 16:30. Martha is free after 14:30, and Beverly is free from 15:30 to 16:30.\n\nSo, scheduling the meeting from 15:30 to 16:30 on Wednesday seems to work for both Martha and Beverly. I'll write a Python script to confirm this by checking all possible time slots across the three days and ensuring that this time is indeed available for both.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Define the schedules for each participant as dictionaries with blocked time slots\nschedules = {\n    \"Martha\": {\n        \"Monday\": [(16, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(15, 0, 15, 30)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(10, 0, 11, 0), (14, 0, 14, 30)]\n    },\n    \"Beverly\": {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 0, 13, 30), (14, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9, 30, 15, 30), (16, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n}\n\n# Function to check if a time slot is available for all participants on a given day\ndef is_available(day, start_hour, start_minute, end_hour, end_minute, schedules):\n    for name, days in schedules.items():\n        for block in days.get(day, []):\n            # Convert time to minutes for easier comparison\n            block_start = block[0] * 60 + block[1]\n            block_end = block[2] * 60 + block[3]\n            \n            meeting_start = start_hour * 60 + start_minute\n            meeting_end = end_hour * 60 + end_minute\n            \n            # Check if meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n            if not (meeting_end <= block_start or meeting_start >= block_end):\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Iterate through possible days\ndays = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\nfor day in days:\n    # Iterate through possible start times (on the hour and half past)\n    for hour in range(9, 17):\n        for minute in [0, 30]:\n            start_hour, start_minute = hour, minute\n            end_hour, end_minute = hour, minute + 30\n            \n            # Ensure end time doesn't exceed 17:00\n            if end_hour > 17 or (end_hour == 17 and end_minute != 0):\n                continue\n                \n            # Check availability for all participants\n            if is_available(day, start_hour, start_minute, end_hour, end_minute, schedules):\n                print(f\"Proposed time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on {day}\")\n                exit()\n\n# If no time found (shouldn't happen as per problem statement)\nprint(\"No available time found.\")\n```",
