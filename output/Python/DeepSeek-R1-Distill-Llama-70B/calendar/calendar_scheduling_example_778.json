The meeting should be half an hour long and can be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday between 9 AM and 5 PM. \n\nFirst, let's look at Susan's schedule. She's busy on Monday from 12:30 to 13:00 and 13:30 to 14:00. On Tuesday, she's busy from 11:30 to 12:00. On Wednesday, she's busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:30 to 16:30. Also, Susan prefers not to meet on Tuesday.\n\nNow, Sandra's schedule is a bit more complicated. On Monday, she's busy from 9 AM to 1 PM, 2 PM to 3 PM, and 4 PM to 4:30 PM. She can't meet on Monday after 4 PM. On Tuesday, she's busy from 9 AM to 9:30 AM, 10:30 AM to 12 PM, 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM, 2 PM to 2:30 PM, and 4 PM to 5 PM. On Wednesday, she's busy from 9 AM to 11:30 AM, 12 PM to 12:30 PM, and 1 PM to 5 PM.\n\nSince Susan doesn't want to meet on Tuesday, I'll focus on Monday and Wednesday.\n\nStarting with Monday, I'll look for a 30-minute slot where both are free. Susan is free before 12:30 PM, but Sandra is busy until 1 PM. After checking, it seems there's no overlap on Monday where both are free for 30 minutes.\n\nNext, I'll check Wednesday. Susan is free from 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM, excluding her busy times. Sandra is free from 11:30 AM to 12 PM and then from 12:30 PM to 1 PM. The overlap between them on Wednesday is from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM. That's a 30-minute window, which fits our meeting duration.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled on Wednesday from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9,\n        \"end\": 17\n    }\n\n    # Define participants' schedules\n    susan_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [[12.5, 13], [13.5, 14]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[11.5, 12]],\n        \"Wednesday\": [[9.5, 10.5], [14, 14.5], [15.5, 16.5]]\n    }\n\n    sandra_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [[9, 13], [14, 15], [16, 16.5]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[9, 9.5], [10.5, 12], [12.5, 13.5], [14, 14.5], [16, 17]],\n        \"Wednesday\": [[9, 11.5], [12, 12.5], [13, 17]]\n    }\n\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    meeting_duration = 0.5  # In hours (30 minutes)\n\n    # Define the days to check (Susan rather not meet on Tuesday)\n    days_to_check = [\"Monday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n\n    # Sandra's constraint: can not meet on Monday after 16:00\n    sandra_constraint = {\n        \"Monday\": 16\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through each day\n    for day in days_to_check:\n        # Apply Sandra's constraint for Monday\n        if day == \"Monday\":\n            sandra_busy = [interval for interval in sandra_schedule[day] if interval[1] <= sandra_constraint[day]]\n        else:\n            sandra_busy = sandra_schedule[day]\n\n        # Combine and sort all busy intervals for both participants\n        susan_busy = susan_schedule[day]\n        all_busy = sorted(susan_busy + sandra_busy, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n        # Initialize previous end time to work hours start\n        prev_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n\n        # Iterate through each busy interval\n        for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n            # Check for available slot before the busy interval starts\n            if busy_start - prev_end >= meeting_duration:\n                # Format the time slots\n                start_time = prev_end\n                end_time = prev_end + meeting_duration\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_hh = int(start_time)\n                start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n                end_hh = int(end_time)\n                end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n                # Return the earliest available time\n                return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on {day}\"\n            \n            # Update previous end time\n            prev_end = max(prev_end, busy_end)\n\n        # Check for available slot after the last busy interval\n        if work_hours[\"end\"] - prev_end >= meeting_duration:\n            start_time = prev_end\n            end_time = prev_end + meeting_duration\n            start_hh = int(start_time)\n            start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n            end_hh = int(end_time)\n            end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n            return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
