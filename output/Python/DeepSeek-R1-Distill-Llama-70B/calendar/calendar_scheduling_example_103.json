            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to schedule a meeting for Diane, Jack, Eugene, and Patricia. The meeting should be half an hour long, between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Each person has some blocked times, so I need to find a time that none of them are busy.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's blocked times to see where the overlaps are. \n\nDiane is busy from 9:30-10:00 and 14:30-15:00. So her available times are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-14:30, and 15:00-17:00.\n\nJack is busy from 13:30-14:00 and 14:30-15:00. So he's free from 9:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, and 15:00-17:00.\n\nEugene has a lot of blocks: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-14:30, and 15:00-16:30. So his available slots are 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 14:30-15:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nPatricia is busy from 9:30-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 12:30-14:00, and 15:00-16:30. So her free times are 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 14:00-15:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute window where all four are free. Let me check each person's available times and see where they all overlap.\n\nLooking at Diane's availability, let's check each of her free periods against the others.\n\n1. 9:00-9:30: \n   - Jack is free here.\n   - Eugene is busy until 10:00, so he's not free.\n   - Patricia is free from 9:00-9:30, but since Eugene isn't, this slot doesn't work.\n\n2. 10:00-14:30:\n   - Let's break this down. Maybe around 11:00? But Patricia is busy from 11:00-12:00. How about 10:30-11:00? Patricia is free then, but Eugene is busy until 10:30. So 10:30-11:00 might not work because Eugene is busy until 10:30. Wait, Eugene is free from 10:00-10:30, so 10:30-11:00 is when Patricia is free but Eugene is busy starting at 10:30. Hmm, maybe 10:00-10:30? Let's check:\n     - Diane: free\n     - Jack: free\n     - Eugene: free until 10:30? Wait, Eugene is busy from 9:00-10:00, then free until 10:30? Wait, no. Eugene's schedule is 9:00-10:00 blocked, then 10:30-11:30 blocked. So he's free from 10:00-10:30. So 10:00-10:30 is a possible slot. Let's see others:\n     - Patricia: She's busy from 9:30-10:30, so at 10:00-10:30, she's still busy until 10:30. So Patricia isn't free then.\n\n   Next, maybe after 12:00. Let's see. After 12:00, Diane is free until 14:30. Jack is free until 13:30. Eugene is busy from 12:00-14:30, so he's not free. So that's a problem.\n\n   How about between 14:00-14:30? Diane is free until 14:30. Jack is free until 14:00, but then busy from 14:30. Wait, Jack is free from 14:00-14:30? Wait, Jack's blocked times are 13:30-14:00 and 14:30-15:00. So between 14:00-14:30, Jack is free. Let's check others:\n   - Diane: free until 14:30.\n   - Eugene: busy until 14:30, so he's free starting at 14:30.\n   - Patricia: She's busy from 12:30-14:00, so free from 14:00-15:00.\n   So at 14:00-14:30, let's see:\n   - Diane: free\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: busy until 14:30, so he's not free until 14:30.\n   So 14:00-14:30 won't work because Eugene is busy until 14:30.\n\n   Next, maybe 14:30-15:00? But Diane is busy then, so that's out.\n\n   How about 15:00-15:30? Let's check:\n   - Diane: free from 15:00 onwards.\n   - Jack: free from 15:00 onwards.\n   - Eugene: busy until 16:30, so he's busy.\n   So that doesn't work.\n\n   What about 16:30-17:00? Let's see:\n   - Diane: free\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: free from 16:30\n   - Patricia: free from 16:30\n   So 16:30-17:00 could work. But wait, the meeting needs to be half an hour, so 16:30-17:00 is possible, but let me check if there's an earlier slot.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Patricia's availability: she's free from 14:00-15:00. So between 14:00-15:00, Patricia is free. Let's see others:\n\n- Diane: free until 14:30, then busy until 15:00.\n- Jack: free until 14:00, then busy from 14:30.\nWait, no. Jack is busy from 13:30-14:00, so he's free from 14:00-14:30, then busy from 14:30-15:00.\n\nSo in 14:00-14:30, Jack is free, Diane is free, Patricia is free, but Eugene is busy until 14:30.\n\nSo that slot is 14:00-14:30, but Eugene is busy until 14:30. So he can't make it.\n\nWait, but the meeting is half an hour, so it needs a full 30 minutes. So maybe 14:30-15:00? But Diane is busy then, so no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 15:00-15:30? Let's check:\n\n- Diane: free from 15:00\n- Jack: free from 15:00\n- Eugene: busy until 16:30\n- Patricia: busy from 15:00-16:30\n\nSo Patricia is busy then, so that's out.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for a slot where all four are free. Let's check each possible 30-minute window.\n\nLooking at the earliest possible times:\n\nFrom 9:00-9:30: Only Diane, Jack, and Patricia are free, but Eugene is busy.\n\nFrom 10:00-10:30: Diane, Jack, Eugene (until 10:30), but Patricia is busy until 10:30.\n\nFrom 10:30-11:00: Patricia is free, but Eugene is busy starting at 10:30.\n\nFrom 11:30-12:00: Eugene is free, but Patricia is busy from 11:00-12:00.\n\nFrom 12:00-12:30: Patricia is free, but Eugene is busy until 14:30.\n\nWait, no, Eugene is busy from 12:00-14:30, so he's not free until 14:30.\n\nFrom 14:30-15:00: Diane is busy, so no.\n\nFrom 15:00-15:30: Patricia is busy, Eugene is busy.\n\nFrom 16:30-17:00: Everyone except Eugene is free, but Eugene is busy until 16:30, so he's free at 16:30.\n\nWait, so 16:30-17:00:\n\n- Diane: free\n- Jack: free\n- Eugene: free (since his last block ends at 16:30)\n- Patricia: free\n\nSo that works. But is there an earlier time?\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I missed a slot.\n\nWhat about 14:00-14:30?\n\n- Diane: free until 14:30\n- Jack: free from 14:00-14:30\n- Patricia: free from 14:00-15:00\n- Eugene: busy until 14:30\n\nSo Eugene is busy until 14:30, so he can't make it.\n\nWhat about 13:30-14:00? Jack is busy then.\n\nWait, maybe 12:30-13:00? Let's see:\n\n- Diane: free\n- Jack: free (since he's busy from 13:30)\n- Eugene: busy until 14:30\n- Patricia: busy until 14:00\n\nSo no.\n\nHmm, maybe 11:00-11:30? Patricia is busy then.\n\nAlternatively, 10:30-11:00: Patricia is free, but Eugene is busy from 10:30.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a time after 14:30. Let's see:\n\nAfter 14:30, Diane is busy until 15:00. So 15:00 onwards.\n\nAt 15:00-15:30:\n\n- Diane: free\n- Jack: free\n- Eugene: busy until 16:30\n- Patricia: busy until 16:30\n\nSo no.\n\nAt 16:30-17:00:\n\n- Everyone is free except Eugene is busy until 16:30, so he's available at 16:30.\n\nSo that's a possible slot.\n\nWait, but is there a slot between 14:30 and 15:00? Diane is busy, so no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 14:00-14:30 is possible, but Eugene is busy until 14:30, so he can't make it.\n\nWait, maybe the meeting can start at 14:30? But Diane is busy from 14:30-15:00, so she can't.\n\nSo the only available slot seems to be 16:30-17:00.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking at all four schedules again:\n\n- Diane: available at 9:00-9:30, 10:00-14:30, 15:00-17:00\n- Jack: available at 9:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-17:00\n- Eugene: available at 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00\n- Patricia: available at 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 14:00-15:00, 16:30-17:00\n\nLooking for overlapping times:\n\n- 9:00-9:30: Only Diane, Jack, Patricia. Eugene is busy.\n- 10:00-10:30: Diane, Jack, Eugene. Patricia is busy until 10:30.\n- 10:30-11:00: Diane, Jack, Patricia. Eugene is busy.\n- 11:30-12:00: Eugene. Others are busy.\n- 12:00-12:30: Patricia. Others are busy.\n- 14:00-14:30: Diane, Jack, Patricia. Eugene is busy until 14:30.\n- 14:30-15:00: Eugene. Diane is busy.\n- 15:00-15:30: Diane, Jack. Patricia and Eugene busy.\n- 16:30-17:00: All four are free.\n\nSo yes, 16:30-17:00 is the only slot where all four are available.\n\nWait, but the user's solution in the example was 14:30-15:00, but in that case, Diane is busy. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, the example task was different. In the example, the solution was 14:30-15:00, but in that case, perhaps the participants didn't have conflicts. So in this current problem, the correct time is 16:30-17:00.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the blocked times.\n\nWait, Eugene is blocked until 16:30, so he's free at 16:30. Patricia is blocked until 16:30, so she's free at 16:30. Diane and Jack are free then too.\n\nSo the meeting can be scheduled from 16:30 to 17:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Define the schedules for each participant as dictionaries with blocked time slots\nschedules = {\n    \"Diane\": [(9, 30, 10, 0), (14, 30, 15, 0)],\n    \"Jack\": [(13, 30, 14, 0), (14, 30, 15, 0)],\n    \"Eugene\": [(9, 0, 10, 0), (10, 30, 11, 30), (12, 0, 14, 30), (15, 0, 16, 30)],\n    \"Patricia\": [(9, 30, 10, 30), (11, 0, 12, 0), (12, 30, 14, 0), (15, 0, 16, 30)]\n}\n\n# Function to check if a time slot is available for all participants\ndef is_available(start_hour, start_minute, end_hour, end_minute, schedules):\n    for name, blocks in schedules.items():\n        for block in blocks:\n            # Convert time to minutes for easier comparison\n            block_start = block[0] * 60 + block[1]\n            block_end = block[2] * 60 + block[3]\n            \n            meeting_start = start_hour * 60 + start_minute\n            meeting_end = end_hour * 60 + end_minute\n            \n            # Check if meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n            if not (meeting_end <= block_start or meeting_start >= block_end):\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Iterate through possible meeting times (30-minute slots)\nfor hour in range(9, 17):\n    for minute in [0, 30]:\n        start_hour, start_minute = hour, minute\n        end_hour, end_minute = hour, minute + 30\n        \n        # Ensure end time doesn't exceed 17:00\n        if end_hour > 17 or (end_hour == 17 and end_minute != 0):\n            continue\n            \n        # Check availability for all participants\n        if is_available(start_hour, start_minute, end_hour, end_minute, schedules):\n            print(f\"Proposed time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on Monday\")\n            exit()\n\n# If no time found (shouldn't happen as per problem statement)\nprint(\"No available time found.\")\n```",
