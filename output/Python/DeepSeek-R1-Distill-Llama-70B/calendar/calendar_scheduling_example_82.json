Let's look at their schedules.\n\nMichael is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30. So, he's free before 9:30, between 10:30 and 15:00, and between 15:30 and 16:00, and after 16:30.\n\nEric's calendar is completely open, so he's available all day.\n\nArthur is busy from 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, he's free between 12:00 and 13:00, and between 16:00 and 16:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that works for all three. Let's look for overlapping free times.\n\n- Before 9:30: Michael is free, but Arthur is busy until 12:00, so that's not possible.\n- Between 10:30 and 15:00: Michael is free, but Arthur is busy from 13:00 to 15:00, so the only overlapping time here is between 10:30 and 13:00. But we need to check if there's a 30-minute slot in that window that works for everyone.\n- Between 15:30 and 16:00: Michael is free, and Arthur is also free between 16:00 and 16:30. But wait, Arthur is busy until 16:00, so the overlap here is actually from 16:00 to 16:00, which isn't enough. So, that doesn't work.\n- After 16:30: Michael is free after 16:30, but Arthur is busy until 17:00, so that's not possible.\n\nSo, the only possible window is between 10:30 and 13:00. Let's check for a 30-minute slot in that time.\n\nLooking at Michael's schedule, he's free from 10:30 to 15:00, but Arthur is busy from 13:00 to 15:00. So, the latest we can start the meeting is at 12:30 to ensure it ends by 13:00 when Arthur becomes busy.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 12:30 to 13:00.\n\nNow, let's make sure this time works for everyone:\n\n- Michael: Free from 10:30 to 15:00. 12:30-13:00 is within this range.\n- Eric: Available all day.\n- Arthur: Free from 12:00 to 13:00. 12:30-13:00 fits perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the meeting is scheduled for 12:30 to 13:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    michael_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9.5*60, 10.5*60), (15*60, 15.5*60), (16*60, 16.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    eric_schedule = {\n        'Monday': []\n    }\n\n    arthur_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 12*60), (13*60, 15*60), (15.5*60, 16*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    day = 'Monday'\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    busy_intervals = []\n    for interval in michael_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Michael'))\n    for interval in eric_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Eric'))\n    for interval in arthur_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Arthur'))\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    busy_intervals.sort()\n\n    # Find available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end, person in busy_intervals:\n        if current_time < busy_start:\n            if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                # Found a suitable time\n                start_h = current_time // 60\n                start_m = current_time % 60\n                end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n                print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                return\n        current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n    # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        start_h = current_time // 60\n        start_m = current_time % 60\n        end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n        end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n        print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n        return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
