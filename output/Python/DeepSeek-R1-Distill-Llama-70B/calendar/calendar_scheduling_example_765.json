The meeting should be half an hour long, between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. \n\nFirst, I'll outline the constraints. Joshua is busy on Monday from 15:00 to 15:30, Tuesday has a couple of slots, and Joyce has a lot of busy times, especially on Monday and Tuesday. Joyce also prefers not to meet on Monday before 12:00. \n\nI'll start by defining the work hours and the busy intervals for both Joshua and Joyce. Then, I'll create a list of days to check, which are Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n\nNext, for each day, I'll determine the free slots for both Joshua and Joyce. To do this, I'll go through each person's busy times and find the gaps where they are available. \n\nAfter finding the free slots, I'll look for overlapping times where both are free. Since the meeting is 30 minutes long, I need to ensure that the slot is at least that duration.\n\nI should also consider Joyce's preference to not meet on Monday before 12:00. So, on Monday, I'll only look for slots from 12:00 onwards.\n\nOnce I have the overlapping free slots, I'll check each one to see if it can accommodate a 30-minute meeting. The first suitable slot I find will be the proposed time.\n\nI'll structure the code to loop through each day, calculate the free intervals, find the common free times, and then check for a suitable 30-minute slot. If found, it returns the day and the time range. If no slot is found after checking all days, it returns a message indicating that.\n\nI need to make sure the code is clean and well-formatted, as the user requested. Also, the output should be in the specified format, including the day and the time range.\n\nI'll test the code logic in my mind. On Wednesday, Joyce is free from 15:30 to 16:00, which is a 30-minute slot. Joshua's schedule on Wednesday isn't provided, so I assume he's free all day except his specified busy times, which don't conflict here. So, Wednesday at 15:30 to 16:00 seems like a good fit.\n\nI think the code will correctly identify this slot and return it as the solution.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"Monday\": (9, 17),\n        \"Tuesday\": (9, 17),\n        \"Wednesday\": (9, 17)\n    }\n\n    # Define busy intervals for Joshua and Joyce in minutes since midnight\n    # Joshua's busy times\n    joshua_busy = {\n        \"Monday\": [(15*60, 15*60+30)],  # 15:00-15:30\n        \"Tuesday\": [(11*60+30, 12*60),   # 11:30-12:00\n                    (13*60, 13*60+30),   # 13:00-13:30\n                    (14*60+30, 15*60)],  # 14:30-15:00\n        \"Wednesday\": []\n    }\n\n    # Joyce's busy times\n    joyce_busy = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9*60, 9*60+30),      # 9:00-9:30\n                   (10*60, 11*60),       # 10:00-11:00\n                   (11*60+30, 12*60+30), # 11:30-12:30\n                   (13*60, 15*60),       # 13:00-15:00\n                   (15*60+30, 17*60)],   # 15:30-17:00\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9*60, 17*60)],      # 9:00-17:00\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9*60, 9*60+30),   # 9:00-9:30\n                      (10*60, 11*60),    # 10:00-11:00\n                      (12*60+30, 15*60+30), # 12:30-15:30\n                      (16*60, 16*60+30)] # 16:00-16:30\n    }\n\n    # Joyce prefers not to meet on Monday before 12:00\n    def joyce_available(day, start_time, end_time):\n        if day == \"Monday\" and start_time < 12*60:\n            return False\n        return True\n\n    # Function to get free intervals for a person\n    def get_free_intervals(busy, day, work_start, work_end):\n        free = []\n        current = work_start\n        for busy_start, busy_end in busy[day]:\n            if busy_start > current:\n                free.append((current, busy_start))\n            current = max(current, busy_end)\n        if current < work_end:\n            free.append((current, work_end))\n        return free\n\n    # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n    def format_time(minutes):\n        return f\"{minutes//60:02d}:{minutes%60:02d}\"\n\n    # Check each day\n    for day in [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]:\n        work_start, work_end = work_hours[day]\n        work_start *= 60\n        work_end *= 60\n\n        # Get free intervals for Joshua and Joyce\n        joshua_free = get_free_intervals(joshua_busy, day, work_start, work_end)\n        joyce_free = get_free_intervals(joyce_busy, day, work_start, work_end)\n\n        # Find common free intervals\n        common_free = []\n        for j_start, j_end in joshua_free:\n            for q_start, q_end in joyce_free:\n                overlap_start = max(j_start, q_start)\n                overlap_end = min(j_end, q_end)\n                if overlap_start < overlap_end:\n                    common_free.append((overlap_start, overlap_end))\n\n        # Look for a 30-minute slot\n        for start, end in common_free:\n            if end - start >= 30:\n                # Check Joyce's preference\n                if joyce_available(day, start, end):\n                    # Convert to HH:MM format\n                    start_formatted = format_time(start)\n                    end_formatted = format_time(end)\n                    return f\"{day} {start_formatted}-{end_formatted}\"\n\n    return \"No common free time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
