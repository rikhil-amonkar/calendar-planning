            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to schedule a half-hour meeting for five people: Walter, Cynthia, Ann, Catherine, and Kyle. The meeting has to be on Monday between 9 AM and 5 PM. Each person has their own busy times, and I need to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times:\n\n- **Walter** is free all day. That's helpful because he won't restrict the options.\n- **Cynthia** is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 16:00.\n- **Ann** is busy from 10:00 to 11:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n- **Catherine** is busy from 9:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, and 14:30 to 17:00.\n- **Kyle** is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 16:00.\n\nSince Walter is free all day, I can focus on the other four people's schedules.\n\nI need to find a 30-minute slot where none of them are busy. Let's go through the day step by step.\n\n**From 9:00 to 9:30:**\n- Cynthia is busy.\n- Kyle is busy.\n- Catherine is busy.\n- Ann is free, but since others are busy, this slot is out.\n\n**From 9:30 to 10:00:**\n- Cynthia becomes free at 9:30, but Kyle is still busy until 9:30. Wait, Kyle is busy until 9:30, so this slot is partially busy. Not suitable.\n\n**From 10:00 to 10:30:**\n- Cynthia is busy.\n- Kyle is busy until 11:30.\n- Ann is busy from 10:00.\n- Catherine is busy until 11:30.\n- So, this slot is fully booked.\n\n**From 10:30 to 11:00:**\n- Cynthia is free now.\n- Kyle is still busy until 11:30.\n- Ann is busy until 11:00.\n- Catherine is busy until 11:30.\n- Not suitable.\n\n**From 11:00 to 11:30:**\n- Cynthia is free.\n- Kyle is busy until 11:30.\n- Ann is free after 11:00.\n- Catherine is busy until 11:30.\n- Kyle and Catherine are still busy, so this slot is out.\n\n**From 11:30 to 12:00:**\n- Cynthia is free.\n- Kyle is free now.\n- Ann is free.\n- Catherine is free after 11:30.\n- This looks promising. Let's check if there's a 30-minute slot here.\n\nFrom 11:30 to 12:00 is only 30 minutes, so if we start at 11:30, the meeting would end at 12:00. Let's verify:\n\n- **Cynthia:** Free from 10:30 to 13:30, so 11:30 to 12:00 is good.\n- **Ann:** Free from 11:00 to 13:00, so this slot works.\n- **Catherine:** Free from 11:30 to 12:30, so this slot is fine.\n- **Kyle:** Free from 11:30 to 12:00, as he's busy until 11:30 and then free until 12:00.\n\nWait, Kyle is busy until 11:30, so he's available starting at 11:30. So, 11:30 to 12:00 works for everyone.\n\nBut let me double-check the other slots to ensure there's no better time.\n\n**From 12:00 to 12:30:**\n- Cynthia is free until 13:30.\n- Kyle is busy from 12:00 to 12:30.\n- Ann is free until 13:00.\n- Catherine is busy from 12:30 to 13:30.\n- So, Kyle is busy, and Catherine will be busy starting at 12:30. This slot is partially busy.\n\n**From 12:30 to 13:00:**\n- Cynthia is free until 13:30.\n- Kyle is busy until 12:30, so he's available from 12:30.\n- Ann is busy from 13:00.\n- Catherine is busy from 12:30.\n- So, Catherine is busy, making this slot unsuitable.\n\n**From 13:00 to 13:30:**\n- Cynthia is busy from 13:30.\n- Kyle is busy until 14:30.\n- Ann is busy until 13:30.\n- Catherine is busy until 13:30.\n- This slot is fully booked.\n\n**From 13:30 to 14:00:**\n- Cynthia is busy until 14:30.\n- Kyle is busy until 14:30.\n- Ann is busy until 14:00.\n- Catherine is busy from 14:30.\n- Not suitable.\n\n**From 14:00 to 14:30:**\n- Cynthia is busy until 14:30.\n- Kyle is busy until 14:30.\n- Ann is busy until 15:00.\n- Catherine is busy from 14:30.\n- This slot is partially busy.\n\n**From 14:30 to 15:00:**\n- Cynthia is busy until 15:00.\n- Kyle is busy until 15:00.\n- Ann is busy until 15:00.\n- Catherine is busy from 14:30.\n- This slot is fully booked.\n\n**From 15:00 to 15:30:**\n- Cynthia is busy until 16:00.\n- Kyle is busy until 16:00.\n- Ann is free after 15:00.\n- Catherine is busy until 17:00.\n- Not suitable.\n\n**From 15:30 to 16:00:**\n- Cynthia is busy until 16:00.\n- Kyle is busy until 16:00.\n- Ann is free.\n- Catherine is busy.\n- Partially busy.\n\n**From 16:00 to 16:30:**\n- Cynthia is busy until 16:00, so she's free after that.\n- Kyle is busy until 16:00, so he's free after that.\n- Ann is busy until 16:30.\n- Catherine is busy until 17:00.\n- Ann and Catherine are busy, so this slot is out.\n\n**From 16:30 to 17:00:**\n- Cynthia is free after 16:00.\n- Kyle is free after 16:00.\n- Ann is free after 16:30.\n- Catherine is busy until 17:00.\n- Catherine is still busy, so this slot is out.\n\nAfter reviewing all possible slots, the only time that works for everyone is from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM. This slot doesn't overlap with any of their busy times, and it's within the work hours.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes and meeting duration\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define busy intervals for each participant in minutes\n    schedules = {\n        \"Walter\": [],\n        \"Cynthia\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [10*60, 10*60+30], [13*60+30, 14*60+30], [15*60, 16*60]],\n        \"Ann\": [[10*60, 11*60], [13*60, 13*60+30], [14*60, 15*60], [16*60, 16*60+30]],\n        \"Catherine\": [[9*60, 11*60+30], [12*60+30, 13*60+30], [14*60+30, 17*60]],\n        \"Kyle\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [10*60, 11*60+30], [12*60, 12*60+30], [13*60, 14*60+30], [15*60, 16*60]]\n    }\n\n    # Check each possible time slot\n    for time in range(work_start, work_end - duration + 1):\n        # Convert time to HH:MM format\n        current_time = time\n        end_slot = time + duration\n\n        # Check availability for all participants\n        available = True\n        for person, busy_times in schedules.items():\n            for busy_start, busy_end in busy_times:\n                # Check if the current slot overlaps with any busy time\n                if not (end_slot <= busy_start or current_time >= busy_end):\n                    available = False\n                    break\n            if not available:\n                break\n\n        if available:\n            # Convert time to HH:MM format\n            start_hour = current_time // 60\n            start_minute = current_time % 60\n            end_hour = end_slot // 60\n            end_minute = end_slot % 60\n\n            # Format the output\n            return f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per the problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
