            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this meeting scheduling problem. Let's see what the task is. \n\nSo, the task is to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy, and Donald for half an hour on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Each of them has their own busy times, and there's a preference: Billy would like to avoid more meetings after 15:00 on Monday. \n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's schedules to understand their availability.\n\nRaymond is busy:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 11:30 to 12:00\n- 13:00 to 13:30\n- 15:00 to 15:30\n\nBilly is busy:\n- 10:00 to 10:30\n- 12:00 to 13:00\n- 16:30 to 17:00\n\nDonald is busy:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 10:00 to 11:00\n- 12:00 to 13:00\n- 14:00 to 14:30\n- 16:00 to 17:00\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot where none of them are busy, and also respect Billy's preference to avoid meetings after 15:00.\n\nLet me start by listing all the busy intervals for each person and then combine them to see the overall busy times.\n\nRaymond's busy intervals:\n- [9:00, 9:30]\n- [11:30, 12:00]\n- [13:00, 13:30]\n- [15:00, 15:30]\n\nBilly's busy intervals:\n- [10:00, 10:30]\n- [12:00, 13:00]\n- [16:30, 17:00]\n\nDonald's busy intervals:\n- [9:00, 9:30]\n- [10:00, 11:00]\n- [12:00, 13:00]\n- [14:00, 14:30]\n- [16:00, 17:00]\n\nNow, I'll combine all these intervals and sort them to see the overall busy times.\n\nCombined busy intervals:\n- [9:00, 9:30] (Raymond and Donald)\n- [10:00, 10:30] (Billy)\n- [10:00, 11:00] (Donald)\n- [11:30, 12:00] (Raymond)\n- [12:00, 13:00] (Billy and Donald)\n- [13:00, 13:30] (Raymond)\n- [14:00, 14:30] (Donald)\n- [15:00, 15:30] (Raymond)\n- [16:00, 17:00] (Donald)\n- [16:30, 17:00] (Billy)\n\nNow, I'll sort these intervals by start time to make it easier to find gaps.\n\nSorted busy intervals:\n1. [9:00, 9:30]\n2. [10:00, 10:30]\n3. [10:00, 11:00]\n4. [11:30, 12:00]\n5. [12:00, 13:00]\n6. [13:00, 13:30]\n7. [14:00, 14:30]\n8. [15:00, 15:30]\n9. [16:00, 17:00]\n10. [16:30, 17:00]\n\nNext, I need to look for gaps between these intervals where there's at least 30 minutes of free time.\n\nStarting from 9:00, the first busy interval ends at 9:30. The next starts at 10:00. So, the gap is from 9:30 to 10:00. That's 30 minutes. But I need to check if this gap is free for all participants.\n\nWait, let's check if there's any overlap or if all participants are free in this gap.\n\nFrom 9:30 to 10:00, Raymond is free after 9:30, Billy is free until 10:00, and Donald is free after 9:30. So, this slot from 9:30 to 10:00 is available for everyone. But I need to make sure that the meeting can fit in this slot.\n\nSince the meeting is 30 minutes, starting at 9:30 would end at 10:00, which fits perfectly. \n\nBut wait, Billy has a preference to avoid meetings after 15:00. Since this slot is in the morning, it's acceptable. \n\nSo, this seems like a good candidate. But let me check other gaps to ensure there's no earlier slot.\n\nLooking back, the first possible gap is from 9:30 to 10:00. That's the earliest available slot.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other gaps that might be earlier or if I missed something.\n\nAfter 10:00 to 10:30, the next busy interval starts at 10:00, so no gap there. Then, the next busy interval starts at 10:00 and ends at 11:00. So, the next gap would be after 11:00, but let's see.\n\nWait, the next busy interval after 10:00 is [10:00, 11:00] for Donald. So, the gap after 10:30 (Billy's end) would be from 10:30 to 11:00. But Donald is busy until 11:00, so that gap is not available.\n\nNext, after 11:00, the next busy interval starts at 11:30. So, the gap is from 11:00 to 11:30. That's 30 minutes. Let's see if everyone is free then.\n\nRaymond is free until 11:30, Billy is free until 12:00, and Donald is free until 12:00. So, from 11:00 to 11:30, everyone is available. That's another possible slot.\n\nBut since we're looking for the earliest availability, the 9:30 to 10:00 slot is earlier.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that this slot doesn't conflict with any other busy times.\n\nWait, Raymond is busy until 9:30, so starting at 9:30 is the end of his busy time. So, he's available starting at 9:30.\n\nBilly is busy starting at 10:00, so he's available until 10:00.\n\nDonald is busy until 9:30, so he's available starting at 9:30.\n\nSo, from 9:30 to 10:00, all three are available. That seems to be the earliest possible time.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any overlap or if the gap is accurately calculated.\n\nThe first busy interval ends at 9:30, and the next starts at 10:00. So, the gap is from 9:30 to 10:00, which is exactly 30 minutes. Perfect for the meeting.\n\nSo, the proposed time would be 9:30 to 10:00 on Monday.\n\nBut let me make sure that this doesn't conflict with Billy's preference. His preference is to avoid meetings after 15:00, which this slot doesn't violate.\n\nTherefore, the earliest available time that works for everyone is 9:30 to 10:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9,\n        \"end\": 17\n    }\n\n    # Define participants' schedules\n    raymond_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [11.5, 12], [13, 13.5], [15, 15.5]]\n    billy_schedule = [[10, 10.5], [12, 13], [16.5, 17]]\n    donald_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [10, 11], [12, 13], [14, 14.5], [16, 17]]\n\n    # Combine all schedules\n    all_schedules = [\n        raymond_schedule,\n        billy_schedule,\n        donald_schedule\n    ]\n\n    # Flatten and sort all busy intervals\n    all_busy = []\n    for schedule in all_schedules:\n        all_busy.extend(schedule)\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Initialize previous end time to work hours start\n    prev_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n\n    # Billy's preference: avoid meetings after 15:00\n    billy_preference = 15\n\n    # Apply Billy's preference\n    if prev_end < billy_preference:\n        prev_end = billy_preference\n\n    # Iterate through each busy interval\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        # Check for available slot before the busy interval starts\n        if busy_start - prev_end >= 0.5:  # 0.5 hours = 30 minutes\n            # Format the time slots\n            start_time = prev_end\n            end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n            # Convert to HH:MM format\n            start_hh = int(start_time)\n            start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n            end_hh = int(end_time)\n            end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n            # Return the earliest available time\n            return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n        \n        # Update previous end time\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, busy_end)\n\n    # Check for available slot after the last busy interval\n    if work_hours[\"end\"] - prev_end >= 0.5:\n        start_time = prev_end\n        end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n        start_hh = int(start_time)\n        start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n        end_hh = int(end_time)\n        end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n        return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
