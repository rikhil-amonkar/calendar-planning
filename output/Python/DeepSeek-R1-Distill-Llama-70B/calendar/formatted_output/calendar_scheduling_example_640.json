The task is to find a suitable time for a meeting between Bobby and Michael for half an hour, either on Monday or Tuesday, within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00. Both have busy schedules, and we need to find the earliest available slot that works for both.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the busy intervals for both Bobby and Michael on both days.\n\nFor Bobby:\n- Monday: 14:30 to 15:00\n- Tuesday: 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00\n\nFor Michael:\n- Monday: 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00\n- Tuesday: 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00\n\nNow, I'll combine these intervals for each day and sort them to find the gaps where both are free.\n\nStarting with Monday:\n- Combined busy intervals: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00 from Michael; and 14:30-15:00 from Bobby.\n- Sorting these, we have:\n  - 9:00-10:00\n  - 10:30-13:30\n  - 14:00-15:00\n  - 15:30-17:00\n\nLooking for a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00:\n- The first gap is between 8:30 (start of day) and 9:00, but that's before work hours.\n- Next, between 10:00 and 10:30, there's a 30-minute window from 10:00 to 10:30. This slot is free for both Bobby and Michael.\n\nSince we're looking for the earliest availability, Monday at 10:00 to 10:30 seems to be the best option.\n\nTo confirm, I'll check Bobby's schedule on Monday. He's free until 14:30, so 10:00 to 10:30 works. Michael is also free during this time on Monday.\n\nTherefore, the earliest available time that works for both is Monday from 10:00 to 10:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the busy intervals for Bobby and Michael for each day\n    bobby_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(14, 30, 15, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 15, 0), (15, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    michael_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 0, 10, 0), (10, 30, 13, 30), (14, 0, 15, 0), (15, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0, 10, 30), (11, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 14, 0), (15, 0, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\"]\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes in minutes\n\n    for day in days:\n        bobby_busy = bobby_schedule[day]\n        michael_busy = michael_schedule[day]\n\n        # Combine and sort busy intervals\n        combined_busy = sorted(bobby_busy + michael_busy, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        current_time = start_time\n        for busy_start, busy_end in combined_busy:\n            start = busy_start[0] * 60 + busy_start[1]\n            end = busy_end[0] * 60 + busy_end[1]\n            if current_time + meeting_duration <= start:\n                # Found a slot\n                meeting_start = current_time\n                meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n                return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n            current_time = max(current_time, end)\n\n        # Check if there's time after the last busy interval\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            meeting_start = current_time\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
