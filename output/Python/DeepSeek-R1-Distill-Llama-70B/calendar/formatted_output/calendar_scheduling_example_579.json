            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to solve this problem where I have to schedule a meeting between Christine and Helen on Monday, but Helen can't meet after 15:00. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Christine's schedule. She's busy from 11:00 to 11:30 and from 15:00 to 15:30. So, Christine is free before 11:00, between 11:30 and 15:00, and after 15:30.\n\nNext, Helen's schedule is a bit more complicated. She's busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. Plus, she can't meet after 15:00. So, Helen is free between 10:30 and 11:00, 11:30 and 12:00, 12:30 and 13:30, and 16:00 to 16:30, but she can't meet after 15:00, so the last slot is out.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that works for both. Let's see:\n\n- Before 11:00: Christine is free, but Helen is busy until 10:30. So, maybe between 10:30 and 11:00? That's a 30-minute window, which is exactly what we need. Let me check if both are free then. Christine is free, and Helen is free from 10:30 to 11:00. Perfect, that's a possible slot.\n\n- Between 11:30 and 15:00: Christine is free, but Helen is busy from 11:30 to 12:30 and 13:30 to 16:00. So, the only free time for Helen here is between 12:30 and 13:30. But Christine is free until 15:00, so from 12:30 to 13:30, both are free. That's another possible slot.\n\n- After 15:30: Christine is free, but Helen can't meet after 15:00, so this is out.\n\nSo, there are two possible slots: 10:30 to 11:00 and 12:30 to 13:30. Since the problem asks for the earliest availability, I should choose the earlier one, which is 10:30 to 11:00.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says Helen can't meet after 15:00, but she has a busy slot from 16:30 to 17:00, which is after 15:00. So, our earlier slots are within the allowed time.\n\nI think 10:30 to 11:00 is the best choice as it's the earliest time that works for both.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the busy intervals for Christine and Helen in minutes since midnight\n    christine_busy = [(11 * 60 + 0, 11 * 60 + 30),  # 11:00 to 11:30\n                      (15 * 60 + 0, 15 * 60 + 30)]  # 15:00 to 15:30\n\n    helen_busy = [(9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60 + 30),  # 9:30 to 10:30\n                  (11 * 60 + 0, 11 * 60 + 30),  # 11:00 to 11:30\n                  (12 * 60 + 0, 12 * 60 + 30),  # 12:00 to 12:30\n                  (13 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60 + 0),  # 13:30 to 16:00\n                  (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60 + 0)]  # 16:30 to 17:00\n\n    day = \"Monday\"\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes in minutes\n\n    # Combine and sort all busy intervals\n    all_busy = christine_busy + helen_busy\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Check for available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start:\n            # Found a slot\n            meeting_start = current_time\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n        current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n    # Check if there's time after the last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        meeting_start = current_time\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n        return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
