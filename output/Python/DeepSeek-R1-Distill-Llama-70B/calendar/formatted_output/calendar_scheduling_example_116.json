            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to schedule a meeting for four people: Adam, John, Stephanie, and Anna. The meeting should be half an hour long, and it has to be on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. \n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times:\n\n- **Adam**: 14:00 to 15:00\n- **John**: 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00\n- **Stephanie**: 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00\n- **Anna**: 9:30 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00\n\nAnd Anna prefers not to meet before 14:30 on Monday. So, I need to find a time slot that's free for all four, preferably after 14:30.\n\nLet me convert all these times into minutes since midnight to make it easier to handle:\n\n- **Adam**: 14:00 = 840 minutes, 15:00 = 900 minutes\n- **John**: 13:00 = 780, 13:30 = 810; 14:00 = 840, 14:30 = 870; 15:30 = 930, 16:00 = 960; 16:30 = 990, 17:00 = 1020\n- **Stephanie**: 9:30 = 570, 10:00 = 600; 10:30 = 630, 11:00 = 660; 11:30 = 690, 16:00 = 960; 16:30 = 990, 17:00 = 1020\n- **Anna**: 9:30 = 570, 10:00 = 600; 12:00 = 720, 12:30 = 750; 13:00 = 780, 15:30 = 930; 16:30 = 990, 17:00 = 1020\n\nNow, I'll list all the busy intervals for each person:\n\n**Adam's busy intervals:**\n- (840, 900)\n\n**John's busy intervals:**\n- (780, 810)\n- (840, 870)\n- (930, 960)\n- (990, 1020)\n\n**Stephanie's busy intervals:**\n- (570, 600)\n- (630, 660)\n- (690, 960)\n- (990, 1020)\n\n**Anna's busy intervals:**\n- (570, 600)\n- (720, 750)\n- (780, 930)\n- (990, 1020)\n\nNext, I'll combine all these intervals into a single list and sort them by start time. This will help identify overlapping busy times.\n\nCombined busy intervals:\n- (570, 600) - Stephanie\n- (570, 600) - Anna\n- (630, 660) - Stephanie\n- (690, 960) - Stephanie\n- (720, 750) - Anna\n- (780, 810) - John\n- (780, 930) - Anna\n- (840, 870) - John\n- (840, 900) - Adam\n- (930, 960) - John\n- (990, 1020) - John\n- (990, 1020) - Stephanie\n- (990, 1020) - Anna\n\nAfter sorting, the intervals look like this:\n\n1. 570-600 (Stephanie)\n2. 570-600 (Anna)\n3. 630-660 (Stephanie)\n4. 690-960 (Stephanie)\n5. 720-750 (Anna)\n6. 780-810 (John)\n7. 780-930 (Anna)\n8. 840-870 (John)\n9. 840-900 (Adam)\n10. 930-960 (John)\n11. 990-1020 (John)\n12. 990-1020 (Stephanie)\n13. 990-1020 (Anna)\n\nNow, I'll merge any overlapping intervals to simplify:\n\n- 570-600 (both Stephanie and Anna)\n- 630-660 (Stephanie)\n- 690-960 (Stephanie)\n- 720-750 (Anna)\n- 780-930 (Anna)\n- 840-870 (John)\n- 840-900 (Adam)\n- 930-960 (John)\n- 990-1020 (John, Stephanie, Anna)\n\nBut I'm noticing that some intervals overlap. For example, 690-960 (Stephanie) overlaps with 720-750 (Anna) and 780-930 (Anna). So, merging these:\n\n- 570-600\n- 630-660\n- 690-960\n- 780-930\n- 840-870\n- 840-900\n- 930-960\n- 990-1020\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try merging them properly:\n\nStart with 570-600.\n\nNext, 630-660 doesn't overlap with 570-600, so it's separate.\n\nThen, 690-960 overlaps with 720-750 and 780-930, so the merged interval becomes 690-960.\n\nNext, 840-870 is within 690-960, so no change.\n\nSimilarly, 840-900 is also within 690-960.\n\n930-960 is within 690-960.\n\nFinally, 990-1020 is a separate interval.\n\nSo, the merged busy intervals are:\n\n1. 570-600\n2. 630-660\n3. 690-960\n4. 990-1020\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot that's free for all four people, preferably after 14:30 (which is 870 minutes).\n\nLooking at the merged intervals:\n\n- 570-600: busy\n- 630-660: busy\n- 690-960: busy\n- 990-1020: busy\n\nSo, the available slots are:\n\n- 600-630\n- 660-690\n- 960-990\n\nBut Anna prefers not to meet before 14:30 (870 minutes), so 600-630 and 660-690 are before 14:30. Therefore, the earliest available slot after 14:30 is 960-990.\n\nWait, 960-990 is from 16:00 to 16:30. But looking back, 960 is 16:00, and 990 is 16:30.\n\nBut Anna's busy intervals include 16:30-17:00, but 990-1020 is busy for Anna, John, and Stephanie. So, 960-990 is free for all?\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the merged intervals, 690-960 is busy. So, 960-990 is free before the last busy interval starts at 990.\n\nBut wait, 960 is 16:00, and 990 is 16:30.\n\nLooking back at individual schedules:\n\n- **Adam**: Free after 15:00 (900 minutes)\n- **John**: Busy until 16:00 (960 minutes)\n- **Stephanie**: Busy until 16:00 (960 minutes)\n- **Anna**: Busy until 15:30 (930 minutes) and then 16:30-17:00\n\nSo, from 16:00 to 16:30 (960-990 minutes), everyone seems to be free except Anna has a preference not to meet before 14:30, which is 870 minutes. Since 960 is after 870, this slot is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the meeting can be scheduled from 16:00 to 16:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    adam_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(14*60, 15*60)]  # 14:00 to 15:00\n    }\n\n    john_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(13*60, 13.5*60), (14*60, 14.5*60), \n                   (15.5*60, 16*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)]  # 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n    }\n\n    stephanie_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9.5*60, 10*60), (10.5*60, 11*60), \n                   (11.5*60, 16*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)]  # 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n    }\n\n    anna_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9.5*60, 10*60), (12*60, 12.5*60), \n                   (13*60, 15.5*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)]  # 9:30-10:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-15:30, 16:30-17:00\n    }\n\n    day = 'Monday'\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    busy_intervals = []\n    for interval in adam_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Adam'))\n    for interval in john_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'John'))\n    for interval in stephanie_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Stephanie'))\n    for interval in anna_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Anna'))\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    busy_intervals.sort()\n\n    # Merge overlapping intervals\n    merged = []\n    for interval in busy_intervals:\n        if not merged:\n            merged.append(interval)\n        else:\n            last = merged[-1]\n            if interval[0] <= last[1]:\n                # Overlapping, merge them\n                new_start = last[0]\n                new_end = max(last[1], interval[1])\n                merged[-1] = (new_start, new_end, last[2])\n            else:\n                merged.append(interval)\n\n    # Find available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for interval in merged:\n        busy_start, busy_end, person = interval\n        if current_time < busy_start:\n            if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                # Found a suitable time\n                start_h = current_time // 60\n                start_m = current_time % 60\n                end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n                print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                return\n        current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n    # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        start_h = current_time // 60\n        start_m = current_time % 60\n        end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n        end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n        print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n        return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
