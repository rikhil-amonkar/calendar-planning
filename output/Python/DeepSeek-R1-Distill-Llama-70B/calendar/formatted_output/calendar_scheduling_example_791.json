            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to schedule a half-hour meeting between Nicole and Ruth on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Both have pretty busy schedules, and there are some constraints we need to consider.\n\nFirst, let's look at Nicole's schedule:\n\n- **Monday**: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 13:30, and 14:30 to 15:30.\n- **Tuesday**: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 13:30, and 14:30 to 15:30.\n- **Wednesday**: Busy from 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 17:00.\n\nNow, Ruth's schedule:\n\n- **Monday**: Fully booked all day.\n- **Tuesday**: Fully booked all day.\n- **Wednesday**: Busy from 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n- Additionally, Ruth doesn't want to meet on Wednesday after 13:30.\n\nGiven these schedules, the first thing I notice is that both Nicole and Ruth are completely unavailable on Monday and Tuesday. So, the only possible day for the meeting is Wednesday.\n\nNow, focusing on Wednesday:\n\n- **Nicole's availability**: \n  - Free from 9:00 to 10:00 (since she's busy starting at 10:00).\n  - Free from 11:00 to 12:30 (busy from 10:00 to 11:00 and then from 12:30 onwards).\n  - Free from 15:00 to 16:00 (busy until 15:00 and then again from 16:00 to 17:00).\n  - Free from 16:30 to 17:00 (since she's busy until 16:00 and then again at 16:00 to 17:00).\n\n- **Ruth's availability on Wednesday**:\n  - Free from 10:30 to 11:00.\n  - Free from 11:30 to 12:00.\n  - Free from 12:30 to 13:30.\n  - Free from 15:30 to 16:00.\n  - Free from 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nBut Ruth has a constraint: she doesn't want to meet after 13:30 on Wednesday. So, we can only consider times up to 13:30.\n\nLooking at the overlapping free times before 13:30:\n\n- **10:30 to 11:00**: Nicole is free from 9:00 to 10:00, but busy from 10:00 to 11:00. So, this slot doesn't work.\n- **11:30 to 12:00**: Nicole is free from 11:00 to 12:30, so this slot is available.\n- **12:30 to 13:30**: Nicole is busy from 12:30 onwards, so this slot doesn't work.\n\nThe only overlapping available slot is from 11:30 to 12:00. This fits within Ruth's constraint of not meeting after 13:30 and also works with Nicole's schedule.\n\nSo, the proposed meeting time is Wednesday from 11:30 to 12:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the busy intervals for Nicole and Ruth for each day\n    nicole_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (13, 0, 13, 30), (14, 30, 15, 30)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (11, 30, 13, 30), (14, 30, 15, 30)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(10, 0, 11, 0), (12, 30, 15, 0), (16, 0, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    ruth_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9, 0, 10, 30), (11, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 30, 15, 30), (16, 0, 16, 30)]\n    }\n\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes in minutes\n\n    # Ruth's additional constraint: no meetings on Wednesday after 13:30\n    ruth_constraint = {\n        \"Wednesday\": (13, 30, 17, 0)\n    }\n\n    for day in days:\n        nicole_busy = nicole_schedule[day]\n        ruth_busy = ruth_schedule[day]\n\n        # Apply Ruth's additional constraint for Wednesday\n        if day == \"Wednesday\":\n            ruth_busy += [ruth_constraint[day]]\n\n        # Combine and sort busy intervals\n        combined_busy = sorted(nicole_busy + ruth_busy, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        current_time = start_time\n        for interval in combined_busy:\n            start, end = interval[0] * 60 + interval[1], interval[2] * 60 + interval[3]\n            if current_time + meeting_duration <= start:\n                # Found a slot\n                meeting_start = current_time\n                meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n                return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n            current_time = max(current_time, end)\n\n        # Check if there's time after the last busy interval\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            meeting_start = current_time\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
