            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to find a suitable time for Margaret, Donna, and Helen to have a half-hour meeting on Monday. Let's look at their schedules.\n\nMargaret is busy from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, and 15:00 to 15:30. So she's free between 12:00 and 13:00, and then again from 13:30 to 15:00, but Helen doesn't want to meet after 13:30. So Margaret's available times before 13:30 are 12:00-13:00 and 13:30-15:00, but considering Helen's constraint, only up to 13:30.\n\nDonna is busy from 14:30 to 15:00 and 16:00 to 16:30. So her available times are 9:00-14:30 and 15:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. But since Helen doesn't want to meet after 13:30, Donna's available times before 13:30 are 9:00-14:30, but limited by others.\n\nHelen is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 17:00. She doesn't want to meet after 13:30, so her available times are 9:30-10:00, 11:30-13:00, and 14:00-14:30.\n\nNow, let's find overlapping free times before 13:30.\n\nMargaret is free 12:00-13:00 and 13:30-15:00, but considering Helen's constraint, only up to 13:30.\n\nDonna is free 9:00-14:30.\n\nHelen is free 9:30-10:00, 11:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30.\n\nLooking for overlaps:\n\nFrom 12:00 to 13:00, Margaret and Donna are free, but Helen is busy until 13:00.\n\nFrom 13:00 to 13:30, Margaret is busy, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, Margaret is free from 12:00 to 13:00, and Helen is free until 13:00. So the overlapping time would be 12:00 to 13:00, but Helen is busy until 13:00. So maybe 12:00 to 13:00 doesn't work.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nMargaret's free times: 12:00-13:00 and 13:30-15:00.\n\nHelen's free times: 9:30-10:00, 11:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30.\n\nDonna's free times: 9:00-14:30.\n\nSo overlapping times before 13:30 would be:\n\n- 12:00-13:00: Margaret is free, Helen is free until 13:00, Donna is free.\n\nBut at 12:00-13:00, Helen is busy until 13:00, so the meeting can't start at 12:00 because Helen is busy until 13:00.\n\nWait, Helen is free from 11:30 to 13:00, so she's available from 11:30 to 13:00.\n\nMargaret is free from 12:00 to 13:00.\n\nDonna is free from 9:00 to 14:30.\n\nSo the overlapping time is 12:00 to 13:00.\n\nBut Helen is available from 11:30 to 13:00, Margaret from 12:00 to 13:00, and Donna from 9:00 to 14:30.\n\nSo the earliest available slot is 12:00 to 13:00.\n\nWait, but the user's solution says 11:30 to 12:00. Let me see.\n\nHelen is free from 11:30 to 13:00.\n\nMargaret is free from 12:00 to 13:00.\n\nDonna is free from 9:00 to 14:30.\n\nSo the overlapping time starts at 12:00, but maybe there's an earlier slot.\n\nWait, Margaret is busy until 12:00, so before that, she's busy. So the earliest they can all meet is at 12:00.\n\nBut the user's solution says 11:30 to 12:00, which might not work because Margaret is busy until 12:00.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding Margaret's schedule. Let me check again.\n\nMargaret's blocked times: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30.\n\nSo she's free from 12:00 to 13:00, and 13:30 to 15:00.\n\nSo the earliest overlapping time is 12:00 to 13:00.\n\nBut the user's solution is 11:30 to 12:00, which might not work because Margaret is busy until 12:00.\n\nSo perhaps the correct time is 12:00 to 13:00.\n\nBut the user's solution says 11:30 to 12:00, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a slot earlier.\n\nLet me list the busy times:\n\nMargaret:\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 11:30-12:00\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 15:00-15:30\n\nDonna:\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nHelen:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-11:30\n- 13:00-14:00\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 15:30-17:00\n\nAnd Helen doesn't want to meet after 13:30.\n\nSo, let's look for times before 13:30.\n\nPossible slots:\n\n- 9:30-10:00: Margaret is free? No, Margaret is busy from 9:00-10:00, so 9:30-10:00 is busy.\n\n- 10:00-10:30: Margaret is free from 10:00-10:30? No, Margaret is busy from 10:30-11:00, but free before that.\n\nWait, Margaret is busy from 10:30-11:00, so she's free from 10:00-10:30.\n\nHelen is busy from 10:00-11:30, so she's busy during 10:00-10:30.\n\nDonna is free from 9:00-14:30.\n\nSo 10:00-10:30: Margaret is free, Helen is busy, Donna is free. So no.\n\n- 11:00-11:30: Margaret is busy from 10:30-11:00, so free from 11:00-11:30.\n\nHelen is busy from 10:00-11:30, so busy during 11:00-11:30.\n\nDonna is free.\n\nSo no.\n\n- 11:30-12:00: Margaret is busy until 12:00.\n\nHelen is free from 11:30-13:00.\n\nDonna is free.\n\nSo Margaret is busy until 12:00, so 11:30-12:00 is busy for her.\n\n- 12:00-13:00: Margaret is free, Helen is free until 13:00, Donna is free.\n\nSo 12:00-13:00 is a possible slot.\n\nBut the user's solution says 11:30-12:00, which may not work because Margaret is busy until 12:00.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is 12:00-13:00.\n\nBut the user's solution says 11:30-12:00, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps Margaret's schedule allows her to be free at 11:30-12:00.\n\nLet me check Margaret's schedule again.\n\nMargaret's blocked times: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30.\n\nSo she's busy from 11:30-12:00.\n\nSo she's not free at 11:30-12:00.\n\nSo the earliest available slot is 12:00-13:00.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 12:00-13:00.\n</think>\n\nTo schedule a meeting for Margaret, Donna, and Helen on Monday, we need to find a time that fits within their availability and constraints. \n\n- **Margaret's Availability**: \n  - Busy: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30\n  - Free: 12:00-13:00, 13:30-15:00\n\n- **Donna's Availability**:\n  - Busy: 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30\n  - Free: 9:00-14:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n\n- **Helen's Availability**:\n  - Busy: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00\n  - Free: 9:30-10:00, 11:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30\n\nConsidering Helen's preference not to meet after 13:30, the latest possible start time is 13:00.\n\n### Overlapping Availability:\n- **12:00-13:00**: Margaret is free, Helen is free until 13:00, and Donna is free.\n\nThis slot fits all participants' schedules and constraints.\n\n### Solution Code:\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    margaret_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 10*60), (10.5*60, 11*60), (11.5*60, 12*60), \n                   (13*60, 13.5*60), (15*60, 15.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    donna_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(14.5*60, 15*60), (16*60, 16.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    helen_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 9.5*60), (10*60, 11.5*60), (13*60, 14*60), \n                   (14.5*60, 15*60), (15.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    day = 'Monday'\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    busy_intervals = []\n    for interval in margaret_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Margaret'))\n    for interval in donna_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Donna'))\n    for interval in helen_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Helen'))\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    busy_intervals.sort()\n\n    # Find available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end, person in busy_intervals:\n        if current_time < busy_start:\n            if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                # Found a suitable time\n                start_h = current_time // 60\n                start_m = current_time % 60\n                end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n                print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                return\n        current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n    # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        start_h = current_time // 60\n        start_m = current_time % 60\n        end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n        end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n        print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n        return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
