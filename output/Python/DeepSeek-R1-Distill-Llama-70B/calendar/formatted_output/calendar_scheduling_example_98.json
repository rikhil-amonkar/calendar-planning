            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Juan, Marilyn, and Ronald on Monday. The meeting has to be half an hour long, and it needs to be between 9:00 and 17:00. Plus, Juan can't meet after 16:00. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times:\n\n- Juan is busy from 9:00 to 10:30 and from 15:30 to 16:00.\n- Marilyn is busy from 11:00 to 11:30 and from 12:30 to 13:00.\n- Ronald is busy from 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, and 14:00 to 16:30.\n\nSo, I need to find a 30-minute slot where none of them are busy and also respect that Juan can't meet after 16:00.\n\nLet me visualize the day from 9:00 to 17:00 and mark everyone's busy times.\n\nStarting from 9:00 to 10:30, all three are busy. So that's out.\n\nFrom 10:30 to 11:00, Juan is free, Marilyn is free, and Ronald is free. That's a possible slot. Wait, but it's only 30 minutes? From 10:30 to 11:00 is 30 minutes. So that could work.\n\nBut let's check the rest to see if there's another option in case that slot doesn't work for some reason.\n\nFrom 11:00 to 11:30, Marilyn is busy. So that's out.\n\nFrom 11:30 to 12:00, Juan is free, Marilyn is free, and Ronald is free. That's another 30-minute slot.\n\nFrom 12:00 to 12:30, Ronald is busy. So that's out.\n\nFrom 12:30 to 13:00, Marilyn is busy. So that's out.\n\nFrom 13:00 to 13:30, Ronald is busy. So that's out.\n\nFrom 13:30 to 14:00, Juan is free, Marilyn is free, and Ronald is free. That's another possible slot.\n\nFrom 14:00 to 16:30, Ronald is busy. So that's out.\n\nFrom 16:30 to 17:00, Juan can't meet after 16:00, so that's out.\n\nSo, the possible slots are:\n\n1. 10:30 to 11:00\n2. 11:30 to 12:00\n3. 13:30 to 14:00\n\nNow, I need to choose one of these slots. Since the problem says there's a solution that works for everyone, any of these should be acceptable. Maybe the earliest available slot would be best to allow more flexibility for the rest of the day.\n\nSo, the earliest slot is 10:30 to 11:00. That should work for everyone.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the meeting duration is exactly 30 minutes. 10:30 to 11:00 is exactly 30 minutes, so that's good.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that Juan's constraint of not meeting after 16:00 is respected, which it is in this slot.\n\nOkay, so I think 10:30 to 11:00 on Monday is a suitable time for the meeting.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each participant in decimal hours\n    schedules = {\n        'Juan': [(9.0, 10.5), (15.5, 16.0)],\n        'Marilyn': [(11.0, 11.5), (12.5, 13.0)],\n        'Ronald': [(9.0, 10.5), (12.0, 12.5), (13.0, 13.5), (14.0, 16.5)]\n    }\n\n    # Work hours in decimal\n    start_time = 9.0\n    end_time = 17.0\n\n    # Iterate through possible start times in 30-minute increments\n    for hour in range(9, 17):\n        for minute in [0, 30]:\n            start = hour + minute / 60.0\n            end = start + 0.5  # 30-minute meeting\n\n            # Ensure the meeting doesn't go beyond work hours\n            if end > end_time:\n                continue\n\n            # Check if all participants are free during this slot\n            all_free = True\n            for name, busy_times in schedules.items():\n                for busy_start, busy_end in busy_times:\n                    # Check for overlap\n                    if not (end <= busy_start or start >= busy_end):\n                        all_free = False\n                        break\n                if not all_free:\n                    break\n\n            if all_free:\n                # Format the time as HH:MM:HH:MM\n                start_h = int(start)\n                start_m = int((start - start_h) * 60)\n                end_h = int(end)\n                end_m = int((end - end_h) * 60)\n                return f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}:{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No available slot found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(f\"Meeting scheduled for {meeting_time} on Monday.\")\n```",
