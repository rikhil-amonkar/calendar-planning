The meeting should be half an hour long, and it has to be between 9:00 and 17:00, Monday through Thursday. There are several constraints here, so I need to carefully consider each one.\n\nFirst, let's list out the constraints:\n\n1. **Betty's Availability:**\n   - **Monday:** Busy from 10:00 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n   - **Tuesday:** Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n   - **Wednesday:** Busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30.\n   - **Thursday:** Busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n   - **Preferences:** Cannot meet on Monday. Cannot meet on Tuesday. Cannot meet on Thursday before 15:00.\n\n2. **Scott's Availability:**\n   - **Monday:** Busy from 9:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n   - **Tuesday:** Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n   - **Wednesday:** Busy from 9:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n   - **Thursday:** Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n   - **Preferences:** Would like to avoid more meetings on Wednesday.\n\n3. **Meeting Duration:** 30 minutes.\n\n4. **Work Hours:** 9:00 to 17:00.\n\n5. **Days to Consider:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n\nGiven Betty's constraints, she cannot meet on Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday before 15:00. This leaves Wednesday and Thursday after 15:00 as potential days for the meeting. However, Scott prefers to avoid meetings on Wednesday, so ideally, we should find a time on Thursday after 15:00 that works for both.\n\nLet's analyze each day:\n\n- **Monday:** Betty cannot meet, so we can skip this day.\n\n- **Tuesday:** Betty cannot meet, so we skip this day as well.\n\n- **Wednesday:** Betty is available, but Scott wants to avoid meetings on this day. However, since Betty has limited availability on other days, we might still need to consider Wednesday if no other options are available. Let's check Betty and Scott's schedules for Wednesday:\n\n  - **Betty's Availability on Wednesday:** Free from 10:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 16:30.\n  \n  - **Scott's Availability on Wednesday:** Busy from 9:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n  \n  - **Potential Slots on Wednesday:** \n    - 10:30 to 11:00 (but Scott is busy until 12:30)\n    - 14:30 to 15:00 (Scott is busy from 14:00 to 14:30 and 15:00 to 15:30)\n    - 15:30 to 16:00 (Scott is busy from 16:00 to 16:30)\n  \n  It seems challenging to find a slot on Wednesday that works for both.\n\n- **Thursday:** Betty cannot meet before 15:00, so we need to look for slots from 15:00 onwards.\n\n  - **Betty's Availability on Thursday:** Free from 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, and 15:30 to 16:30, and 17:00.\n  \n  - **Scott's Availability on Thursday:** Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n  \n  - **Potential Slots on Thursday after 15:00:** \n    - 15:00 to 15:30 (Scott is busy from 15:00 to 16:00)\n    - 16:00 to 16:30 (Scott is busy from 16:30 to 17:00, but 16:00 to 16:30 might be free)\n    - 16:30 to 17:00 (Scott is busy)\n\n  So, 16:00 to 16:30 seems like a possible slot. Let's verify:\n\n  - **Betty's Schedule on Thursday:** Busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, she's free from 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, and 15:30 to 16:30.\n\n  - **Scott's Schedule on Thursday:** Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, he's free from 10:30 to 11:00, 13:00 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n\n  The overlapping free slot is from 16:00 to 16:30. This slot is after 15:00, respecting Betty's constraint, and it's on Thursday, which Scott prefers over Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, the proposed meeting time is Thursday from 16:00 to 16:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes and meeting duration\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define busy intervals for each participant in minutes\n    betty_busy = {\n        \"Monday\": [[10*60, 10*60+30], [13*60+30, 14*60], [15*60, 15*60+30], [16*60, 16*60+30]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [11*60+30, 12*60], [12*60+30, 13*60], [13*60+30, 14*60], [16*60+30, 17*60]],\n        \"Wednesday\": [[9*60+30, 10*60+30], [13*60, 13*60+30], [14*60, 14*60+30]],\n        \"Thursday\": [[9*60+30, 10*60], [11*60+30, 12*60], [14*60, 14*60+30], [15*60, 15*60+30], [16*60+30, 17*60]]\n    }\n\n    scott_busy = {\n        \"Monday\": [[9*60+30, 15*60], [15*60+30, 16*60], [16*60+30, 17*60]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [10*60, 11*60], [11*60+30, 12*60], [12*60+30, 13*60+30], [14*60, 15*60], [16*60, 16*60+30]],\n        \"Wednesday\": [[9*60+30, 12*60+30], [13*60, 13*60+30], [14*60, 14*60+30], [15*60, 15*60+30], [16*60, 16*60+30]],\n        \"Thursday\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [10*60, 10*60+30], [11*60, 12*60], [12*60+30, 13*60], [15*60, 16*60], [16*60+30, 17*60]]\n    }\n\n    # Days to check (Betty cannot meet on Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday before 15:00)\n    days = [\"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\"]\n\n    # Scott's preference to avoid meetings on Wednesday\n    # We'll prioritize Thursday first\n\n    # Check Thursday first\n    day = \"Thursday\"\n    # Only consider times after 15:00 (Betty's constraint)\n    start_time = max(work_start, 15*60)  # 15:00 in minutes\n\n    # Get busy intervals for the current day\n    betty_busy_times = betty_busy.get(day, [])\n    scott_busy_times = scott_busy.get(day, [])\n\n    # Combine busy intervals\n    all_busy = betty_busy_times + scott_busy_times\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Check each possible time slot after 15:00\n    for time in range(start_time, work_end - duration + 1):\n        current_time = time\n        end_slot = time + duration\n\n        # Check availability for both participants\n        available = True\n        for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n            if not (end_slot <= busy_start or current_time >= busy_end):\n                available = False\n                break\n\n        if available:\n            # Convert time to HH:MM format\n            start_hour = current_time // 60\n            start_minute = current_time % 60\n            end_hour = end_slot // 60\n            end_minute = end_slot % 60\n\n            return f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    # If no time found on Thursday, check Wednesday (though Scott prefers to avoid it)\n    day = \"Wednesday\"\n    # Get busy intervals for the current day\n    betty_busy_times = betty_busy.get(day, [])\n    scott_busy_times = scott_busy.get(day, [])\n\n    # Combine busy intervals\n    all_busy = betty_busy_times + scott_busy_times\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Check each possible time slot\n    for time in range(work_start, work_end - duration + 1):\n        current_time = time\n        end_slot = time + duration\n\n        # Check availability for both participants\n        available = True\n        for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n            if not (end_slot <= busy_start or current_time >= busy_end):\n                available = False\n                break\n\n        if available:\n            # Convert time to HH:MM format\n            start_hour = current_time // 60\n            start_minute = current_time % 60\n            end_hour = end_slot // 60\n            end_minute = end_slot % 60\n\n            return f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per the problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
