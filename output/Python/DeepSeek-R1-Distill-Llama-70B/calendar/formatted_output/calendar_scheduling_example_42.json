They all have various meetings and blocks in their calendars on Monday, and we need to find a one-hour slot that works for everyone between 9:00 and 17:00.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times to visualize their availability.\n\nJulie's schedule:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 11:00 to 11:30\n- 12:00 to 12:30\n- 13:30 to 14:00\n- 16:00 to 17:00\n\nSean's schedule:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 13:00 to 13:30\n- 15:00 to 15:30\n- 16:00 to 16:30\n\nLori's schedule:\n- 10:00 to 10:30\n- 11:00 to 13:00\n- 15:30 to 17:00\n\nNow, I need to find a one-hour window where none of them have any meetings or blocks. Let's break down the day into possible time slots and check each person's availability.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n- 9:00 to 10:00: Julie and Sean are busy until 9:30. Lori is free until 10:00. But since Julie and Sean are busy until 9:30, this slot isn't available.\n\nNext, from 10:00 to 11:00:\n- Julie is free from 9:30 to 11:00.\n- Sean is free from 9:30 to 13:00, except his meeting at 13:00.\n- Lori is busy from 10:00 to 10:30. So, from 10:30 to 11:00, Lori is free, but Julie is busy from 11:00 to 11:30. This slot is partially overlapping with Julie's busy time.\n\nFrom 11:00 to 12:00:\n- Julie is busy from 11:00 to 11:30.\n- Sean is free.\n- Lori is busy until 13:00. So, this slot doesn't work.\n\nFrom 12:00 to 13:00:\n- Julie is busy from 12:00 to 12:30.\n- Sean is free until 13:00.\n- Lori is busy until 13:00. So, this slot is partially blocked.\n\nFrom 13:00 to 14:00:\n- Julie is busy from 13:30 to 14:00.\n- Sean is busy from 13:00 to 13:30.\n- Lori is free from 13:00 to 15:30. So, the slot from 13:30 to 14:00 is partially blocked by Julie and Sean.\n\nFrom 14:00 to 15:00:\n- Julie is free from 14:00 to 16:00.\n- Sean is free from 13:30 to 15:00.\n- Lori is free from 13:00 to 15:30. This looks promising. Let's check for any overlaps.\n\nLooking at 14:00 to 15:00:\n- Julie: Free\n- Sean: Free (since his next meeting is at 15:00)\n- Lori: Free\n\nThis slot seems to work for everyone. Let's double-check:\n\n- Julie's next busy time starts at 16:00.\n- Sean's next meeting is at 15:00, so he's free until then.\n- Lori is free until 15:30.\n\nSo, 14:00 to 15:00 is a valid one-hour slot where all three are available.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Define the work hours and meeting duration\nwork_start = \"09:00\"\nwork_end = \"17:00\"\nmeeting_duration = 60  # in minutes\n\n# Define participants' schedules\nparticipants = {\n    \"Julie\": [(\"09:00\", \"09:30\"), (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"), (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"), (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"), (\"16:00\", \"17:00\")],\n    \"Sean\": [(\"09:00\", \"09:30\"), (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"), (\"15:00\", \"15:30\"), (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")],\n    \"Lori\": [(\"10:00\", \"10:30\"), (\"11:00\", \"13:00\"), (\"15:30\", \"17:00\")]\n}\n\n# Convert time strings to minutes since midnight for easier calculations\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n# Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    minutes = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n# Find the earliest available time slot that fits all constraints\nwork_start_minutes = time_to_minutes(work_start)\nwork_end_minutes = time_to_minutes(work_end)\nmeeting_end_minutes = work_start_minutes + meeting_duration\n\n# Initialize available time as the entire work day\navailable_start = work_start_minutes\navailable_end = work_end_minutes\n\n# Check each participant's schedule to find common free time\nfor name, schedule in participants.items():\n    # Sort the schedule by start time\n    sorted_schedule = sorted(schedule, key=lambda x: time_to_minutes(x[0]))\n    \n    # Initialize with the work start time\n    current_start = work_start_minutes\n    \n    for slot in sorted_schedule:\n        slot_start = time_to_minutes(slot[0])\n        slot_end = time_to_minutes(slot[1])\n        \n        # If the slot starts after the current available start, update the available start\n        if slot_start > current_start:\n            current_start = max(current_start, slot_end)\n    \n    # Update the overall available time\n    available_start = max(available_start, current_start)\n\n# Ensure the meeting time is within work hours\nif available_start + meeting_duration > work_end_minutes:\n    print(\"No available time slot found within constraints.\")\nelse:\n    meeting_start = available_start\n    meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n    print(f\"Proposed meeting time: {minutes_to_time(meeting_start)}:{minutes_to_time(meeting_end)} on Monday\")\n```",
