            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to figure out how to schedule a meeting for Jacqueline, Harold, Arthur, and Kelly on Monday. The meeting should be half an hour long, between 9 AM and 5 PM. \n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times to see when they're all free. \n\nJacqueline is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, and 15:30-16:00. So she's free from 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-15:30, and after 16:00.\n\nHarold is busy from 10:00-10:30, 13:00-13:30, and 15:00-17:00. He also doesn't want to meet after 13:00, so we can ignore any times after that.\n\nArthur is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-12:30, 14:30-15:00, and 15:30-17:00. His free slots are 9:30-10:00, 12:30-14:30, and 15:00-15:30.\n\nKelly is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 14:00-15:00, and 15:30-16:00. So she's free from 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30, and after 16:00.\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute window where all four are free. Let's look for overlapping free times.\n\nFrom 9:30-10:00: Jacqueline, Arthur, and Kelly are free, but Harold is busy until 10:00.\n\nAt 10:00, Harold is busy until 10:30, so that's out.\n\nLooking at 11:00-11:30: Jacqueline is busy, so that's not possible.\n\nFrom 12:30-13:00: Jacqueline is busy, so that's out.\n\nAt 13:00, Harold is busy until 13:30, so we can't go there.\n\nLooking at 14:00-15:00: Arthur is free from 12:30-14:30, and Kelly is free until 14:00. So maybe 14:00-14:30?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nAt 14:00, Arthur is free until 14:30, Kelly is busy starting at 14:00, so that's not good.\n\nWhat about 13:30-14:00? Harold is busy until 13:30, so that might not work.\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe 14:30-15:00? Arthur is busy from 14:30-15:00, so that's out.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see:\n\nHarold is free from 10:30-13:00, but he doesn't want to meet after 13:00.\n\nSo the latest he can meet is 13:00. So the meeting has to end by 13:00.\n\nLooking at the times before 13:00:\n\nFrom 12:30-13:00, Jacqueline is busy, so that's out.\n\nWhat about 11:30-12:00? Let's see:\n\nJacqueline is free from 11:30-12:30.\n\nHarold is free from 10:30-13:00.\n\nArthur is busy from 10:00-12:30, so he's busy until 12:30.\n\nKelly is free from 12:30-14:00.\n\nWait, so at 11:30-12:00, Arthur is still busy until 12:30. So he's not free yet.\n\nSo maybe 12:00-12:30? Let's check:\n\nJacqueline is free until 12:30.\n\nHarold is free until 13:00.\n\nArthur becomes free at 12:30.\n\nKelly is free from 12:30 onwards.\n\nSo at 12:00, Arthur is still busy. So 12:00-12:30 won't work because Arthur is busy until 12:30.\n\nWhat about 12:30-13:00? Jacqueline is busy then, so that's out.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to look earlier.\n\nFrom 10:30-11:00:\n\nJacqueline is free from 9:30-11:00.\n\nHarold is free from 10:30-13:00.\n\nArthur is busy until 12:30.\n\nKelly is free from 11:00-11:30.\n\nWait, so at 10:30-11:00, Arthur is busy, so that's no good.\n\nWhat about 11:00-11:30? Jacqueline is busy then.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing a slot. Let's see:\n\nIs there any 30-minute window where all four are free before 13:00?\n\nLooking at 9:30-10:00: Jacqueline, Arthur, and Kelly are free, but Harold is busy until 10:00.\n\nAt 10:00, Harold is busy until 10:30.\n\nFrom 10:30-11:00: Harold is free, but Arthur is busy until 12:30.\n\nFrom 11:00-11:30: Jacqueline is busy.\n\nFrom 11:30-12:00: Jacqueline is free, Harold is free, Arthur is busy until 12:30, Kelly is free from 12:30.\n\nSo at 11:30-12:00, Arthur is still busy.\n\nFrom 12:00-12:30: Arthur is still busy until 12:30.\n\nAt 12:30-13:00: Jacqueline is busy.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check Arthur's schedule again.\n\nArthur is busy from 10:00-12:30. So he's free from 12:30 onwards.\n\nSo at 12:30-13:00, he's free, but Jacqueline is busy.\n\nSo the only time that seems possible is 14:00-14:30, but Harold can't meet after 13:00.\n\nWait, but Harold's constraint is he doesn't want to meet after 13:00, so the meeting has to end by 13:00.\n\nSo the latest possible start time is 12:30, ending at 13:00.\n\nBut at 12:30-13:00, Jacqueline is busy.\n\nIs there any other time?\n\nWait, what about 13:00-13:30? Harold is busy until 13:30, so that's out.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I need to adjust the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a slot. Let me try again.\n\nLooking at all four schedules:\n\n- Jacqueline: free from 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n\n- Harold: free from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-13:00.\n\n- Arthur: free from 9:30-10:00, 12:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30.\n\n- Kelly: free from 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n\nLooking for overlapping free times:\n\nFrom 9:30-10:00: Jacqueline, Arthur, Kelly are free, but Harold is busy until 10:00.\n\nFrom 10:00-10:30: Harold is busy.\n\nFrom 10:30-11:00: Harold is free, but Arthur is busy.\n\nFrom 11:00-11:30: Jacqueline is busy.\n\nFrom 11:30-12:00: Jacqueline is free, Harold is free, Arthur is busy, Kelly is free.\n\nWait, at 11:30-12:00, Arthur is busy until 12:30, so he's not free.\n\nFrom 12:00-12:30: Arthur is still busy.\n\nAt 12:30-13:00: Arthur is free, but Jacqueline is busy.\n\nSo the only possible time that overlaps for all four is 14:00-14:30, but Harold can't meet after 13:00.\n\nWait, but the user said there's a solution, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the busy times.\n\nLet me list out the busy times again:\n\nJacqueline:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 15:30-16:00\n\nSo her free times are:\n9:30-11:00\n11:30-12:30\n13:00-15:30\n16:00-17:00\n\nHarold:\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 15:00-17:00\n\nBut he doesn't want to meet after 13:00, so his available times are:\n9:00-10:00\n10:30-13:00\n\nArthur:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-12:30\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 15:30-17:00\n\nHis free times:\n9:30-10:00\n12:30-14:30\n15:00-15:30\n\nKelly:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-11:00\n- 11:30-12:30\n- 14:00-15:00\n- 15:30-16:00\n\nHer free times:\n9:30-10:00\n11:00-11:30\n12:30-14:00\n15:00-15:30\n16:00-17:00\n\nNow, looking for a 30-minute slot where all four are free.\n\nLet's check from 12:30 onwards.\n\nAt 12:30-13:00:\n- Jacqueline: busy\n- Harold: free until 13:00\n- Arthur: free\n- Kelly: free\n\nBut Jacqueline is busy, so no.\n\nWhat about 13:00-13:30:\n- Jacqueline: free\n- Harold: busy\n- Arthur: free\n- Kelly: free\n\nBut Harold is busy, so no.\n\nWhat about 14:00-14:30:\n- Jacqueline: free\n- Harold: can't meet after 13:00\n- Arthur: free\n- Kelly: busy until 15:00\n\nSo Kelly is busy, so no.\n\nWait, Kelly is busy from 14:00-15:00, so 14:00-14:30 is busy for her.\n\nWhat about 15:00-15:30:\n- Jacqueline: free\n- Harold: can't meet after 13:00\n- Arthur: free\n- Kelly: free\n\nBut Harold can't meet after 13:00, so that's out.\n\nHmm, I'm not finding a time. Maybe I need to look earlier.\n\nWhat about 11:00-11:30:\n- Jacqueline: busy\n- Harold: free\n- Arthur: busy\n- Kelly: free\n\nNo, Jacqueline and Arthur are busy.\n\nWhat about 10:30-11:00:\n- Jacqueline: free\n- Harold: free\n- Arthur: busy\n- Kelly: busy until 11:00\n\nSo Kelly is busy until 11:00.\n\nWhat about 9:30-10:00:\n- Jacqueline: free\n- Harold: busy until 10:00\n- Arthur: free\n- Kelly: free\n\nBut Harold is busy until 10:00, so 9:30-10:00 is only 30 minutes, but Harold is busy until 10:00.\n\nWait, 9:30-10:00 is 30 minutes, but Harold is busy until 10:00, so he can't make it.\n\nIs there any other time?\n\nWait, what about 12:00-12:30:\n- Jacqueline: free until 12:30\n- Harold: free until 13:00\n- Arthur: busy until 12:30\n- Kelly: free from 12:30\n\nSo at 12:00-12:30, Arthur is busy until 12:30, so he can't make it.\n\nAt 12:30-13:00, Jacqueline is busy.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe the solution is 14:00-14:30, but Harold can't meet after 13:00.\n\nWait, the user said there's a solution, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe Harold's constraint is that he doesn't want to meet after 13:00, but the meeting could end at 13:00.\n\nSo a meeting from 12:30-13:00 would end at 13:00, which is acceptable.\n\nBut Jacqueline is busy then.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the approach.\n\nLet me try to find a time when all four are free.\n\nLooking at the free slots:\n\nThe only overlapping free time seems to be 14:00-14:30, but Harold can't meet then.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the meeting can be scheduled at 13:00-13:30, but Harold is busy until 13:30.\n\nNo, that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe 15:00-15:30, but Harold can't meet after 13:00.\n\nI'm not finding a time. Maybe the solution is to have the meeting at 14:00-14:30, but Harold's constraint is that he doesn't want to meet after 13:00, so perhaps that's acceptable as the meeting ends at 14:30, but he can't attend.\n\nWait, no, the meeting has to be when Harold is available, which is before 13:00.\n\nI'm confused. Maybe I need to look again.\n\nWait, perhaps the meeting is at 12:00-12:30.\n\nAt 12:00-12:30:\n\n- Jacqueline: free\n- Harold: free\n- Arthur: busy until 12:30\n- Kelly: free from 12:30\n\nSo Arthur is busy until 12:30, so he can't make it.\n\nWhat about 11:30-12:00:\n\n- Jacqueline: free\n- Harold: free\n- Arthur: busy\n- Kelly: free\n\nArthur is busy, so no.\n\nWhat about 10:30-11:00:\n\n- Jacqueline: free\n- Harold: free\n- Arthur: busy\n- Kelly: busy until 11:00\n\nSo Kelly is busy until 11:00.\n\nWhat about 9:30-10:00:\n\n- Jacqueline: free\n- Harold: busy until 10:00\n- Arthur: free\n- Kelly: free\n\nBut Harold is busy until 10:00, so he can't make it.\n\nI'm not finding a time. Maybe the solution is 14:00-14:30, but Harold can't attend.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting Harold's constraint.\n\nHarold doesn't want to meet on Monday after 13:00, meaning the meeting can't start after 13:00.\n\nSo the latest start time is 13:00, but the meeting would end at 13:30.\n\nBut at 13:00-13:30, Harold is busy until 13:30.\n\nWait, no, Harold is busy from 13:00-13:30, so he can't attend.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to adjust the code to find the correct time.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct time is 14:00-14:30, but Harold can't attend. So maybe the user made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a slot.\n\nWait, let me try to list all possible 30-minute slots and check each one.\n\nFrom 9:00-9:30: Jacqueline, Arthur, Kelly busy.\n\n9:30-10:00: Jacqueline, Arthur, Kelly free; Harold busy.\n\n10:00-10:30: Harold busy.\n\n10:30-11:00: Harold free; Arthur busy.\n\n11:00-11:30: Jacqueline busy.\n\n11:30-12:00: Jacqueline free; Arthur busy.\n\n12:00-12:30: Arthur busy.\n\n12:30-13:00: Jacqueline busy.\n\n13:00-13:30: Harold busy.\n\n13:30-14:00: Harold busy.\n\n14:00-14:30: Harold can't meet after 13:00.\n\nWait, I'm not finding any time. Maybe the solution is to have the meeting at 14:00-14:30, but Harold can't attend. So perhaps the user's problem has an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the meeting can be at 15:00-15:30, but Harold can't meet after 13:00.\n\nNo, that's not possible.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe the solution is to have the meeting at 14:00-14:30, but Harold can't attend. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a time slot.\n\nWait, perhaps the meeting can be at 12:30-13:00, but Jacqueline is busy.\n\nNo, that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe the meeting can be at 16:00-16:30, but Harold is busy until 17:00.\n\nNo, that's not possible.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities. Maybe the solution is to have the meeting at 14:00-14:30, even though Harold can't attend, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the code. Let me check the code.\n\nWait, the code is supposed to find a time that works for everyone. So maybe the code will find 14:00-14:30, but Harold can't attend. So perhaps the user's problem has an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code will find a different time.\n\nWait, looking at the code, it checks for each day, and for each time slot, it checks if all participants are free.\n\nSo perhaps the code will find 14:00-14:30, but Harold is busy after 13:00, so the code should not select that time.\n\nWait, but in the code, Harold's constraint is that he doesn't want to meet after 13:00 on Monday.\n\nSo in the code, when checking times after 13:00, it should skip them.\n\nSo the code should not select 14:00-14:30 because Harold's constraint is that he can't meet after 13:00.\n\nTherefore, the code should find a time before 13:00.\n\nBut I can't find any time before 13:00 that works for all four.\n\nWait, perhaps the code will find 12:30-13:00, but Jacqueline is busy then.\n\nSo I'm confused. Maybe the solution is to have the meeting at 14:00-14:30, but that doesn't work for Harold.\n\nPerhaps the user made a mistake in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the meeting can be at 15:00-15:30, but Harold can't attend.\n\nNo, that's not possible.\n\nI think I've spent too much time on this. Maybe the answer is 14:00-14:30, but Harold can't attend. So perhaps the user's problem has an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 14:00-14:30, and the code will handle it somehow.\n\nI'll proceed with that.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes since midnight\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00\n\n    # Meeting duration in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n\n    # Participants' busy intervals on Monday\n    jacqueline_busy = [\n        (9*60, 9*60 + 30),     # 9:00-9:30\n        (11*60, 11*60 + 30),    # 11:00-11:30\n        (12*60 + 30, 13*60),    # 12:30-13:00\n        (15*60 + 30, 16*60)     # 15:30-16:00\n    ]\n    harold_busy = [\n        (10*60, 10*60 + 30),   # 10:00-10:30\n        (13*60, 13*60 + 30),    # 13:00-13:30\n        (15*60, 17*60)          # 15:00-17:00\n    ]\n    arthur_busy = [\n        (9*60, 9*60 + 30),      # 9:00-9:30\n        (10*60, 12*60 + 30),     # 10:00-12:30\n        (14*60 + 30, 15*60),     # 14:30-15:00\n        (15*60 + 30, 17*60)      # 15:30-17:00\n    ]\n    kelly_busy = [\n        (9*60, 9*60 + 30),      # 9:00-9:30\n        (10*60, 11*60),          # 10:00-11:00\n        (11*60 + 30, 12*60 + 30), # 11:30-12:30\n        (14*60, 15*60),          # 14:00-15:00\n        (15*60 + 30, 16*60)      # 15:30-16:00\n    ]\n\n    # Constraints\n    harold_constraint = (13*60, work_end)  # Cannot meet after 13:00\n\n    # Function to convert minutes to HH:MM format\n    def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n        return f\"{minutes // 60:02d}:{minutes % 60:02d}\"\n\n    # Function to check if a time slot is free for a person\n    def is_time_free(busy_intervals, start_time, end_time):\n        if end_time > work_end or start_time < work_start:\n            return False\n        for busy_start, busy_end in busy_intervals:\n            if not (end_time <= busy_start or start_time >= busy_end):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Find common free time slots\n    time_slots = []\n    current_time = work_start\n    while current_time + meeting_duration <= work_end:\n        end_time = current_time + meeting_duration\n        # Check Harold's constraint\n        if current_time >= harold_constraint[0]:\n            break\n        # Check if all participants are free\n        if (is_time_free(jacqueline_busy, current_time, end_time) and\n            is_time_free(harold_busy, current_time, end_time) and\n            is_time_free(arthur_busy, current_time, end_time) and\n            is_time_free(kelly_busy, current_time, end_time)):\n            time_slots.append((current_time, end_time))\n        current_time += 30  # Check every 30 minutes\n\n    # If any time slots found, return the first one\n    if time_slots:\n        start, end = time_slots[0]\n        start_time = minutes_to_time(start)\n        end_time = minutes_to_time(end)\n        return f\"{start_time}:{end_time} on Monday\"\n\n    return \"No common time slot found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
