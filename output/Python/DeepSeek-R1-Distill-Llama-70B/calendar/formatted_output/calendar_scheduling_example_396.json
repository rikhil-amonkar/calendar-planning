            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to solve this problem where I have to find a suitable time for a meeting involving several people, considering their busy schedules. The goal is to write a Python script that finds a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the problem statement again to make sure I understand all the constraints. The participants are Andrea, Jack, Madison, Rachel, Douglas, and Ryan. Each has their own busy times on Monday. Andrea's calendar is completely open, which is helpful. The others have various blocked times.\n\nI think the first step is to list out all the busy intervals for each person. Since Andrea is free all day, I don't need to worry about her schedule. For the others, I'll convert their busy times into minutes since midnight to make it easier to handle time calculations.\n\nNext, I need to combine all these busy intervals into a single list. This way, I can sort them and look for gaps where there's a 30-minute window that doesn't overlap with any of the busy times.\n\nI should also make sure to handle the time correctly. The meeting has to be within 9:00 to 17:00, so I'll convert these times into total minutes to avoid dealing with hours and minutes separately.\n\nOnce I have all the busy intervals combined and sorted, I'll iterate through them to find the earliest available slot that can accommodate a 30-minute meeting. I'll start checking from 9:00 onwards. For each busy interval, I'll see if there's a gap before it starts where a meeting can fit. If I find such a gap, I'll return that time. If not, I'll move to the next gap.\n\nIf I don't find any gaps between the busy intervals, I'll check if there's time after the last busy interval ends but before 17:00.\n\nI also need to make sure that the output is in the correct format, showing the start and end times in HH:MM:HH:MM and the day of the week.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code. I'll start by defining the busy intervals for each person. Then, I'll combine them into a single list and sort them based on the start time. After that, I'll iterate through the sorted intervals to find the earliest available slot.\n\nI should also test the code to ensure it handles edge cases correctly, like when the meeting can be scheduled right at the beginning of the day or at the end.\n\nAlright, I think I have a plan. Now, I'll proceed to write the Python script following these steps.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the busy intervals for each participant in minutes since midnight\n    # Format: (start_hour, start_minute, end_hour, end_minute)\n    schedules = {\n        \"Andrea\": [],\n        \"Jack\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (14, 0, 14, 30)],\n        \"Madison\": [(9, 30, 10, 30), (13, 0, 14, 0), (15, 0, 15, 30), (16, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Rachel\": [(9, 30, 10, 30), (11, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 13, 30), (14, 30, 15, 30), (16, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Douglas\": [(9, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 16, 30)],\n        \"Ryan\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (13, 0, 14, 0), (14, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    day = \"Monday\"\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes in minutes\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    all_busy = []\n    for person in schedules:\n        for interval in schedules[person]:\n            start = interval[0] * 60 + interval[1]\n            end = interval[2] * 60 + interval[3]\n            all_busy.append((start, end))\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Check for available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start:\n            # Found a slot\n            meeting_start = current_time\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n        current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n    # Check if there's time after the last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        meeting_start = current_time\n        meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n        return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
