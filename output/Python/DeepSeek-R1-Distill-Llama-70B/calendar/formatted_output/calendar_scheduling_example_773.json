The meeting should last one hour and take place between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Patrick's schedule is completely open, so the only constraints come from Roy's schedule.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Roy's schedule for each day:\n\n- **Monday**: Busy from 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 17:00.\n- **Tuesday**: Busy from 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00.\n- **Wednesday**: Busy from 9:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nSince the group wants to meet as early as possible, I'll start by checking Monday.\n\n**Monday:**\n- The first available slot after 9:00 is between 9:00 and 10:00. Since Patrick is free, this slot works. It's an hour-long slot, which fits the meeting duration.\n\nI don't need to check Tuesday or Wednesday since I've already found an available time on Monday.\n\nSo, the earliest available time is on Monday from 9:00 to 10:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    patrick_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [],\n        'Tuesday': [],\n        'Wednesday': []\n    }\n\n    roy_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(10*60, 11.5*60), (12*60, 13*60), (14*60, 14.5*60), (15*60, 17*60)],\n        'Tuesday': [(10.5*60, 11.5*60), (12*60, 14.5*60), (15*60, 15.5*60), (16*60, 17*60)],\n        'Wednesday': [(9.5*60, 11.5*60), (12.5*60, 14*60), (14.5*60, 15.5*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 60  # 60 minutes\n\n    for day in days:\n        # Get busy intervals for both participants on the current day\n        patrick_busy = patrick_schedule.get(day, [])\n        roy_busy = roy_schedule.get(day, [])\n\n        # Combine and sort all busy intervals\n        all_busy = []\n        for interval in patrick_busy:\n            all_busy.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Patrick'))\n        for interval in roy_busy:\n            all_busy.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Roy'))\n\n        all_busy.sort()\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        current_time = start_time\n        for busy_start, busy_end, person in all_busy:\n            if current_time < busy_start:\n                # Found an available slot\n                if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                    # Format the time\n                    start_h = current_time // 60\n                    start_m = current_time % 60\n                    end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                    end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n                    \n                    # Convert to HH:MM format\n                    start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                    end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n                    \n                    print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                    return\n            current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n        # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            start_h = current_time // 60\n            start_m = current_time % 60\n            end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n            end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n            \n            start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n            end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n            \n            print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n            return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
