            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this meeting scheduling problem. So, we have six people: Christine, Janice, Bobby, Elizabeth, Tyler, and Edward. We need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 that works for everyone. \n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times to see where the overlaps are.\n\n**Christine's Schedule:**\n- 9:30-10:30\n- 12:00-12:30\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 16:00-16:30\n\n**Janice's Schedule:**\n- Wide open all day.\n\n**Bobby's Schedule:**\n- 12:00-12:30\n- 14:30-15:00\n\n**Elizabeth's Schedule:**\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 11:30-13:00\n- 13:30-14:00\n- 15:00-15:30\n- 16:00-17:00\n\n**Tyler's Schedule:**\n- 9:00-11:00\n- 12:00-12:30\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 15:30-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\n**Edward's Schedule:**\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-11:00\n- 11:30-14:00\n- 14:30-15:30\n- 16:00-17:00\n\nNow, considering Janice prefers not to meet after 13:00, we'll focus on times before that.\n\nLet's look for overlapping free slots before 13:00.\n\n- **9:00-9:30:** Elizabeth and Edward are busy.\n- **9:30-10:30:** Christine is busy.\n- **10:30-11:00:** Janice is free, but let's check others:\n  - Christine: Free\n  - Bobby: Free\n  - Elizabeth: Free (her busy time starts at 11:30)\n  - Tyler: Busy until 11:00\n  - Edward: Busy until 11:00\n\nSo, 10:30-11:00 seems possible, but Tyler and Edward are busy until 11:00. So, not everyone is free.\n\n- **11:00-11:30:** Let's check:\n  - Christine: Free\n  - Janice: Free\n  - Bobby: Free\n  - Elizabeth: Busy starts at 11:30, so free until then\n  - Tyler: Busy until 11:00, so free after\n  - Edward: Busy until 11:00, free after\n\nSo, 11:00-11:30 looks promising. Everyone is free except Elizabeth, who is free until 11:30. So, this slot works.\n\nBut wait, Elizabeth's busy time starts at 11:30, so she's available until then. Therefore, 11:00-11:30 is a good slot.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Christine: Free\n- Janice: Free\n- Bobby: Free\n- Elizabeth: Free until 11:30\n- Tyler: Free after 11:00\n- Edward: Free after 11:00\n\nYes, 11:00-11:30 works for everyone.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled at 11:00-11:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    christine_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9.5*60, 10.5*60), (12*60, 12.5*60), \n                   (13*60, 13.5*60), (14.5*60, 15*60), \n                   (16*60, 16.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    janice_schedule = {\n        'Monday': []\n    }\n\n    bobby_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(12*60, 12.5*60), (14.5*60, 15*60)]\n    }\n\n    elizabeth_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 9.5*60), (11.5*60, 13*60), \n                   (13.5*60, 14*60), (15*60, 15.5*60), \n                   (16*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    tyler_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 11*60), (12*60, 12.5*60), \n                   (13*60, 13.5*60), (15.5*60, 16*60), \n                   (16.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    edward_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 9.5*60), (10*60, 11*60), \n                   (11.5*60, 14*60), (14.5*60, 15.5*60), \n                   (16*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    day = 'Monday'\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    busy_intervals = []\n    for interval in christine_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Christine'))\n    for interval in janice_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Janice'))\n    for interval in bobby_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Bobby'))\n    for interval in elizabeth_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Elizabeth'))\n    for interval in tyler_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Tyler'))\n    for interval in edward_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Edward'))\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    busy_intervals.sort()\n\n    # Find available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end, person in busy_intervals:\n        if current_time < busy_start:\n            if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                # Found a suitable time\n                start_h = current_time // 60\n                start_m = current_time % 60\n                end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n                print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                return\n        current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n    # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        start_h = current_time // 60\n        start_m = current_time % 60\n        end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n        end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n        print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n        return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
