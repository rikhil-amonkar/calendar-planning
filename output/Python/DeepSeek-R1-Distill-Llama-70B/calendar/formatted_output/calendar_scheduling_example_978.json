            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help schedule a meeting between Brian and Julia for one hour, and it has to be between 9 AM and 5 PM, from Monday to Friday. Brian doesn't want more meetings on Monday, so I should try to avoid that day if possible. The goal is to find the earliest available time that works for both of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look at their schedules day by day, starting from Tuesday since Brian prefers not to have meetings on Monday. I'll check each day, see their busy times, and find overlapping free slots where both are available for an hour.\n\nStarting with Tuesday:\n\nBrian is busy on Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30. Julia is busy on Tuesday during 13:00 to 14:00 and 16:00 to 16:30. So, on Tuesday, the work hours are from 9 to 17. Let's break it down:\n\n- 9:00 to 9:30: Brian is busy.\n- 9:30 to 13:00: Brian is free. Julia is free from 9:30 to 13:00 except her busy times. Wait, Julia is busy from 13:00 to 14:00, so before that, she's free until 13:00. So from 9:30 to 13:00, both are free except for Julia's 13:00 to 14:00. So the available slot could be from 9:30 to 10:30, but wait, the meeting needs to be an hour long. So from 9:30 to 10:30, both are free? Let me check.\n\nWait, Brian is free from 9:30 onwards on Tuesday. Julia is free from 9:00 to 13:00, except she's busy from 13:00 to 14:00 and 16:00 to 16:30. So from 9:30 to 13:00, both are free. So a meeting could be scheduled from 9:30 to 10:30 on Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm their schedules again to make sure.\n\nBrian's Tuesday schedule: 9:00 to 9:30 busy.\n\nJulia's Tuesday schedule: 13:00 to 14:00 and 16:00 to 16:30 busy.\n\nSo yes, from 9:30 to 13:00, both are free. So a meeting from 9:30 to 10:30 on Tuesday works.\n\nBut wait, the user wants the earliest availability, so maybe there's an earlier slot on another day.\n\nBut since we're prioritizing not having meetings on Monday, and Tuesday seems to have an available slot, that should be the earliest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Wednesday has an earlier slot, but since Tuesday is earlier in the week, it's better.\n\nSo the proposed time would be Tuesday from 9:30 to 10:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the busy intervals for Brian and Julia for each day\n    brian_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 30, 10, 0), (12, 30, 14, 30), (15, 30, 16, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0, 9, 30)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(12, 30, 14, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Thursday\": [(11, 0, 11, 30), (13, 0, 13, 30), (16, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Friday\": [(9, 30, 10, 0), (10, 30, 11, 0), (13, 0, 13, 30), (15, 0, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    julia_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 0, 10, 0), (11, 0, 11, 30), (12, 30, 13, 0), (15, 30, 16, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(13, 0, 14, 0), (16, 0, 16, 30)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Thursday\": [(9, 0, 10, 30), (11, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Friday\": [(9, 0, 10, 0), (10, 30, 11, 30), (12, 30, 14, 0), (14, 30, 15, 0), (15, 30, 16, 0)]\n    }\n\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    # Prioritize days, avoiding Monday if possible\n    priority_days = [\"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Monday\"]\n\n    for day in priority_days:\n        brian_busy = brian_schedule[day]\n        julia_busy = julia_schedule[day]\n\n        # Combine and sort busy intervals\n        combined_busy = sorted(brian_busy + julia_busy, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        current_time = start_time\n        for interval in combined_busy:\n            start, end = interval[0] * 60 + interval[1], interval[2] * 60 + interval[3]\n            if current_time + meeting_duration <= start:\n                # Found a slot\n                meeting_start = current_time\n                meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n                return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n            current_time = max(current_time, end)\n\n        # Check if there's time after the last busy interval\n        if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            meeting_start = current_time\n            meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n            return f\"{meeting_start//60:02d}:{meeting_start%60:02d}:{meeting_end//60:02d}:{meeting_end%60:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
