The meeting should last one hour, and it needs to be between 9:00 and 17:00. Let me look at each person's schedule and see where they're free.\n\nStarting with Stephanie, she's busy from 10:00 to 10:30 and again from 16:00 to 16:30. So her available times are from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 16:00, and after 16:30.\n\nCheryl has meetings at 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. So she's free from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:30.\n\nBradley is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 17:00. His available times are from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 15:30.\n\nSteven has a pretty busy schedule: 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, and 14:30 to 17:00. So he's only free from 12:00 to 13:00 and 13:30 to 14:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a one-hour slot where all four are free. Let's see:\n\n- From 12:00 to 13:00: Steven is free. Let's check the others:\n  - Stephanie is free (until 16:00).\n  - Cheryl is free (until 13:30).\n  - Bradley is free (from 11:30 to 13:30).\n  \nSo, 12:00 to 13:00 looks like a good fit. It's within everyone's available times and doesn't conflict with any of their meetings.\n\nI think that's the earliest and most convenient time for everyone.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each person as a dictionary with days and busy intervals\n    stephanie_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(10*60, 10.5*60), (16*60, 16.5*60)]\n    }\n\n    cheryl_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(10*60, 10.5*60), (11.5*60, 12*60), \n                   (13.5*60, 14*60), (16.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    bradley_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9.5*60, 10*60), (10.5*60, 11.5*60), \n                   (13.5*60, 14*60), (14.5*60, 15*60), \n                   (15.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    steven_schedule = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 12*60), (13*60, 13.5*60), (14.5*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    day = 'Monday'\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 60  # 60 minutes\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    busy_intervals = []\n    for interval in stephanie_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Stephanie'))\n    for interval in cheryl_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Cheryl'))\n    for interval in bradley_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Bradley'))\n    for interval in steven_schedule[day]:\n        busy_intervals.append((interval[0], interval[1], 'Steven'))\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    busy_intervals.sort()\n\n    # Find available slots\n    current_time = start_time\n    for busy_start, busy_end, person in busy_intervals:\n        if current_time < busy_start:\n            if busy_start - current_time >= meeting_duration:\n                # Found a suitable time\n                start_h = current_time // 60\n                start_m = current_time % 60\n                end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n                end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n                end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n                print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n                return\n        current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n    # Check if there's remaining time after last busy interval\n    if current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n        start_h = current_time // 60\n        start_m = current_time % 60\n        end_h = (current_time + meeting_duration) // 60\n        end_m = (current_time + meeting_duration) % 60\n\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d}\"\n\n        print(f\"Meeting scheduled on {day} from {start_time_str} to {end_time_str}\")\n        return\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
