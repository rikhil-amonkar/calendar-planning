            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to schedule a meeting for Betty and Megan. The meeting needs to be one hour long, and it has to be on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday between 9:00 and 17:00. \n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints. Betty can't meet on Wednesday and Thursday. That leaves us with Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. But wait, looking at Megan's schedule, she's blocked the entire day on Monday and Friday. So, that means the only possible day left is Tuesday. That's a crucial point because it narrows down our options significantly.\n\nNow, let's look at both Betty's and Megan's schedules for Tuesday. Betty is busy during several time slots: 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. Megan, on the other hand, has blocks on Tuesday from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nOur goal is to find a one-hour slot on Tuesday where both Betty and Megan are free. Let's map out the available times.\n\nStarting from 9:00, Megan is busy until 9:30. Betty is free from 9:00 to 9:30, but since Megan isn't available until 9:30, that slot is out.\n\nNext, from 9:30 to 10:00, Betty is busy. So, that's not an option.\n\nFrom 10:00 to 10:30, Megan is busy again, so that's ruled out.\n\nBetween 10:30 and 11:00, Betty is busy, so no go there either.\n\nFrom 11:00 to 12:00, Betty is free. Let's check Megan's availability. Megan is free from 10:30 to 12:00. So, from 11:00 to 12:00, both are free. That's a potential slot, but we need a full hour. If we start at 11:00, the meeting would end at 12:00, which fits perfectly.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Betty's next busy slot starts at 12:00, so she's free until then. Megan is busy starting at 12:00, so she's free until 12:00 as well. Therefore, 11:00 to 12:00 is a valid option.\n\nHowever, let's explore further to ensure there are no better options. After 12:00, Betty is busy until 12:30, and Megan is busy until 14:00. So, the next possible slot would be after 14:00.\n\nFrom 14:00 to 15:00, Betty is busy until 15:00. Megan is free from 14:00 to 15:00, but Betty isn't available until 15:00. So, that doesn't work.\n\nFrom 15:00 to 16:00, Betty is free, but Megan is busy until 15:30 and then again from 16:00 to 16:30. So, the slot from 15:30 to 16:30 is partially blocked by Megan's schedule.\n\nFrom 16:30 to 17:00, Betty is busy, so that's not an option.\n\nTherefore, the only viable time slot on Tuesday where both Betty and Megan are free for an hour is from 11:00 to 12:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours and meeting duration\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9 * 60,  # Convert hours to minutes\n        \"end\": 17 * 60\n    }\n    duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    # Participants' schedules\n    schedules = {\n        \"Betty\": {\n            \"Monday\": [[10*60, 10*60+30], [11*60+30, 12*60+30], [16*60, 16*60+30]],\n            \"Tuesday\": [[9*60+30, 10*60], [10*60+30, 11*60], [12*60, 12*60+30], [13*60+30, 15*60], [16*60+30, 17*60]],\n            \"Wednesday\": [[13*60+30, 14*60], [14*60+30, 15*60]],\n            \"Friday\": [[9*60, 10*60], [11*60+30, 12*60], [12*60+30, 13*60], [14*60+30, 15*60]]\n        },\n        \"Megan\": {\n            \"Monday\": [[9*60, 17*60]],\n            \"Tuesday\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [10*60, 10*60+30], [12*60, 14*60], [15*60, 15*60+30], [16*60, 16*60+30]],\n            \"Wednesday\": [[9*60+30, 10*60+30], [11*60, 11*60+30], [12*60+30, 13*60], [13*60+30, 14*60+30], [15*60+30, 17*60]],\n            \"Thursday\": [[9*60, 10*60+30], [11*60+30, 14*60], [14*60+30, 15*60], [15*60+30, 16*60+30]],\n            \"Friday\": [[9*60, 17*60]]\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Days to check (Betty cannot meet on Wednesday and Thursday)\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Friday\"]\n\n    # Iterate through each day\n    for day in days:\n        # Skip Wednesday and Thursday for Betty\n        if day in [\"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\"]:\n            continue\n\n        # Get busy intervals for the current day\n        betty_busy = schedules[\"Betty\"].get(day, [])\n        megan_busy = schedules[\"Megan\"].get(day, [])\n\n        # Combine busy intervals\n        all_busy = betty_busy + megan_busy\n\n        # Sort busy intervals by start time\n        all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n        # Check for available slots\n        previous_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n        for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n            if busy_start > previous_end:\n                # Found a free slot\n                start_time = previous_end\n                end_time = start_time + duration\n                if end_time <= work_hours[\"end\"]:\n                    # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n                    start_hour = start_time // 60\n                    start_minute = start_time % 60\n                    end_hour = end_time // 60\n                    end_minute = end_time % 60\n\n                    return f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on {day}\"\n            previous_end = max(previous_end, busy_end)\n\n        # Check the last slot after all busy intervals\n        if previous_end + duration <= work_hours[\"end\"]:\n            start_time = previous_end\n            end_time = start_time + duration\n            start_hour = start_time // 60\n            start_minute = start_time % 60\n            end_hour = end_time // 60\n            end_minute = end_time % 60\n\n            return f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per the problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
