            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out a time for a meeting that works for all these people: Joan, Megan, Austin, Betty, Judith, Terry, and Kathryn. The meeting is on Monday and it's half an hour long, between 9 AM and 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times to see where the gaps are. Let's go through each person one by one.\n\nJoan has meetings at 11:30-12:00 and 14:30-15:00. So her free times are 9:00-11:30, 12:00-14:30, and 15:00-17:00.\n\nMegan is busy from 9:00-10:00, 14:00-14:30, and 16:00-16:30. So her free slots are 10:00-14:00, 14:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nAustin is free all day, so he's available anytime.\n\nBetty's busy times are 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:30-14:00, and 16:00-16:30. Her free times are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30, 12:00-13:30, 14:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nJudith has blocks from 9:00-11:00, 12:00-13:00, and 14:00-15:00. So she's free between 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, and 15:00-17:00.\n\nTerry is busy during 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-14:00, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-17:00. His free times are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-15:00, and 15:30-16:00.\n\nKathryn has meetings at 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-13:00, 14:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. So she's free from 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 13:00-14:00, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot where all of them are free. Let's look for overlapping free times.\n\nLooking at everyone's schedules, let's check each possible time slot:\n\n- 9:00-9:30: Joan, Megan (until 10), Austin, Betty (until 9:30), Judith (busy until 11), Terry (free until 9:30), Kathryn (free until 9:30). But Judith is busy until 11, so this slot doesn't work.\n\n- 10:00-10:30: Joan is free, Megan is free until 14, Austin is free, Betty is free until 11:30, Judith is busy until 11, so Judith is free at 11, so 10:00-10:30 is too early for Judith. So this slot is out.\n\n- 11:00-11:30: Joan is free until 11:30, Megan is free, Austin is free, Betty is free until 11:30, Judith is free from 11-12, Terry is free until 11:30, Kathryn is free from 11-11:30. So from 11:00-11:30, everyone except Joan, who is busy at 11:30. Wait, Joan is busy starting at 11:30, so until 11:30 she's free. So 11:00-11:30 might work. But let's check each person:\n\nJoan: free until 11:30, so 11:00-11:30 is okay.\n\nMegan: free from 10-14, so yes.\n\nAustin: yes.\n\nBetty: free until 11:30, yes.\n\nJudith: free from 11-12, yes.\n\nTerry: free until 11:30, yes.\n\nKathryn: free from 11-11:30, yes.\n\nSo 11:00-11:30 seems to work for everyone. Wait, but let me double-check. Does anyone have a conflict at 11:00?\n\nLooking again:\n\nJoan: free until 11:30, so yes.\n\nMegan: yes.\n\nBetty: yes.\n\nJudith: yes.\n\nTerry: yes.\n\nKathryn: yes.\n\nSo that slot is available. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other constraints. The meeting is 30 minutes, so 11:00-11:30 fits.\n\nAlternatively, let's check other possible slots to confirm.\n\nAnother possible slot could be 15:00-15:30. Let's see:\n\nJoan: free from 15:00 onwards.\n\nMegan: free until 16:00, so yes.\n\nAustin: yes.\n\nBetty: free from 14:00-16:00, so yes.\n\nJudith: free from 15:00 onwards.\n\nTerry: free from 15:30-16:00, but 15:00-15:30 Terry is busy until 15:30? Wait, Terry is busy from 15:00-15:30, so he's busy during that time. So 15:00-15:30 wouldn't work for Terry.\n\nSo the only slot that works is 11:00-11:30. Let me make sure no one is busy then.\n\nYes, as checked earlier, everyone is free at that time. So the proposed time is Monday, 11:00 to 11:30.\n</think>\n\n'''python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each participant as dictionaries with their busy intervals\n    schedules = {\n        'Joan': [(11*60 + 30, 12*60), (14*60 + 30, 15*60)],\n        'Megan': [(9*60, 10*60), (14*60, 14*60 + 30), (16*60, 16*60 + 30)],\n        'Austin': [],\n        'Betty': [(9*60 + 30, 10*60), (11*60 + 30, 12*60), (13*60 + 30, 14*60), (16*60, 16*60 + 30)],\n        'Judith': [(9*60, 11*60), (12*60, 13*60), (14*60, 15*60)],\n        'Terry': [(9*60 + 30, 10*60), (11*60 + 30, 12*60 + 30), (13*60, 14*60), (15*60, 15*60 + 30), (16*60, 17*60)],\n        'Kathryn': [(9*60 + 30, 10*60), (10*60 + 30, 11*60), (11*60 + 30, 13*60), (14*60, 16*60), (16*60 + 30, 17*60)]\n    }\n\n    # Convert time ranges to minutes since midnight for easier comparison\n    def time_to_minutes(time):\n        return time[0] * 60 + time[1]\n\n    # Generate all possible 30-minute time slots between 9:00 and 17:00\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    time_slots = []\n    for t in range(start_time, end_time - 30, 30):\n        time_slots.append((t, t + 30))\n\n    # Check each time slot against all participants' schedules\n    for slot in time_slots:\n        start, end = slot\n        all_available = True\n        for name, busy_times in schedules.items():\n            for busy_start, busy_end in busy_times:\n                # Check if the current time slot overlaps with any busy time\n                if not (end <= busy_start or start >= busy_end):\n                    all_available = False\n                    break\n            if not all_available:\n                break\n        if all_available:\n            # Convert the time slot back to HH:MM format\n            hours_start = start // 60\n            minutes_start = start % 60\n            hours_end = end // 60\n            minutes_end = end % 60\n            return f\"{hours_start:02d}:{minutes_start:02d}:{hours_end:02d}:{minutes_end:02d}\"\n    \n    # If no time slot found (though the problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No available time slot found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(f\"The proposed meeting time is {meeting_time} on Monday.\")\n'''",
