Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints. The meeting needs to be half an hour long, between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nLooking at Amanda's schedule:\n- On Monday, she's busy from 9:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, and 16:00-16:30. So her free slots on Monday are 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n- On Tuesday, she's busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:30-14:30, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. Her free slots are 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-13:30, 14:30-15:30, and 16:00-16:30. But she doesn't want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00, so her available times on Tuesday are limited to before 11:00.\n\nNathan's schedule:\n- On Monday, he's busy from 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 13:30-14:30, and 16:00-16:30. So his free slots on Monday are 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-13:30, 14:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n- On Tuesday, he's busy from 9:00-10:30, 11:00-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, and 16:00-16:30. His free slots on Tuesday are 10:30-11:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. But Nathan can't meet on Monday, so we can only consider Tuesday for him.\n\nWait, but the meeting has to be on either Monday or Tuesday. Since Nathan can't meet on Monday, the meeting must be on Tuesday. But Amanda doesn't want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00, so we need to find a time on Tuesday before 11:00 that works for both.\n\nLet me list the available slots for both on Tuesday before 11:00.\n\nAmanda's available times on Tuesday before 11:00:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:30-11:30 (but she doesn't want to meet after 11:00, so up to 11:00)\n\nNathan's available times on Tuesday before 11:00:\n- 10:30-11:00 (since he's busy until 10:30 and then free until 11:00)\n\nSo the overlapping time when both are available is 10:30-11:00. That's a 30-minute slot, which fits the meeting duration.\n\nTherefore, the meeting can be scheduled on Tuesday from 10:30 to 11:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes since midnight\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00\n\n    # Meeting duration in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n\n    # Amanda's busy intervals on Monday and Tuesday\n    amanda_busy = {\n        'Monday': [(9*60, 10*60 + 30),  # 9:00-10:30\n                   (11*60, 11*60 + 30),  # 11:00-11:30\n                   (12*60 + 30, 13*60),  # 12:30-13:00\n                   (13*60 + 30, 14*60),  # 13:30-14:00\n                   (14*60 + 30, 15*60),  # 14:30-15:00\n                   (16*60, 16*60 + 30)], # 16:00-16:30\n        'Tuesday': [(9*60, 9*60 + 30),    # 9:00-9:30\n                    (10*60, 10*60 + 30),  # 10:00-10:30\n                    (11*60 + 30, 12*60),  # 11:30-12:00\n                    (13*60 + 30, 14*60 + 30), # 13:30-14:30\n                    (15*60 + 30, 16*60),  # 15:30-16:00\n                    (16*60 + 30, 17*60)]  # 16:30-17:00\n    }\n\n    # Nathan's busy intervals on Monday and Tuesday\n    nathan_busy = {\n        'Monday': [(10*60, 10*60 + 30), # 10:00-10:30\n                   (11*60, 11*60 + 30),  # 11:00-11:30\n                   (13*60 + 30, 14*60 + 30), # 13:30-14:30\n                   (16*60, 16*60 + 30)], # 16:00-16:30\n        'Tuesday': [(9*60, 10*60 + 30),   # 9:00-10:30\n                    (11*60, 13*60),       # 11:00-13:00\n                    (13*60 + 30, 14*60),  # 13:30-14:00\n                    (14*60 + 30, 15*60 + 30), # 14:30-15:30\n                    (16*60, 16*60 + 30)]  # 16:00-16:30\n    }\n\n    # Amanda's constraints\n    amanda_constraints = {\n        'Tuesday': ('max_time', 11 * 60)  # Can't meet after 11:00 on Tuesday\n    }\n\n    # Nathan's constraints\n    nathan_constraints = {\n        'Monday': ('cannot_meet',)  # Can't meet on Monday\n    }\n\n    # Function to convert minutes to HH:MM format\n    def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n        return f\"{minutes // 60:02d}:{minutes % 60:02d}\"\n\n    # Function to check if a time slot is free for a person\n    def is_time_free(person_busy, day, start_time, end_time):\n        if end_time > work_end or start_time < work_start:\n            return False\n        for busy_start, busy_end in person_busy.get(day, []):\n            if not (end_time <= busy_start or start_time >= busy_end):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Find common free time slots\n    for day in ['Monday', 'Tuesday']:\n        # Skip days where Nathan cannot meet\n        if day in nathan_constraints.get('cannot_meet', []):\n            continue\n\n        # Generate all possible time slots for the day\n        time_slots = []\n        current_time = work_start\n        while current_time + meeting_duration <= work_end:\n            end_time = current_time + meeting_duration\n            # Check Amanda's constraints\n            if day == 'Tuesday' and current_time > amanda_constraints['Tuesday'][1]:\n                break\n            # Check if both are free\n            if (is_time_free(amanda_busy, day, current_time, end_time) and\n                is_time_free(nathan_busy, day, current_time, end_time)):\n                time_slots.append((current_time, end_time))\n            current_time += 30  # Check every 30 minutes\n\n        # If any time slots found, return the first one\n        if time_slots:\n            start, end = time_slots[0]\n            start_time = minutes_to_time(start)\n            end_time = minutes_to_time(end)\n            return f\"{start_time}:{end_time} on {day}\"\n\n    return \"No common time slot found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
