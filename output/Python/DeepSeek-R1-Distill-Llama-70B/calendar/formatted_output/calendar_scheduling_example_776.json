            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to help the user by finding a suitable time for a meeting between John and Jennifer. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe meeting should be half an hour long and take place between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. John has no meetings all week, but Jennifer has a lot. Also, John wants to avoid meetings on Monday after 14:30.\n\nFirst, I'll list Jennifer's schedule for each day:\n\nMonday:\n- 9:00-11:00\n- 11:30-13:00\n- 13:30-14:30\n- 15:00-17:00\n\nTuesday:\n- 9:00-11:30\n- 12:00-17:00\n\nWednesday:\n- 9:00-11:30\n- 12:00-12:30\n- 13:00-14:00\n- 14:30-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nNow, I need to find free slots for Jennifer on each day where a 30-minute meeting can fit. Then, check if John is available and if it meets his constraints.\n\nStarting with Monday. Jennifer's free times are:\n- 11:00-11:30 (30 minutes)\n- 14:30-15:00 (30 minutes)\n\nBut John wants to avoid Monday after 14:30, so the 14:30 slot is out. The 11:00-11:30 slot is available. So Monday at 11:00 could work.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other days with better options. Maybe the user prefers earlier days or other times.\n\nLooking at Tuesday. Jennifer's free time is between 11:30 and 12:00. That's only 30 minutes, so exactly fits the meeting. So Tuesday at 11:30-12:00 is an option.\n\nWednesday: The free slots are 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 16:00-16:30. Each 30 minutes. So Wednesday has multiple options.\n\nNow, considering John's preference to avoid Monday after 14:30, but Monday at 11:00 is before that, so it's acceptable. But perhaps the user wants the earliest possible day, which would be Monday. Alternatively, maybe they prefer Tuesday or Wednesday for other reasons.\n\nBut the task is to find a suitable time, not necessarily the earliest. So I can choose any of these options.\n\nLooking at the example solution, it chose Tuesday at 11:30. Maybe because it's the earliest possible on Tuesday, which is the next day after Monday.\n\nSo, I'll structure the code to check each day in order, find the first available slot that fits all constraints.\n\nIn the code, I'll represent each day's schedule as a list of tuples. Then, for each day, check the free slots and see if a 30-minute window is available.\n\nI'll also need to handle the time conversions, maybe using minutes since midnight to make it easier.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n1. Define the days and their schedules.\n2. For each day in order (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), check if there's a 30-minute slot where Jennifer is free, John is available (which he is except after 14:30 on Monday), and within work hours.\n3. Once a slot is found, format the output as required.\n\nI think that's the approach. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each participant\n    jennifer_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 0, 11, 0), (11, 30, 13, 0), (13, 30, 14, 30), (15, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(9, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 17, 0)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 14, 0), (14, 30, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    # Convert time ranges to minutes since midnight for easier calculations\n    def time_to_minutes(hours, minutes):\n        return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n    # Check each day in order of preference\n    for day in [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]:\n        schedule = jennifer_schedule[day]\n        # Sort the schedule by start time\n        schedule.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n        \n        # Check for available slots before the first meeting\n        if schedule[0][0] > 9:\n            start_time = (9, 0)\n            end_time = (9, 30)\n            if time_to_minutes(end_time[0], end_time[1]) <= time_to_minutes(schedule[0][0], schedule[0][1]):\n                return f\"{day}: {start_time[0]:02d}:{start_time[1]:02d}-{end_time[0]:02d}:{end_time[1]:02d}\"\n        \n        # Check for gaps between meetings\n        for i in range(len(schedule) - 1):\n            current_end = schedule[i][2], schedule[i][3]\n            next_start = schedule[i+1][0], schedule[i+1][1]\n            \n            gap_start = current_end\n            gap_end = next_start\n            \n            if gap_end[0] == gap_start[0] and gap_end[1] == gap_start[1]:\n                continue  # No gap\n            \n            # Calculate the duration of the gap\n            gap_duration = (gap_end[0] - gap_start[0]) * 60 + (gap_end[1] - gap_start[1])\n            \n            if gap_duration >= 30:\n                # Check if the gap is within working hours\n                if gap_start[0] >= 9 and gap_end[0] <= 17:\n                    # Check John's preference for Monday\n                    if day == \"Monday\" and gap_start[0] >= 14:  # After 14:30\n                        continue  # Skip this gap\n                    return f\"{day}: {gap_start[0]:02d}:{gap_start[1]:02d}-{gap_start[0]:02d}:{gap_start[1]+30:02d}\"\n        \n        # Check for available slots after the last meeting\n        last_end = schedule[-1][2], schedule[-1][3]\n        if last_end[0] < 17:\n            start_time = last_end\n            end_time = (start_time[0], start_time[1] + 30)\n            if end_time[0] > 17:\n                end_time = (17, 0)\n            if end_time[0] == start_time[0] and end_time[1] < start_time[1]:\n                continue  # Not enough time\n            if day == \"Monday\" and start_time[0] >= 14:  # After 14:30\n                continue  # Skip this slot\n            return f\"{day}: {start_time[0]:02d}:{start_time[1]:02d}-{end_time[0]:02d}:{end_time[1]:02d}\"\n\n    # Default case (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
