The meeting needs to be half an hour long, and it has to be scheduled between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. \n\nFirst, I need to look at everyone's schedules to see when they're busy. Let me list out their availability:\n\n- **Megan** is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, and 12:00 to 12:30.\n- **Christine** has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, and 15:30 to 16:30.\n- **Gabriel** is free all day, so he's available anytime.\n- **Sara** is busy from 11:30 to 12:00 and 14:30 to 15:00.\n- **Bruce** has meetings from 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 16:30.\n- **Kathryn** is busy from 10:00 to 15:30 and 16:00 to 16:30.\n- **Billy** has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 15:30.\n\nOkay, so Gabriel is the easiest since he's free all day. The challenge is finding a 30-minute slot where the other six are all free.\n\nLet me try to visualize the timeline from 9:00 to 17:00 and mark everyone's busy times.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n\n- **9:00 to 9:30**: Megan, Christine, and Billy are busy.\n- **9:30 to 10:00**: Bruce is busy.\n- **10:00 to 11:00**: Megan is busy.\n- **10:30 to 12:00**: Bruce is busy.\n- **11:00 to 11:30**: Billy is busy.\n- **11:30 to 12:00**: Christine and Sara are busy.\n- **12:00 to 12:30**: Megan is busy.\n- **12:30 to 14:00**: Bruce is busy.\n- **13:00 to 14:00**: Christine is busy.\n- **14:00 to 14:30**: Seems like a potential window.\n- **14:30 to 15:00**: Sara and Bruce are busy.\n- **15:00 to 15:30**: Billy is busy.\n- **15:30 to 16:30**: Christine and Bruce are busy.\n- **16:00 to 16:30**: Kathryn is busy.\n\nLooking at this, the only time slot that isn't blocked by anyone's meetings is from 14:00 to 14:30. Let me double-check:\n\n- **Megan**: Free after 12:30, so 14:00 is okay.\n- **Christine**: Her last meeting ends at 14:00, so she's free at 14:00.\n- **Gabriel**: Always free.\n- **Sara**: Her last meeting ends at 15:00, so 14:00 is okay.\n- **Bruce**: His meetings end at 14:00, so he's free at 14:00.\n- **Kathryn**: Busy until 15:30, but 14:00 is before that.\n- **Billy**: His last meeting ends at 15:30, so 14:00 is okay.\n\nYes, 14:00 to 14:30 seems to work for everyone. I think that's the slot to go with.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Define the work hours and meeting duration\nwork_start = \"09:00\"\nwork_end = \"17:00\"\nmeeting_duration = 30  # in minutes\n\n# Define participants' schedules\nparticipants = {\n    \"Megan\": [(\"09:00\", \"09:30\"), (\"10:00\", \"11:00\"), (\"12:00\", \"12:30\")],\n    \"Christine\": [(\"09:00\", \"09:30\"), (\"11:30\", \"12:00\"), (\"13:00\", \"14:00\"), (\"15:30\", \"16:30\")],\n    \"Gabriel\": [],\n    \"Sara\": [(\"11:30\", \"12:00\"), (\"14:30\", \"15:00\")],\n    \"Bruce\": [(\"09:30\", \"10:00\"), (\"10:30\", \"12:00\"), (\"12:30\", \"14:00\"), (\"14:30\", \"15:00\"), (\"15:30\", \"16:30\")],\n    \"Kathryn\": [(\"10:00\", \"15:30\"), (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")],\n    \"Billy\": [(\"09:00\", \"09:30\"), (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"), (\"12:00\", \"14:00\"), (\"14:30\", \"15:30\")]\n}\n\n# Convert time strings to minutes since midnight for easier calculations\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n# Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    minutes = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n# Find the earliest available time slot that fits all constraints\nwork_start_minutes = time_to_minutes(work_start)\nwork_end_minutes = time_to_minutes(work_end)\nmeeting_end_minutes = work_start_minutes + meeting_duration\n\n# Initialize available time as the entire work day\navailable_start = work_start_minutes\navailable_end = work_end_minutes\n\n# Iterate through each participant's schedule to find common free time\nfor name, schedule in participants.items():\n    # Sort the schedule by start time\n    sorted_schedule = sorted(schedule, key=lambda x: time_to_minutes(x[0]))\n    \n    # Initialize with the work start time\n    current_start = work_start_minutes\n    \n    for slot in sorted_schedule:\n        slot_start = time_to_minutes(slot[0])\n        slot_end = time_to_minutes(slot[1])\n        \n        # If the slot starts after the current available start, update the available start\n        if slot_start > current_start:\n            current_start = max(current_start, slot_end)\n    \n    # Update the overall available time\n    available_start = max(available_start, current_start)\n\n# Ensure the meeting time is within work hours\nif available_start + meeting_duration > work_end_minutes:\n    print(\"No available time slot found within constraints.\")\nelse:\n    meeting_start = available_start\n    meeting_end = meeting_start + meeting_duration\n    print(f\"Proposed meeting time: {minutes_to_time(meeting_start)}:{minutes_to_time(meeting_end)} on Monday\")\n```",
