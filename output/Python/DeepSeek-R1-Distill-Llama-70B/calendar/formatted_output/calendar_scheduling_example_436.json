The meeting should be half an hour long and take place on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. \n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's schedules to see where the free slots are. \n\nPatrick is busy from 13:30 to 14:00 and 14:30 to 15:00. So he's free before 13:30, between 14:00 and 14:30, and after 15:00.\n\nShirley has meetings at 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 14:30-15:00, and 16:00-17:00. So her free times are between 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-14:30, and 15:00-16:00.\n\nJeffrey is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, and 16:00-17:00. His free slots are 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-16:00.\n\nGloria is busy from 11:30-12:00 and 15:00-15:30. So she's free otherwise.\n\nNathan is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, and 14:00-17:00. His free times are 9:30-10:30, 12:00-14:00.\n\nAngela has meetings from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 12:30-15:00, and 15:30-16:30. She's free between 9:30-10:00, 11:00-12:30, 15:00-15:30, and after 16:30.\n\nDavid is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-14:00, and 14:30-16:30. His free slots are 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 14:00-14:30, and after 16:30.\n\nNow, I'll look for overlapping free times in all schedules. \n\nLooking at the morning, from 9:30 to 10:00, only Patrick, Gloria, and maybe some others are free, but not everyone. \n\nBetween 10:00-10:30, Patrick is free, but David is busy until 10:30. So that's not a common free time.\n\nFrom 10:30-11:00, Jeffrey and David are free, but Shirley and Nathan have meetings. So that's not suitable.\n\nBetween 11:00-11:30, Shirley is busy, so that's out.\n\nFrom 11:30-12:00, Gloria is busy, so that's not an option.\n\nAt 12:00-12:30, Shirley is busy, so that's out.\n\nBetween 12:30-13:00, most people are free except Patrick, who is busy starting at 13:30.\n\nFrom 13:00-13:30, Jeffrey is busy, so that's not possible.\n\nBetween 13:30-14:00, Patrick is busy, so that's out.\n\nFrom 14:00-14:30, Nathan is busy, so that's not an option.\n\nAt 14:30-15:00, both Patrick and Shirley are busy, so that's out.\n\nBetween 15:00-15:30, Gloria is busy, so that's not possible.\n\nFrom 15:30-16:00, Patrick is free, but others like David are busy until 16:30.\n\nAfter 16:00, Shirley and Jeffrey are busy until 17:00, so that's out.\n\nWait, I think I missed a slot. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, from 12:30-13:00, Patrick is free, Shirley is free, Jeffrey is free, Gloria is free, Nathan is free until 14:00, Angela is free until 12:30, and David is free until 14:00. So from 12:30-13:00, everyone except maybe Angela (who is busy until 12:30) is free. So 12:30-13:00 seems like a common free slot.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm:\n\n- Patrick: Free before 13:30, so 12:30-13:00 is good.\n- Shirley: Free between 12:30-14:30, so yes.\n- Jeffrey: Free between 12:00-13:00, so yes.\n- Gloria: Free, except her busy times don't conflict here.\n- Nathan: Free until 14:00, so yes.\n- Angela: She is busy until 12:30, so she's free starting at 12:30.\n- David: Free until 14:00, so yes.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is a common free slot for everyone. That should be the time for the meeting.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9,\n        \"end\": 17\n    }\n\n    # Define participants' schedules\n    patrick_schedule = [[13.5, 14], [14.5, 15]]\n    shirley_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [11, 11.5], [12, 12.5], [14.5, 15], [16, 17]]\n    jeffrey_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [10.5, 11], [11.5, 12], [13, 13.5], [16, 17]]\n    gloria_schedule = [[11.5, 12], [15, 15.5]]\n    nathan_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [10.5, 12], [14, 17]]\n    angela_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [10, 11], [12.5, 15], [15.5, 16.5]]\n    david_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [10, 10.5], [11, 14], [14.5, 16.5]]\n\n    # Combine all schedules\n    all_schedules = [\n        patrick_schedule,\n        shirley_schedule,\n        jeffrey_schedule,\n        gloria_schedule,\n        nathan_schedule,\n        angela_schedule,\n        david_schedule\n    ]\n\n    # Flatten and sort all busy intervals\n    all_busy = []\n    for schedule in all_schedules:\n        all_busy.extend(schedule)\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Initialize previous end time to work hours start\n    prev_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n\n    # Iterate through each busy interval\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        # Check for available slot before the busy interval starts\n        if busy_start - prev_end >= 0.5:  # 0.5 hours = 30 minutes\n            # Format the time slots\n            start_time = prev_end\n            end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n            # Convert to HH:MM format\n            start_hh = int(start_time)\n            start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n            end_hh = int(end_time)\n            end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n            # Return the earliest available time\n            return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n        \n        # Update previous end time\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, busy_end)\n\n    # Check for available slot after the last busy interval\n    if work_hours[\"end\"] - prev_end >= 0.5:\n        start_time = prev_end\n        end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n        start_hh = int(start_time)\n        start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n        end_hh = int(end_time)\n        end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n        return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
