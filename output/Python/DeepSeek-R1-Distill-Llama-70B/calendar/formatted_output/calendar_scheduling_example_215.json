The meeting should be half an hour long, and it has to be within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00. The group wants to meet at their earliest availability, so I need to find the first available time slot that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each person's schedule to see when they're busy.\n\nSteven is free the entire day, so he's available anytime. Roy also has a completely open calendar, so he's available all day too. That\u2019s helpful because it means I only need to focus on the schedules of Cynthia, Lauren, and Robert.\n\nCynthia is busy during:\n- 9:30 to 10:30\n- 11:30 to 12:00\n- 13:00 to 13:30\n- 15:00 to 16:00\n\nLauren has meetings at:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 10:30 to 11:00\n- 11:30 to 12:00\n- 13:00 to 13:30\n- 14:00 to 14:30\n- 15:00 to 15:30\n- 16:00 to 17:00\n\nRobert is busy during:\n- 10:30 to 11:00\n- 11:30 to 12:00\n- 12:30 to 13:30\n- 14:00 to 16:00\n\nNow, I'll list out all the busy intervals for Cynthia, Lauren, and Robert, and combine them into one list. Then, I'll sort them by start time to see the overall busy periods.\n\nCombined busy intervals:\n- 9:00 to 9:30 (Lauren)\n- 9:30 to 10:30 (Cynthia)\n- 10:30 to 11:00 (Lauren, Robert)\n- 11:30 to 12:00 (Cynthia, Lauren, Robert)\n- 13:00 to 13:30 (Cynthia, Lauren)\n- 14:00 to 14:30 (Lauren)\n- 15:00 to 15:30 (Lauren)\n- 15:00 to 16:00 (Cynthia)\n- 16:00 to 17:00 (Lauren)\n\nNext, I'll look for gaps between these busy intervals where there's at least 30 minutes available.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n- From 9:00 to 9:30, Lauren is busy. So, the next available time after 9:30 would be after Lauren and Cynthia are free.\n\nAfter 10:30 to 11:00, there's a gap from 11:00 to 11:30. That's 30 minutes, which fits our meeting duration. But I need to check if everyone is available during this time.\n\nLooking at the individual schedules:\n- Steven and Roy are free.\n- Cynthia is free between 10:30 and 11:30, except for her busy time from 11:30 to 12:00.\n- Lauren is free between 11:00 and 11:30.\n- Robert is free between 11:00 and 11:30.\n\nSo, from 11:00 to 11:30, everyone except Cynthia is available. But Cynthia is busy starting at 11:30, so the meeting would need to end by 11:30. That means the meeting could be scheduled from 11:00 to 11:30.\n\nWait, but the group wants the earliest availability. Is there an earlier slot?\n\nLooking back, from 9:30 to 10:30, Cynthia is busy. From 10:30 to 11:00, Lauren and Robert are busy. So the next available slot is indeed at 11:00.\n\nTherefore, the earliest available time for the meeting is from 11:00 to 11:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9,\n        \"end\": 17\n    }\n\n    # Define participants' schedules\n    steven_schedule = []\n    roy_schedule = []\n    cynthia_schedule = [[9.5, 10.5], [11.5, 12], [13, 13.5], [15, 16]]\n    lauren_schedule = [[9, 9.5], [10.5, 11], [11.5, 12], [13, 13.5], [14, 14.5], [15, 15.5], [16, 17]]\n    robert_schedule = [[10.5, 11], [11.5, 12], [12.5, 13.5], [14, 16]]\n\n    # Combine all schedules\n    all_schedules = [\n        steven_schedule,\n        roy_schedule,\n        cynthia_schedule,\n        lauren_schedule,\n        robert_schedule\n    ]\n\n    # Flatten and sort all busy intervals\n    all_busy = []\n    for schedule in all_schedules:\n        all_busy.extend(schedule)\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Initialize previous end time to work hours start\n    prev_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n\n    # Iterate through each busy interval\n    for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n        # Check for available slot before the busy interval starts\n        if busy_start - prev_end >= 0.5:  # 0.5 hours = 30 minutes\n            # Format the time slots\n            start_time = prev_end\n            end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n            # Convert to HH:MM format\n            start_hh = int(start_time)\n            start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n            end_hh = int(end_time)\n            end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n            # Return the earliest available time\n            return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n        \n        # Update previous end time\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, busy_end)\n\n    # Check for available slot after the last busy interval\n    if work_hours[\"end\"] - prev_end >= 0.5:\n        start_time = prev_end\n        end_time = prev_end + 0.5\n        start_hh = int(start_time)\n        start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n        end_hh = int(end_time)\n        end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n        return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
