Both have existing schedules, so I need to find a time slot where neither of them is busy.\n\nFirst, I'll list out their busy times:\n\n- **Lisa's Schedule:**\n  - 9:00 to 9:30\n  - 10:30 to 11:00\n  - 14:00 to 16:00\n\n- **Anthony's Schedule:**\n  - 9:00 to 9:30\n  - 11:00 to 11:30\n  - 12:30 to 13:30\n  - 14:00 to 15:00\n  - 15:30 to 16:00\n  - 16:30 to 17:00\n\nNext, I'll convert these times into minutes to make it easier to work with in the code:\n\n- **Lisa in minutes:**\n  - 9:00 \u2192 540\n  - 9:30 \u2192 570\n  - 10:30 \u2192 630\n  - 11:00 \u2192 660\n  - 14:00 \u2192 840\n  - 16:00 \u2192 960\n\n- **Anthony in minutes:**\n  - 9:00 \u2192 540\n  - 9:30 \u2192 570\n  - 11:00 \u2192 660\n  - 11:30 \u2192 690\n  - 12:30 \u2192 750\n  - 13:30 \u2192 810\n  - 14:00 \u2192 840\n  - 15:00 \u2192 900\n  - 15:30 \u2192 930\n  - 16:00 \u2192 960\n  - 16:30 \u2192 990\n  - 17:00 \u2192 1020\n\nNow, I'll combine their busy intervals and sort them by start time to identify all the times when at least one of them is busy.\n\nCombined busy intervals in minutes:\n\n- [540, 570] (both)\n- [630, 660] (Lisa)\n- [660, 690] (Anthony)\n- [750, 810] (Anthony)\n- [840, 900] (both)\n- [930, 960] (Anthony)\n- [990, 1020] (Anthony)\n\nNext, I'll check each possible 30-minute slot starting from 9:00 (540 minutes) to 16:30 (990 minutes) to find the earliest time when both are free.\n\n- **9:00 to 9:30 (540-570):** Both busy.\n- **9:30 to 10:00 (570-600):** Lisa is free, Anthony is free. This slot works.\n\nSince the goal is to find the earliest available time, I can stop here. The earliest available slot is 9:30 to 10:00.\n\nNow, I'll format this time in HH:MM:HH:MM as required.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes and meeting duration\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define busy intervals for each participant in minutes\n    lisa_busy = [\n        [9*60, 9*60+30],   # 9:00-9:30\n        [10*60+30, 11*60], # 10:30-11:00\n        [14*60, 16*60]     # 14:00-16:00\n    ]\n\n    anthony_busy = [\n        [9*60, 9*60+30],   # 9:00-9:30\n        [11*60, 11*60+30], # 11:00-11:30\n        [12*60+30, 13*60+30], # 12:30-13:30\n        [14*60, 15*60],    # 14:00-15:00\n        [15*60+30, 16*60], # 15:30-16:00\n        [16*60+30, 17*60]  # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Combine busy intervals\n    all_busy = lisa_busy + anthony_busy\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Check each possible time slot\n    for time in range(work_start, work_end - duration + 1):\n        current_time = time\n        end_slot = time + duration\n\n        # Check availability for both participants\n        available = True\n        for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n            if not (end_slot <= busy_start or current_time >= busy_end):\n                available = False\n                break\n\n        if available:\n            # Convert time to HH:MM format\n            start_hour = current_time // 60\n            start_minute = current_time % 60\n            end_hour = end_slot // 60\n            end_minute = end_slot % 60\n\n            return f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per the problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
