The task is to schedule a 30-minute meeting for seven participants on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, considering their busy times. \n\nFirst, I'll list out each participant's schedule to understand their availability better.\n\n- **Gregory**: Busy from 9:00-9:30 and 11:30-12:00.\n- **Jonathan**: Busy from 9:00-9:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n- **Barbara**: Busy from 10:00-10:30 and 13:30-14:00.\n- **Jesse**: Busy from 10:00-11:00 and 12:30-14:30.\n- **Alan**: Busy from 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-15:30, and 16:00-17:00.\n- **Nicole**: Busy from 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, and 14:00-17:00.\n- **Catherine**: Busy from 9:00-10:30, 12:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nNext, I'll convert all these times into minutes from midnight to make it easier to handle them programmatically. For example, 9:00 becomes 540 minutes, and 17:00 becomes 1020 minutes.\n\nNow, I'll create a list of all busy intervals for each participant and combine them into a single list for all participants. This combined list will help identify any overlapping busy times.\n\nAfter combining, I'll sort these intervals by their start times. This sorting helps in easily identifying free slots between the busy periods.\n\nOnce the intervals are sorted, I'll iterate through each possible 30-minute slot within the work hours (from 540 to 990 minutes) and check if the slot is free for all participants. This involves ensuring that the slot doesn't overlap with any of the busy intervals.\n\nIf I find a slot that's free for everyone, I'll convert the start and end times back to HH:MM format and return it as the meeting time.\n\nFinally, I'll execute the function to find the earliest available time that suits all participants.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes and meeting duration\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n    duration = 30\n\n    # Define busy intervals for each participant in minutes\n    schedules = {\n        \"Gregory\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [11*60+30, 12*60]],\n        \"Jonathan\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [12*60, 12*60+30], [13*60, 13*60+30], [15*60, 16*60], [16*60+30, 17*60]],\n        \"Barbara\": [[10*60, 10*60+30], [13*60+30, 14*60]],\n        \"Jesse\": [[10*60, 11*60], [12*60+30, 14*60+30]],\n        \"Alan\": [[9*60+30, 11*60], [11*60+30, 12*60+30], [13*60, 15*60+30], [16*60, 17*60]],\n        \"Nicole\": [[9*60, 10*60+30], [11*60+30, 12*60], [12*60+30, 13*60+30], [14*60, 17*60]],\n        \"Catherine\": [[9*60, 10*60+30], [12*60, 13*60+30], [15*60, 15*60+30], [16*60, 16*60+30]]\n    }\n\n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    all_busy = []\n    for person, busy_times in schedules.items():\n        all_busy.extend(busy_times)\n\n    # Sort busy intervals by start time\n    all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Check each possible time slot\n    for time in range(work_start, work_end - duration + 1):\n        current_time = time\n        end_slot = time + duration\n\n        # Check availability for all participants\n        available = True\n        for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n            if not (end_slot <= busy_start or current_time >= busy_end):\n                available = False\n                break\n\n        if available:\n            # Convert time to HH:MM format\n            start_hour = current_time // 60\n            start_minute = current_time % 60\n            end_hour = end_slot // 60\n            end_minute = end_slot % 60\n\n            return f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per the problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
