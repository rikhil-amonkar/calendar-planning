Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the task is to find a 30-minute meeting time for Arthur and Michael. The meeting has to be between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. But wait, Arthur can't meet on Tuesday, so we can only consider Monday and Wednesday.\n\nNext, I'll look at both their schedules to find overlapping free slots.\n\nStarting with Monday:\n\nArthur's schedule on Monday:\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 13:30-14:00\n- 15:00-15:30\n\nMichael's schedule on Monday:\n- 9:00-12:00\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 14:00-14:30\n- 15:00-17:00\n\nI need to find when both are free. Let's map out their busy times and see the gaps.\n\nFrom 9:00 to 11:00, Arthur is free, but Michael is busy until 12:00. So no slot there.\n\nAfter Arthur's 11:00-11:30 meeting, the next slot is 11:30-13:30. But Michael is busy until 12:00 and then again from 12:30-13:00. So possible free time is 12:00-12:30. That's a 30-minute slot. Let me check: from 12:00 to 12:30, Arthur is free, and Michael is free between 12:00-12:30 (since his next meeting starts at 12:30). So that's a possible time on Monday.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure it's within work hours. 12:00-12:30 is fine.\n\nNow, moving to Wednesday since we need the earliest possible time.\n\nArthur's Wednesday schedule:\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 12:00-12:30\n- 14:00-14:30\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nMichael's Wednesday schedule:\n- 10:00-12:30\n- 13:00-13:30\n\nLooking for overlapping free times. Let's check from 9:00 onwards.\n\nFrom 9:00 to 10:00, Arthur is free, but Michael starts at 10:00. So no slot there.\n\nAfter Arthur's 10:30-11:00, but Michael is busy until 12:30. So next possible after 12:30.\n\nBetween 12:30-13:00, Arthur is free (since his next meeting is at 14:00), and Michael is free until 13:00. So from 12:30 to 13:00, but that's only 30 minutes. Wait, the meeting needs to be 30 minutes, so 12:30-13:00 is possible. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, Arthur's meetings on Wednesday are at 10:00-10:30, then 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30. So after 12:30, he's free until 14:00. Michael is busy until 12:30, so from 12:30 to 13:00, Michael is free (since his next meeting is at 13:00). So yes, 12:30-13:00 is a possible slot on Wednesday.\n\nBut wait, the earliest possible time is preferred. So between Monday's 12:00 and Wednesday's 12:30, Monday is earlier. So the meeting should be on Monday at 12:00-12:30.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. On Monday, Arthur is free from 11:30 to 13:30, but he has a meeting at 13:30. Michael is free from 12:00 to 12:30 (since his next meeting starts at 12:30). So yes, 12:00-12:30 on Monday works for both.\n\nSo the solution is Monday at 12:00-12:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9,\n        \"end\": 17\n    }\n\n    # Define participants' schedules\n    arthur_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [[11, 11.5], [13.5, 14], [15, 15.5]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[13, 13.5], [16, 16.5]],\n        \"Wednesday\": [[10, 10.5], [11, 11.5], [12, 12.5], [14, 14.5], [16, 16.5]]\n    }\n\n    michael_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [[9, 12], [12.5, 13], [14, 14.5], [15, 17]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[9.5, 11.5], [12, 13.5], [14, 15.5]],\n        \"Wednesday\": [[10, 12.5], [13, 13.5]]\n    }\n\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    meeting_duration = 0.5  # In hours (30 minutes)\n\n    # Define the days to check (Arthur cannot meet on Tuesday)\n    days_to_check = [\"Monday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n\n    # Iterate through each day\n    for day in days_to_check:\n        # Combine and sort all busy intervals for both participants\n        arthur_busy = arthur_schedule[day]\n        michael_busy = michael_schedule[day]\n        all_busy = sorted(arthur_busy + michael_busy, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n        # Initialize previous end time to work hours start\n        prev_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n\n        # Iterate through each busy interval\n        for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n            # Check for available slot before the busy interval starts\n            if busy_start - prev_end >= meeting_duration:\n                # Format the time slots\n                start_time = prev_end\n                end_time = prev_end + meeting_duration\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_hh = int(start_time)\n                start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n                end_hh = int(end_time)\n                end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n                # Return the earliest available time\n                return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on {day}\"\n            \n            # Update previous end time\n            prev_end = max(prev_end, busy_end)\n\n        # Check for available slot after the last busy interval\n        if work_hours[\"end\"] - prev_end >= meeting_duration:\n            start_time = prev_end\n            end_time = prev_end + meeting_duration\n            start_hh = int(start_time)\n            start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n            end_hh = int(end_time)\n            end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n            return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
