            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to find a suitable time for a meeting between Daniel and Bradley. The meeting should be half an hour long, and it can be scheduled on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday between 9:00 and 17:00. However, there are some constraints:\n\n1. **Daniel's Preferences:**\n   - He would rather not meet on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\n2. **Bradley's Preferences:**\n   - He does not want to meet on Monday or Friday.\n   - On Tuesday, he prefers not to have meetings before 12:00.\n\nGiven these constraints, the possible days for the meeting are Tuesday and Wednesday. However, Daniel prefers not to meet on Wednesday, so the best option is Tuesday after 12:00.\n\nNow, I'll look at both Daniel's and Bradley's schedules for Tuesday.\n\n**Daniel's Schedule on Tuesday:**\n- 11:00 to 12:00\n- 13:00 to 13:30\n- 15:30 to 16:00\n- 16:30 to 17:00\n\n**Bradley's Schedule on Tuesday:**\n- 10:30 to 11:00\n- 12:00 to 13:00\n- 13:30 to 14:00\n- 15:30 to 16:30\n\nI need to find a 30-minute slot on Tuesday after 12:00 where neither Daniel nor Bradley has any meetings.\n\nLet's list out the busy periods:\n\n- **Daniel:**\n  - 11:00-12:00\n  - 13:00-13:30\n  - 15:30-16:00\n  - 16:30-17:00\n\n- **Bradley:**\n  - 10:30-11:00\n  - 12:00-13:00\n  - 13:30-14:00\n  - 15:30-16:30\n\nNow, let's look for gaps between these meetings where both are free.\n\n1. **12:00-13:00:**\n   - Bradley is busy until 13:00.\n   - Daniel is free from 12:00 to 13:00, but Bradley is busy until 13:00.\n\n2. **13:00-13:30:**\n   - Daniel is busy from 13:00 to 13:30.\n   - Bradley is free from 13:00 to 13:30.\n\n3. **13:30-14:00:**\n   - Bradley is busy from 13:30 to 14:00.\n   - Daniel is free from 13:30 to 14:00.\n\n4. **14:00-15:30:**\n   - Both Daniel and Bradley are free between 14:00 and 15:30.\n\n5. **15:30-16:00:**\n   - Daniel is busy from 15:30 to 16:00.\n   - Bradley is busy from 15:30 to 16:30.\n\n6. **16:00-16:30:**\n   - Daniel is free from 16:00 to 16:30.\n   - Bradley is busy until 16:30.\n\n7. **16:30-17:00:**\n   - Daniel is busy from 16:30 to 17:00.\n   - Bradley is free from 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only time slot where both are free is between 14:00 and 15:30. Since the meeting duration is 30 minutes, I can schedule the meeting from 14:00 to 14:30.\n\nThis time slot does not conflict with any of their meetings, respects their preferences regarding days, and fits within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each participant\n    daniel_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 30, 10, 30), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 14, 0), (14, 30, 15, 0), (15, 30, 16, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(11, 0, 12, 0), (13, 0, 13, 30), (15, 30, 16, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9, 0, 10, 0), (14, 0, 14, 30)],\n        \"Thursday\": [(10, 30, 11, 0), (12, 0, 13, 0), (14, 30, 15, 0), (15, 30, 16, 0)],\n        \"Friday\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (11, 30, 12, 0), (13, 0, 13, 30), (16, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    bradley_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [(9, 30, 11, 0), (11, 30, 12, 0), (12, 30, 13, 0), (14, 0, 15, 0)],\n        \"Tuesday\": [(10, 30, 11, 0), (12, 0, 13, 0), (13, 30, 14, 0), (15, 30, 16, 30)],\n        \"Wednesday\": [(9, 0, 10, 0), (11, 0, 13, 0), (13, 30, 14, 0), (14, 30, 17, 0)],\n        \"Thursday\": [(9, 0, 12, 30), (13, 30, 14, 0), (14, 30, 15, 0), (15, 30, 16, 30)],\n        \"Friday\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (10, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 13, 30), (14, 0, 14, 30), (15, 30, 16, 30)]\n    }\n\n    # Preferences\n    daniel_preferences = [\"Tuesday\", \"Friday\"]  # Days Daniel prefers not to meet\n    bradley_preferences = [\"Monday\", \"Friday\"]  # Days Bradley prefers not to meet\n    bradley_tuesday_before_12 = False  # Bradley does not want to meet on Tuesday before 12:00\n\n    # Convert time ranges to minutes since midnight for easier calculations\n    def time_to_minutes(hours, minutes):\n        return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n    # Define the possible days, considering preferences\n    possible_days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n    possible_days = [day for day in possible_days if day not in daniel_preferences and day not in bradley_preferences]\n\n    # Iterate through each possible day\n    for day in possible_days:\n        # Get both schedules for the day\n        daniel_schedule_day = daniel_schedule[day]\n        bradley_schedule_day = bradley_schedule[day]\n\n        # Combine and sort all busy intervals\n        all_busy = daniel_schedule_day + bradley_schedule_day\n        all_busy.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n        # Check each possible time slot\n        start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n        end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n\n        # Iterate through each 30-minute slot\n        while start_time < end_time:\n            current_end = start_time + 30\n            if current_end > end_time:\n                current_end = end_time\n\n            # Convert start and end times back to HH:MM format\n            start_hh, start_mm = divmod(start_time, 60)\n            end_hh, end_mm = divmod(current_end, 60)\n\n            # Check if this time slot works for everyone\n            works_for_all = True\n            for schedule in [daniel_schedule_day, bradley_schedule_day]:\n                for meeting in schedule:\n                    meeting_start = time_to_minutes(meeting[0], meeting[1])\n                    meeting_end = time_to_minutes(meeting[2], meeting[3])\n\n                    # Check overlap\n                    if not (current_end <= meeting_start or start_time >= meeting_end):\n                        works_for_all = False\n                        break\n                if not works_for_all:\n                    break\n\n            if works_for_all:\n                # Additional preference checks\n                if day == \"Tuesday\" and start_time < 12 * 60:\n                    continue  # Bradley does not want to meet on Tuesday before 12:00\n                return f\"{day}: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}-{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n\n            start_time += 30  # Move to the next 30-minute slot\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
