Let me read through the task carefully.\n\nSo, there are seven people: Wayne, Melissa, Catherine, Gregory, Victoria, Thomas, and Jennifer. I need to schedule a half-hour meeting between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Each person has their own busy times, and Wayne prefers to avoid meetings before 14:00.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy periods:\n\n- Wayne: Free all day, but prefers after 14:00.\n- Melissa: Busy 10:00-11:00, 12:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30.\n- Catherine: Free all day.\n- Gregory: Busy 12:30-13:00, 15:30-16:00.\n- Victoria: Busy 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:30.\n- Thomas: Busy 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-16:00.\n- Jennifer: Busy 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-13:00, 13:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nI need to find a 30-minute slot where all are free. Also, Wayne prefers after 14:00, so I'll focus on that time.\n\nLet me start by considering the time after 14:00. The work hours go up to 17:00, so possible slots could be 14:00-14:30, 14:30-15:00, etc.\n\nBut I need to check each person's availability in these slots.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nStarting from 14:00 onwards, check each 30-minute block.\n\nFirst, 14:00-14:30:\n\n- Wayne: Available.\n- Melissa: Her busy times are 10:00-11:00, 12:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30. So at 14:00, she's free after 14:00.\n- Catherine: Free.\n- Gregory: Busy until 13:00, then free until 15:30. So 14:00 is free.\n- Victoria: Busy until 15:00? Wait, Victoria's busy times include 14:30-15:00. So at 14:00, she's free until 14:30.\n- Thomas: Busy until 16:00 starting from 14:30. So 14:00-14:30 is free for Thomas.\n- Jennifer: Busy until 14:30. So 14:00-14:30 is busy for her.\n\nSo Jennifer is busy during 14:00-14:30. So this slot doesn't work.\n\nNext slot: 14:30-15:00.\n\nCheck each person:\n\n- Wayne: Available.\n- Melissa: Busy until 14:00, then free. She has a meeting at 15:00-15:30, so 14:30-15:00 is free for her.\n- Catherine: Free.\n- Gregory: Busy 15:30-16:00, so 14:30 is free.\n- Victoria: Busy 14:30-15:00, so she's not available.\n  \nSo Victoria is busy here. Can't use this slot.\n\nNext slot: 15:00-15:30.\n\nCheck:\n\n- Wayne: Available.\n- Melissa: Busy 15:00-15:30. So she's not available.\n  \nSo this slot is out.\n\nNext slot: 15:30-16:00.\n\nCheck:\n\n- Wayne: Available.\n- Melissa: Free after 15:30.\n- Catherine: Free.\n- Gregory: Busy 15:30-16:00. So he's not available.\n  \nSo Gregory is busy. Can't use this slot.\n\nNext slot: 16:00-16:30.\n\nCheck:\n\n- Wayne: Available.\n- Melissa: Free.\n- Catherine: Free.\n- Gregory: Free after 16:00.\n- Victoria: Busy until 16:30. So 16:00-16:30 is her busy time.\n  \nSo Victoria is busy here.\n\nNext slot: 16:30-17:00.\n\nCheck:\n\n- Wayne: Available.\n- Melissa: Free.\n- Catherine: Free.\n- Gregory: Free.\n- Victoria: Free after 16:30.\n- Thomas: Busy until 16:00. So 16:30 is free.\n- Jennifer: Busy until 16:30. So 16:30-17:00 is free for her.\n\nWait, Jennifer's last busy time is 16:00-16:30. So she's free at 16:30.\n\nSo in 16:30-17:00, everyone is available except let me double-check.\n\nWait, Victoria is busy until 16:30, so 16:30 and beyond is free. So yes.\n\nSo this slot seems available.\n\nWait, but let me check each person again:\n\nWayne: Yes.\n\nMelissa: Her last busy is 15:00-15:30, so after that she's free.\n\nCatherine: Yes.\n\nGregory: His last busy is 15:30-16:00, so after 16:00 he's free.\n\nVictoria: Busy until 16:30, so 16:30 onwards is free.\n\nThomas: Busy until 16:00, so 16:30 is free.\n\nJennifer: Busy until 16:30, so 16:30 onwards is free.\n\nSo yes, 16:30-17:00 works for everyone.\n\nWait, but the meeting is half an hour, so 16:30 to 17:00 is exactly 30 minutes.\n\nBut wait, let me check if all are free during that time.\n\nYes, because all their busy times end by 16:30, so 16:30 onwards is free.\n\nSo that's a possible slot.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's an earlier slot after 14:00 that works. Because maybe I missed something.\n\nEarlier, I checked 14:00-14:30, but Jennifer was busy. 14:30-15:00, Victoria was busy. 15:00-15:30, Melissa was busy. 15:30-16:00, Gregory was busy. 16:00-16:30, Victoria was busy. So the next is 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo that's the only slot after 14:00 that works.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's any slot before 14:00 that works, just in case. Because sometimes, even if Wayne prefers after 14:00, maybe the only available slot is before. But the problem says there's a solution, so I think 16:30 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in checking. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a slot between 13:00 and 14:00. But Wayne prefers after 14:00, but maybe that's the only option. Let me check.\n\nWait, the user said Wayne would like to avoid more meetings before 14:00, but it's a preference, not a hard constraint. So if the only available time is before 14:00, that's acceptable. But since the problem says there's a solution that works for everyone, I think the 16:30 slot is the intended answer.\n\nSo the meeting should be scheduled at 16:30-17:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the day and work hours\n    day = \"Monday\"\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # Convert hours to minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60\n\n    # Meeting duration in minutes\n    duration = 30\n\n    # Define busy intervals for each participant in minutes\n    schedules = {\n        \"Wayne\": [],\n        \"Melissa\": [[10*60, 11*60], [12*60+30, 14*60], [15*60, 15*60+30]],\n        \"Catherine\": [],\n        \"Gregory\": [[12*60+30, 13*60], [15*60+30, 16*60]],\n        \"Victoria\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [10*60+30, 11*60+30], [13*60, 14*60], [14*60+30, 15*60], [15*60+30, 16*60+30]],\n        \"Thomas\": [[10*60, 12*60], [12*60+30, 13*60], [14*60+30, 16*60]],\n        \"Jennifer\": [[9*60, 9*60+30], [10*60, 10*60+30], [11*60, 13*60], [13*60+30, 14*60+30], [15*60, 15*60+30], [16*60, 16*60+30]]\n    }\n\n    # Check each possible time slot\n    for time in range(start_time, end_time - duration + 1):\n        # Convert time to HH:MM format\n        current_time = time\n        end_slot = time + duration\n\n        # Check availability for all participants\n        available = True\n        for person, busy_times in schedules.items():\n            for busy_start, busy_end in busy_times:\n                # Check if the current slot overlaps with any busy time\n                if not (end_slot <= busy_start or current_time >= busy_end):\n                    available = False\n                    break\n            if not available:\n                break\n\n        if available:\n            # Convert time to HH:MM format\n            start_hour = current_time // 60\n            start_minute = current_time % 60\n            end_hour = end_slot // 60\n            end_minute = end_slot % 60\n\n            # Format the output\n            return f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}-{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per the problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
