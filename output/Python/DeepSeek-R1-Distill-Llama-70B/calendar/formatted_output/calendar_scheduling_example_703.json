They need to meet for one hour between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM, and it can be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. But there are some constraints.\n\nFirst, I'll look at their schedules.\n\nStephanie's schedule:\n- Monday: Busy from 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, and 14:00-14:30.\n- Tuesday: Busy from 12:00-13:00.\n- Wednesday: Busy from 9:00-10:00 and 13:00-14:00.\n\nBetty's schedule:\n- Monday: Busy from 9:00-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 14:30-15:00, and 15:30-16:00.\n- Tuesday: Busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-14:30, and 15:30-16:00.\n- Wednesday: Busy from 10:00-11:30, 12:00-14:00, and 14:30-17:00.\n\nAdditionally, Stephanie wants to avoid more meetings on Monday, and Betty cannot meet on Tuesday after 12:30.\n\nSo, I need to find a one-hour slot that doesn't conflict with either of their schedules, considering these preferences.\n\nLet me start by listing all possible one-hour slots from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, in 30-minute increments, across the three days.\n\nThen, I'll go through each day and each time slot to see if both are available.\n\nStarting with Monday:\n\n- 9:00-10:00: Stephanie is free except for 9:30-10:00. Betty is busy until 10:00. So, 9:30-10:30 might overlap.\n- 10:00-11:00: Stephanie is busy from 10:30-11:00. Betty is free from 10:00-11:00. But since Stephanie is busy at 10:30, this slot won't work.\n- 11:00-12:00: Stephanie is busy from 11:30-12:00. Betty is busy from 11:00-11:30. So, overlapping again.\n- 12:00-13:00: Both seem free on Monday.\n- 13:00-14:00: Stephanie is free. Betty is busy from 14:30, but 13:00-14:00 might still work.\n- 14:00-15:00: Stephanie is busy until 14:30. Betty is busy from 14:30-15:00.\n- 15:00-16:00: Betty is busy from 15:30-16:00.\n- 16:00-17:00: Both seem free.\n\nBut since Stephanie wants to avoid Monday, let's check other days.\n\nTuesday:\n\n- 9:00-10:00: Stephanie is free. Betty is busy until 9:30.\n- 10:00-11:00: Both are free.\n- 11:00-12:00: Stephanie is free. Betty is busy from 11:30-12:00.\n- 12:00-13:00: Stephanie is busy. Betty is busy until 12:30.\n- 13:00-14:00: Stephanie is free. Betty is busy from 12:30-14:30.\n- 14:00-15:00: Stephanie is free. Betty is busy until 14:30.\n- 15:00-16:00: Betty cannot meet after 12:30 on Tuesday.\n- 16:00-17:00: Both are free, but Betty's constraint applies.\n\nWednesday:\n\n- 9:00-10:00: Stephanie is busy.\n- 10:00-11:00: Stephanie is free. Betty is busy until 11:30.\n- 11:00-12:00: Stephanie is free. Betty is busy from 10:00-11:30.\n- 12:00-13:00: Both are free.\n- 13:00-14:00: Stephanie is busy.\n- 14:00-15:00: Stephanie is free. Betty is busy from 14:30.\n- 15:00-16:00: Both are free.\n- 16:00-17:00: Both are free.\n\nConsidering all this, the best options seem to be on Wednesday at 12:00-13:00 or 15:00-16:00. Both slots don't conflict with their schedules and meet the constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each participant as dictionaries with their busy intervals\n    schedules = {\n        'Stephanie': {\n            'Monday': [(9*60 + 30, 10*60), (10*60 + 30, 11*60), (11*60 + 30, 12*60), (14*60, 14*60 + 30)],\n            'Tuesday': [(12*60, 13*60)],\n            'Wednesday': [(9*60, 10*60), (13*60, 14*60)]\n        },\n        'Betty': {\n            'Monday': [(9*60, 10*60), (11*60, 11*60 + 30), (14*60 + 30, 15*60), (15*60 + 30, 16*60)],\n            'Tuesday': [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (11*60 + 30, 12*60), (12*60 + 30, 14*60 + 30), (15*60 + 30, 16*60)],\n            'Wednesday': [(10*60, 11*60 + 30), (12*60, 14*60), (14*60 + 30, 17*60)]\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Generate all possible 60-minute time slots between 9:00 and 17:00\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    time_slots = []\n    for t in range(start_time, end_time - 60, 30):\n        time_slots.append((t, t + 60))\n\n    # Check each time slot against both participants' schedules\n    for day in ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']:\n        for slot in time_slots:\n            start, end = slot\n            stephanie_available = True\n            for busy_start, busy_end in schedules['Stephanie'][day]:\n                if not (end <= busy_start or start >= busy_end):\n                    stephanie_available = False\n                    break\n            if not stephanie_available:\n                continue\n\n            betty_available = True\n            for busy_start, busy_end in schedules['Betty'][day]:\n                if not (end <= busy_start or start >= busy_end):\n                    betty_available = False\n                    break\n            if betty_available:\n                # Check Betty's Tuesday constraint\n                if day == 'Tuesday' and end > 12*60 + 30:\n                    continue\n\n                # Convert the time slot back to HH:MM format\n                hours_start = start // 60\n                minutes_start = start % 60\n                hours_end = end // 60\n                minutes_end = end % 60\n                return f\"The proposed meeting time is {hours_start:02d}:{minutes_start:02d}:{hours_end:02d}:{minutes_end:02d} on {day}.\"\n\n    # If no time slot found (though the problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No available time slot found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time()\nprint(meeting_time)\n```",
