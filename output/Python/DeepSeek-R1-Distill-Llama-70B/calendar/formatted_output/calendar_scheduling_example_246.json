            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to figure out how to schedule a meeting for Jacob, Diana, Adam, Angela, and Dennis on Monday. The meeting should be half an hour long, and it has to be between 9:00 and 17:00. Each person has their own busy times, so I need to find a time slot where none of them have any meetings.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times:\n\n- **Jacob**: 13:30-14:00 and 14:30-15:00\n- **Diana**: 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 16:00-16:30\n- **Adam**: 9:30-10:30, 11:00-12:30, 15:30-16:00\n- **Angela**: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n- **Dennis**: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:30, 13:00-15:00, 16:30-17:00\n\nI need to find a 30-minute window where none of these times overlap for all five people. It might help to visualize their schedules on a timeline.\n\nLet me look at the earliest start time, which is 9:00, but Dennis is busy until 9:30. So the earliest possible start is 9:30. But Diana, Adam, and Angela are all busy from 9:30 onwards. So 9:30 is out.\n\nNext, looking at the end of the day, after 16:00, Angela and Diana are busy until 16:30, and Dennis is busy from 16:30 to 17:00. So the latest possible end time is 16:30, but that's when Dennis starts. So maybe between 15:30 and 16:00? Let's check:\n\n- **Jacob**: Free from 15:00 to 15:30 is busy, but 15:30 onwards he's free until 14:30-15:00 is his busy time? Wait, Jacob is busy until 14:00 and then again at 14:30. So from 15:00 onwards, Jacob is free.\n\n- **Diana**: Busy until 16:00, so she's free after 16:00, but that's when others are busy.\n\nWait, I need to check each person's availability in each time slot.\n\nLooking at the time between 12:00 and 13:00. Let's see:\n\n- **Jacob**: Free\n- **Diana**: Free\n- **Adam**: Busy until 12:30, so from 12:30 to 13:00 he's free\n- **Angela**: Busy until 12:00, so from 12:00 to 13:00 she's free\n- **Dennis**: Busy until 11:30, then free until 13:00 when he gets busy again\n\nSo from 12:30 to 13:00, everyone except Dennis is free. But Dennis is busy from 13:00 onwards, so 12:30 to 13:00 might be possible.\n\nBut wait, the meeting needs to be 30 minutes. So starting at 12:30 would end at 13:00, which is exactly when Dennis becomes busy. So that might not work.\n\nLet me check another slot. How about between 15:00 and 15:30?\n\n- **Jacob**: Free\n- **Diana**: Free\n- **Adam**: Busy until 15:30\n- **Angela**: Busy until 15:30\n- **Dennis**: Busy until 15:00, then free until 16:30\n\nSo from 15:00 to 15:30, Adam and Angela are busy. So that's not good.\n\nWhat about 14:00 to 14:30?\n\n- **Jacob**: Busy until 14:00, then free from 14:00 to 14:30\n- **Diana**: Free\n- **Adam**: Free\n- **Angela**: Busy until 15:30\n- **Dennis**: Busy until 15:00\n\nSo Angela is busy until 15:30, so 14:00 to 14:30 is out.\n\nHmm, maybe earlier in the day. Let's see between 10:00 and 11:00.\n\n- **Jacob**: Free\n- **Diana**: Busy from 9:30-10:00 and 11:30-12:00\n- **Adam**: Busy from 9:30-10:30\n- **Angela**: Busy from 9:30-10:00 and 10:30-12:00\n- **Dennis**: Busy from 9:00-9:30 and 10:30-11:30\n\nSo from 10:00 to 10:30, Adam and Angela are busy. From 10:30 to 11:00, Dennis is busy. So no slot there.\n\nWhat about between 11:00 and 11:30?\n\n- **Jacob**: Free\n- **Diana**: Busy from 11:30-12:00\n- **Adam**: Busy from 11:00-12:30\n- **Angela**: Busy from 10:30-12:00\n- **Dennis**: Busy from 10:30-11:30\n\nSo from 11:00 to 11:30, Adam, Angela, and Dennis are busy. No go.\n\nLooking at the afternoon, after 15:00:\n\n- **Jacob**: Free from 15:00 onwards\n- **Diana**: Free from 16:00 onwards\n- **Adam**: Busy until 15:30\n- **Angela**: Busy until 15:30\n- **Dennis**: Free from 15:00 to 16:30\n\nSo from 15:30 to 16:00:\n\n- **Jacob**: Free\n- **Diana**: Free\n- **Adam**: Free from 15:30\n- **Angela**: Free from 15:30\n- **Dennis**: Free until 16:30\n\nSo 15:30 to 16:00 seems to work for everyone. Let me double-check:\n\n- **Jacob**: Not busy during 15:30-16:00\n- **Diana**: Not busy during 15:30-16:00\n- **Adam**: Free after 15:30\n- **Angela**: Free after 15:30\n- **Dennis**: Free until 16:30\n\nYes, this slot works. So the meeting can be scheduled from 15:30 to 16:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the schedules for each participant\n    schedules = {\n        \"Jacob\": [(13, 30, 14, 0), (14, 30, 15, 0)],\n        \"Diana\": [(9, 30, 10, 0), (11, 30, 12, 0), (13, 0, 13, 30), (16, 0, 16, 30)],\n        \"Adam\": [(9, 30, 10, 30), (11, 0, 12, 30), (15, 30, 16, 0)],\n        \"Angela\": [(9, 30, 10, 0), (10, 30, 12, 0), (13, 0, 15, 30), (16, 0, 16, 30)],\n        \"Dennis\": [(9, 0, 9, 30), (10, 30, 11, 30), (13, 0, 15, 0), (16, 30, 17, 0)]\n    }\n\n    # Convert time ranges to minutes since midnight for easier calculations\n    def time_to_minutes(hours, minutes):\n        return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n    # Check each possible time slot\n    start_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    end_time = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n\n    # Iterate through each 30-minute slot\n    while start_time < end_time:\n        current_end = start_time + 30\n        if current_end > end_time:\n            current_end = end_time\n\n        # Convert start and end times back to HH:MM format\n        start_hh, start_mm = divmod(start_time, 60)\n        end_hh, end_mm = divmod(current_end, 60)\n\n        # Check if this time slot works for everyone\n        works_for_all = True\n        for name, schedule in schedules.items():\n            for meeting in schedule:\n                meeting_start = time_to_minutes(meeting[0], meeting[1])\n                meeting_end = time_to_minutes(meeting[2], meeting[3])\n                \n                # Check overlap\n                if not (current_end <= meeting_start or start_time >= meeting_end):\n                    works_for_all = False\n                    break\n            if not works_for_all:\n                break\n\n        if works_for_all:\n            return f\"Monday: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}-{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        \n        start_time += 30  # Move to the next 30-minute slot\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
