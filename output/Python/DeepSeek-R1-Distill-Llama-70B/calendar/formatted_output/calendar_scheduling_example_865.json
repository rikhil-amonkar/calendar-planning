The task is to find a suitable time for a meeting between Megan and Daniel, lasting one hour, between 9:00 and 17:00 from Monday to Thursday. Both have existing meetings, so I need to find a slot where neither of them is busy.\n\nFirst, I'll list out their schedules to visualize their availability.\n\n**Megan's Schedule:**\n- **Monday:** 13:00-13:30, 14:00-15:30\n- **Tuesday:** 9:00-9:30, 12:00-12:30, 16:00-17:00\n- **Wednesday:** 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:30-14:00, 16:00-16:30\n- **Thursday:** 13:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30\n\n**Daniel's Schedule:**\n- **Monday:** 10:00-11:30, 12:30-15:00\n- **Tuesday:** 9:00-10:00, 10:30-17:00\n- **Wednesday:** 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-17:00\n- **Thursday:** 9:00-12:00, 12:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n\nNow, I'll go through each day to find a common free slot.\n\n**Monday:**\n- Megan is free before 13:00, but Daniel is busy from 10:00. The earliest they could meet is after 9:00, but Daniel is busy until 10:00. The next potential slot is between 11:30 and 12:30. However, Megan is free from 11:30 to 13:00, but Daniel is busy until 12:30. So, from 12:30 to 13:00, Megan is still free, but Daniel is busy until 12:30. Thus, no slot available on Monday.\n\n**Tuesday:**\n- Megan is free from 9:30 to 12:00, but Daniel is busy from 9:00 to 10:00 and then from 10:30 onwards. The only potential slot is between 10:00 and 10:30, but Megan is busy at 9:00-9:30 and Daniel at 10:30. So, no slot available on Tuesday.\n\n**Wednesday:**\n- Megan is free between 11:30 and 12:30, but Daniel is busy from 12:00 onwards. Megan is also free from 14:00 to 16:00, but Daniel is busy until 17:00. So, no slot available on Wednesday.\n\n**Thursday:**\n- Megan is free before 13:30 and between 14:30 and 15:30. Daniel is busy until 12:00, then free from 12:00 to 12:30. However, Megan is busy from 13:30 to 14:30. The next potential slot is between 14:30 and 15:30. Megan is free from 14:30 to 15:30, and Daniel is free from 14:30 to 15:00. Thus, the meeting can be scheduled from 14:30 to 15:30.\n\nSo, the earliest available time that works for both is on Thursday from 14:30 to 15:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_hours = {\n        \"start\": 9,\n        \"end\": 17\n    }\n\n    # Define participants' schedules\n    megan_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [[13, 13.5], [14, 15.5]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[9, 9.5], [12, 12.5], [16, 17]],\n        \"Wednesday\": [[9.5, 10], [10.5, 11.5], [12.5, 14], [16, 16.5]],\n        \"Thursday\": [[13.5, 14.5], [15, 15.5]]\n    }\n\n    daniel_schedule = {\n        \"Monday\": [[10, 11.5], [12.5, 15]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[9, 10], [10.5, 17]],\n        \"Wednesday\": [[9, 10], [10.5, 11.5], [12, 17]],\n        \"Thursday\": [[9, 12], [12.5, 14.5], [15, 15.5], [16, 17]]\n    }\n\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    meeting_duration = 1.0  # In hours (1 hour)\n\n    # Define the days to check\n    days_to_check = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\"]\n\n    # Iterate through each day\n    for day in days_to_check:\n        # Combine and sort all busy intervals for both participants\n        megan_busy = megan_schedule[day]\n        daniel_busy = daniel_schedule[day]\n        all_busy = sorted(megan_busy + daniel_busy, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n        # Initialize previous end time to work hours start\n        prev_end = work_hours[\"start\"]\n\n        # Iterate through each busy interval\n        for busy_start, busy_end in all_busy:\n            # Check for available slot before the busy interval starts\n            if busy_start - prev_end >= meeting_duration:\n                # Format the time slots\n                start_time = prev_end\n                end_time = prev_end + meeting_duration\n                # Convert to HH:MM format\n                start_hh = int(start_time)\n                start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n                end_hh = int(end_time)\n                end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n                # Return the earliest available time\n                return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on {day}\"\n            \n            # Update previous end time\n            prev_end = max(prev_end, busy_end)\n\n        # Check for available slot after the last busy interval\n        if work_hours[\"end\"] - prev_end >= meeting_duration:\n            start_time = prev_end\n            end_time = prev_end + meeting_duration\n            start_hh = int(start_time)\n            start_mm = int((start_time - start_hh) * 60)\n            end_hh = int(end_time)\n            end_mm = int((end_time - end_hh) * 60)\n            return f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}:{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d} on {day}\"\n\n    # If no time found (should not happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No available time found\"\n\n# Execute the function\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```",
