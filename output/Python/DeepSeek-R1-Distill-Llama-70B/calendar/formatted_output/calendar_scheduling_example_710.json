            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find a suitable time for a meeting between Cheryl and Kyle for half an hour, considering their availability from Monday to Wednesday, with Cheryl unable to meet on Wednesday. \n\nFirst, I'll outline the constraints:\n\n1. **Meeting Duration**: 30 minutes.\n2. **Work Hours**: 9:00 to 17:00.\n3. **Days Available**: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n4. **Cheryl's Availability**:\n   - **Monday**: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 13:00, and 15:30 to 16:00.\n   - **Tuesday**: Busy from 15:00 to 15:30.\n   - **Wednesday**: Not available.\n5. **Kyle's Availability**:\n   - **Monday**: Busy all day.\n   - **Tuesday**: Busy from 9:30 to 17:00.\n   - **Wednesday**: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 17:00.\n\nGiven that Cheryl cannot meet on Wednesday, we can immediately eliminate Wednesday from our options. This leaves us with Monday and Tuesday.\n\nNext, I'll analyze each day to find overlapping free slots that can accommodate a 30-minute meeting.\n\n**Monday**:\n- Cheryl is free from 9:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00.\n- Kyle is busy all day on Monday, so no available slots.\n\n**Tuesday**:\n- Cheryl is free from 9:00 to 15:00, excluding her busy slot from 15:00 to 15:30.\n- Kyle is busy from 9:30 to 17:00.\n\nLooking for overlapping free times on Tuesday:\n- Cheryl's available slots on Tuesday are:\n  - 9:00 to 15:00.\n- Kyle's available slots on Tuesday are:\n  - Before 9:30 (but Cheryl starts at 9:00).\n  - After 17:00, which is beyond our work hours.\n\nWait, Kyle is busy from 9:30 to 17:00 on Tuesday. So the only possible time before Kyle gets busy is between 9:00 and 9:30. Cheryl is available from 9:00 to 15:00, so the overlapping slot is from 9:00 to 9:30.\n\nBut we need a 30-minute slot, and this slot is exactly 30 minutes. So, the meeting can be scheduled from 9:00 to 9:30 on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Cheryl's availability on Tuesday starts at 9:00, and Kyle is available until 9:30. So, this slot works.\n\n**Wednesday**:\n- Cheryl is not available, so we skip this day.\n\nTherefore, the earliest available time that works for both Cheryl and Kyle, considering all constraints, is Tuesday from 9:00 to 9:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    start_time = \"09:00\"\n    end_time = \"17:00\"\n    \n    # Define participants' busy intervals as dictionaries with name and time ranges\n    participants = {\n        \"Cheryl\": {\n            \"Monday\": [\n                (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n                (\"11:30\", \"13:00\"),\n                (\"15:30\", \"16:00\")\n            ],\n            \"Tuesday\": [\n                (\"15:00\", \"15:30\")\n            ],\n            \"Wednesday\": []\n        },\n        \"Kyle\": {\n            \"Monday\": [\n                (\"09:00\", \"17:00\")\n            ],\n            \"Tuesday\": [\n                (\"09:30\", \"17:00\")\n            ],\n            \"Wednesday\": [\n                (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n                (\"10:00\", \"13:00\"),\n                (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"),\n                (\"14:30\", \"17:00\")\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Convert time strings to minutes since midnight for easier comparison\n    def time_to_minutes(time_str):\n        hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n        return hours * 60 + mins\n    \n    # Convert all busy intervals to minutes\n    busy_intervals = {}\n    for name, schedules in participants.items():\n        busy = {}\n        for day, intervals in schedules.items():\n            busy_day = []\n            for start, end in intervals:\n                busy_start = time_to_minutes(start)\n                busy_end = time_to_minutes(end)\n                busy_day.append((busy_start, busy_end))\n            busy[day] = busy_day\n        busy_intervals[name] = busy\n    \n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Generate all possible time slots within work hours\n    work_start = time_to_minutes(start_time)\n    work_end = time_to_minutes(end_time)\n    \n    # Find all available time slots for each participant\n    available_slots = {}\n    for name, schedules in busy_intervals.items():\n        available = {}\n        for day in [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]:\n            intervals = schedules.get(day, [])\n            available_day = []\n            previous_end = work_start\n            \n            # Add available slots before the first busy interval\n            if intervals and intervals[0][0] > previous_end:\n                available_day.append((previous_end, intervals[0][0]))\n            \n            # Add available slots between busy intervals\n            for i in range(1, len(intervals)):\n                current_start = intervals[i-1][1]\n                next_start = intervals[i][0]\n                if current_start < next_start:\n                    available_day.append((current_start, next_start))\n            \n            # Add available slots after the last busy interval\n            if intervals:\n                last_end = intervals[-1][1]\n                if last_end < work_end:\n                    available_day.append((last_end, work_end))\n            else:\n                # If no busy intervals, the entire work time is available\n                available_day.append((work_start, work_end))\n            \n            available[day] = available_day\n        available_slots[name] = available\n    \n    # Find overlapping available slots that can accommodate the meeting duration\n    cheryl_available = available_slots[\"Cheryl\"]\n    kyle_available = available_slots[\"Kyle\"]\n    \n    overlapping_slots = {}\n    for day in [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]:\n        cheryl_day_slots = cheryl_available.get(day, [])\n        kyle_day_slots = kyle_available.get(day, [])\n        \n        day_overlapping = []\n        for c_slot in cheryl_day_slots:\n            for k_slot in kyle_day_slots:\n                # Find the overlapping start and end\n                start = max(c_slot[0], k_slot[0])\n                end = min(c_slot[1], k_slot[1])\n                \n                if end -
