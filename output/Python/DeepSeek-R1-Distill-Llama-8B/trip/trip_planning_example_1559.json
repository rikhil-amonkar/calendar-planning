            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I'm faced with a complex task of creating a 25-day itinerary for visiting 10 European cities, considering various constraints such as required stays, meeting times, and direct flight availability. Let me break down how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll start by listing all the cities and their respective constraints. The cities involved are Valencia, Oslo, Lyon, Prague, Paris, Nice, Seville, Tallinn, Mykonos, and Lisbon. Each has a specific number of days to stay, and some have meeting or event timings.\n\nNext, I need to map out the direct flights between these cities. The provided list of direct flights will help me determine possible transitions between cities. It's crucial to ensure that each flight transition happens on the same day as the departure and arrival to meet the constraints.\n\nNow, I'll begin constructing the itinerary starting from the city with the earliest departure, which in this case is Valencia. From Valencia, I can fly to Paris, considering the direct flight availability.\n\nUpon arriving in Paris, I need to handle the annual show in Seville from day 5 to day 9. However, since the show is in Seville, I'll need to plan the trip to Seville accordingly, ensuring that the person attends the show during those days.\n\nAfter Seville, the next destination could be Nice, as there's a direct flight available. Staying in Nice for 4 days seems reasonable.\n\nFrom Nice, the person can move to Mykonos, given the direct flight. Mykonos has a wedding event between days 21 and 25, so I'll allocate the later days for this event.\n\nTallinn is another city to visit for 2 days, and since there's a direct flight from Paris to Tallinn, I'll schedule that after returning from Mykonos.\n\nLisbon is next, where the person can stay for 2 days. There are direct flights from both Nice and Mykonos to Lisbon, so I'll choose the earliest available.\n\nFinally, the itinerary will end in Lisbon, ensuring all constraints are met, including the required stays and meeting times.\n\nThroughout this process, I'll make sure that each transition between cities occurs on the same day as specified, ensuring that the last day in one place aligns with the flight day and the first day in the next place.\n\nBy following these steps, I can create a structured and logical itinerary that meets all the given constraints and efficiently transitions between cities using direct flights.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef compute_itinerary():\n    cities = {\n        \"Valencia\": {\"days\": 2, \"friends\": [3, 4]},\n        \"Oslo\": {\"days\": 3, \"friend\": [13, 15]},\n        \"Lyon\": {\"days\": 4},\n        \"Prague\": {\"days\": 3},\n        \"Paris\": {\"days\": 4},\n        \"Nice\": {\"days\": 4},\n        \"Seville\": {\"days\": 5, \"show\": [5, 9]},\n        \"Tallinn\": {\"days\": 2},\n        \"Mykonos\": {\"days\": 5, \"wedding\": [21, 25]},\n        \"Lisbon\": {\"days\": 2}\n    }\n\n    flights = {\n        \"Valencia\": [\"Paris\"],\n        \"Paris\": [\"Seville\", \"Nice\", \"Tallinn\", \"Lisbon\"],\n        \"Seville\": [\"Nice\"],\n        \"Nice\": [\"Mykonos\"],\n        \"Mykonos\": [\"Lisbon\"],\n        \"Tallinn\": [\"Paris\"],\n        \"Lisbon\": [\"Paris\"],\n        \"Oslo\": [\"Nice\"]\n    }\n\n    itinerary = []\n\n    current_city = \"Valencia\"\n    current_day = 1\n\n    # Day 1-2: Valencia (friends)\n    itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"})\n\n    # Fly to Paris on day 2\n    if current_day == 2:\n        next_city = \"Paris\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 2-2\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 2\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 3-7: Paris\n    if current_day >= 3 and current_city == \"Paris\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"})\n\n    # Fly to Seville on day 7\n    if current_day == 7:\n        next_city = \"Seville\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 7-7\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 7\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 8-14: Seville (show)\n    if current_day >= 8 and current_city == \"Seville\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 8-14\", \"place\": \"Seville\"})\n\n    # Fly to Nice on day 14\n    if current_day == 14:\n        next_city = \"Nice\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 14-14\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 14\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 15-19: Nice\n    if current_day >= 15 and current_city == \"Nice\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 15-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"})\n\n    # Fly to Mykonos on day 19\n    if current_day == 19:\n        next_city = \"Mykonos\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 19-19\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 19\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 20-24: Mykonos (wedding)\n    if current_day >= 20 and current_city == \"Mykonos\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 20-24\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"})\n\n    # Fly to Tallinn on day 24\n    if current_day == 24:\n        next_city = \"Tallinn\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 24-24\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 24\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 25: Tallinn\n    if current_day >= 25 and current_city == \"Tallinn\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 25-25\", \"place\": \"Tallinn\"})\n\n    # Convert to JSON\n    return json.dumps(itinerary)\n\ncompute_itinerary()\n```",
