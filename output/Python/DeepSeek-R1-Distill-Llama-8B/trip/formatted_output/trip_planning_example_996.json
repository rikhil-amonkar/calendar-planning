            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to create an optimal 22-day trip visiting 7 European cities. The constraints include attending a wedding in Mykonos, visiting relatives in Prague, and spending time in various other cities. I need to make sure that each city is visited for the required number of days and that flights between cities happen on the correct days.\n\nFirst, I'll start by defining the cities and their required stays. I'll include the start and end days for each city. Then, I'll outline the direct flights available between the cities based on the provided information.\n\nNext, I'll use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible sequences of city visits. For each permutation of cities, I'll check if the trip can fit within the 22-day window, respecting flight connections and day ranges. This means ensuring that each flight happens on the correct day and that the next city's visit starts on the day after the flight.\n\nI'll also need to handle constraints specifically. For example, the wedding in Mykonos must be attended between days 1 and 3, so I'll ensure that Mykonos is visited during that timeframe. Similarly, the visit to Prague for relatives must happen between days 7 and 9.\n\nAs I build the itinerary, I'll make sure that transitions between cities respect the flight availability and day constraints. If a flight isn't available on the required day or the next city's visit can't fit within the remaining days, I'll backtrack and try a different sequence.\n\nFinally, once a valid itinerary is found that satisfies all constraints, I'll return it as a JSON-formatted dictionary. This ensures that the trip plan is both optimal and adheres to all the given requirements.\n\nI realize that this approach might take some time to process, especially with the large number of cities and permutations, but it's necessary to ensure that all constraints are met and the trip is as efficient as possible.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create an optimal 22-day trip visiting 7 European cities while adhering to specific constraints such as attending a wedding, visiting friends, and relatives. The goal is to visit each city for a specified number of days and use direct flights between cities.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Cities and Stays**: List out the cities to be visited, including the number of days to stay in each, and any specific date constraints for events.\n2. **Flight Connections**: Identify the direct flights available between the cities to form a graph of possible transitions.\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use a backtracking approach to explore possible sequences of city visits, ensuring that each transition between cities respects the flight availability and day ranges.\n4. **Constraint Handling**: Ensure that specific events (wedding, family visit) are attended within their respective timeframes by checking each potential itinerary against these constraints.\n5. **Itinerary Construction**: Build the itinerary by starting from each city and exploring all possible next cities, ensuring that each transition respects the day ranges and constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the cities and their required stays\ncities = {\n    'Mykonos': {'days': 3, 'start_day': 1, 'end_day': 3},\n    'Valencia': {'days': 5, 'start_day': 4, 'end_day': 8},\n    'Riga': {'days': 5, 'start_day': 9, 'end_day': 13},\n    'Prague': {'days': 3, 'start_day': 14, 'end_day': 16},\n    'Zurich': {'days': 5, 'start_day': 17, 'end_day': 21},\n    'Bucharest': {'days': 5, 'start_day': 22, 'end_day': 26},\n    'Nice': {'days': 2, 'start_day': 27, 'end_day': 28}\n}\n\n# Flight connections\nflights = {\n    'Mykonos': ['Nice', 'Zurich'],\n    'Nice': ['Mykonos'],\n    'Zurich': ['Riga', 'Prague', 'Bucharest', 'Valencia'],\n    'Riga': ['Zurich', 'Bucharest'],\n    'Prague': ['Riga', 'Valencia'],\n    'Valencia': ['Zurich', 'Bucharest'],\n    'Bucharest': ['Riga', 'Prague'],\n    'Zurich': ['Prague']\n}\n\n# Algorithm to find the optimal itinerary\ndef find_optimal_itinerary(cities, flights, total_days=22):\n    # Initialize the itinerary\n    itinerary = []\n    current_city = None\n    current_start_day = 1\n    current_end_day = 1\n\n    # Try all possible orders of cities\n    for city_order in permutations(cities.keys()):\n        # Check if the order is feasible\n        itinerary = []\n        current_city = None\n        day = 1\n        possible = True\n        for city in city_order:\n            if current_city is None:\n                # First city\n                start_day = max(cities[city]['start_day'], day)\n                end_day = start_day + cities[city]['days'] -

For each permutation of cities, the algorithm checks if the trip can fit within the 22-day window while respecting flight connections and constraints. The constraints ensure that the wedding in Mykonos and the family visit in Prague are attended within their respective timeframes. The first valid itinerary found is returned as a JSON-formatted dictionary, ensuring all requirements are met.",
