They have specific constraints like attending a wedding in Berlin and meeting friends in Dublin. Plus, they want to take direct flights only.\n\nFirst, I'll start by defining each city's duration and any constraints. For example, Dublin needs 3 days, and the friend meeting is between days 7-9. Berlin has a 5-day stay with a wedding between days 3-7. I'll make sure each city has its duration and the specific days when events happen.\n\nNext, I'll outline the flight connections based on the provided list. Flights are direct, so I'll create a dictionary mapping each city to the cities it can fly to directly. This will help in planning the transitions between cities.\n\nNow, constructing the itinerary. I'll start with the earliest constraint, which is arriving in Berlin by day 3. From there, I'll plan the next city based on available flights and the duration needed. For instance, from Berlin, they can fly to Oslo, which fits the 3-day stay without conflicting with the wedding dates.\n\nI need to ensure that each flight transition happens on the same day as the departure and arrival. So, if they leave Berlin on day 7, they arrive in Oslo on day 7, and their stay there starts on day 7 and ends on day 9.\n\nI also need to handle the friend meeting in Dublin. Since they're in Oslo from day 7-9, I'll schedule a flight to Dublin on day 9, arriving on day 9, and staying for 3 days. This way, the friend meeting can happen on days 10-12.\n\nAfter Dublin, the next stop is Madrid, which has a 2-day stay with family. I'll fly from Dublin to Madrid on day 12, arrive on day 12, and stay until day 13.\n\nFinally, the program should output this itinerary in JSON format, making it clear and easy to follow. I'll make sure each entry in the itinerary includes the day range, the place, and any flights taken.\n\nI should also check if all cities are visited and all constraints are met. For example, making sure that they attend the wedding in Berlin between days 3-7 and meet friends in Dublin between days 10-12. Also, ensuring that the total duration doesn't exceed 13 days.\n\nI think the current approach covers all these aspects, but I'll need to make sure the dates align correctly and that each transition is valid based on the flight connections provided.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Define the cities with their duration and constraints\ncities = {\n    'Dublin': {'duration': 3, 'days': [7, 8, 9]},\n    'Berlin': {'duration': 5, 'days': [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]},\n    'Oslo': {'duration': 3, 'days': []},\n    'Madrid': {'duration': 2, 'days': [2, 3]},\n    'London': {'duration': 2, 'days': []},\n    'Vilnius': {'duration': 3, 'days': []}\n}\n\n# Flight connections as a dictionary\nflights = {\n    'Berlin': ['Oslo', 'Madrid'],\n    'Oslo': ['Berlin', 'Vilnius'],\n    'Vilnius': ['London'],\n    'London': ['Dublin'],\n    'Dublin': ['Madrid'],\n    'Madrid': ['Berlin']\n}\n\n# Generate the itinerary\nitinerary = []\n\ncurrent_city = None\ncurrent_day = None\n\n# Start with Berlin\nitinerary.append({'day_range': 'Day 1-7', 'place': 'Berlin'})\ncurrent_day = 7\ncurrent_city = 'Berlin'\n\n# Fly to Oslo\nitinerary.append({'flying': 'Day 7-7', 'from': 'Berlin', 'to': 'Oslo'})\ncurrent_day += 1\ncurrent_city = 'Oslo'\nitinerary.append({'day_range': 'Day 8-10', 'place': 'Oslo'})\n\n# Fly to Vilnius\nitinerary.append({'flying': 'Day 10-10', 'from': 'Oslo', 'to': 'Vilnius'})\ncurrent_day += 1\ncurrent_city = 'Vilnius'\nitinerary.append({'day_range': 'Day 11-13', 'place': 'Vilnius'})\n\n# Fly to London\nitinerary.append({'flying': 'Day 13-13', 'from': 'Vilnius', 'to': 'London'})\ncurrent_day += 1\ncurrent_city = 'London'\nitinerary.append({'day_range': 'Day 14-15', 'place': 'London'})\n\n# Fly to Dublin\nitinerary.append({'flying': 'Day 15-15', 'from': 'London', 'to': 'Dublin'})\ncurrent_day += 1\ncurrent_city = 'Dublin'\nitinerary.append({'day_range': 'Day 16-18', 'place': 'Dublin'})\n\n# Fly to Madrid\nitinerary.append({'flying': 'Day 18-18', 'from': 'Dublin', 'to': 'Madrid'})\ncurrent_day += 1\ncurrent_city = 'Madrid'\nitinerary.append({'day_range': 'Day 19-20', 'place': 'Madrid'})\n\n# Ensure all cities are visited and constraints met\n# This is a simplified approach, the actual code may require more sophisticated logic\n# The provided code is a placeholder and may need adjustments based on the constraints\n\n# Output the itinerary in JSON format\nprint(json.dumps(itinerary))\n```",
