            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create an optimal 28-day itinerary visiting 10 European cities based on the given constraints. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input parameters. There are several cities with specified day stays, some events that must happen within certain day ranges, and a list of direct flights between cities. My goal is to construct a trip that starts from a city, moves through all required cities, respects the day ranges, and attends any events or meetings specified.\n\nLooking at the constraints, I see that I must spend 5 days in Prague, 3 days in Tallinn, 2 days in Warsaw, 3 days in Porto, 5 days in Naples, 3 days in Milan, 5 days in Lisbon, 5 days in Santorini, 4 days in Riga, and 2 days in Stockholm. Additionally, there are specific flight connections between these cities.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from a city that allows the most flexibility. Considering the flight connections, starting from Riga might be a good choice because it connects to several other cities like Tallinn, Stockholm, and Warsaw. \n\nNext, I need to plan the trip day by day, ensuring that each transition between cities happens on the same day. For example, if the last day in one city is day 5, the flight and the first day in the next city should also be day 5.\n\nI'll begin by mapping out the required stays and ensuring that all events fall within their specified day ranges. For instance, the wedding in Tallinn should be between day 18 and 20. I'll need to plan the visit to Tallinn around these days, ensuring that the stay aligns with the event.\n\nI also need to handle the annual shows in Riga from day 5 to 8. This means Riga should be visited during this period, and I'll plan the 4-day stay in Riga around this event.\n\nConsidering the flight connections, I'll make sure that each move between cities uses direct flights as specified. For example, moving from Riga to Tallinn is possible, and from Tallinn to Prague.\n\nI should also check for any city that doesn't have direct flights and see if an indirect route is possible, but the problem specifies only direct flights. So, I'll need to ensure that all cities are connected directly according to the provided flight list.\n\nFinally, I'll construct the itinerary step by step, ensuring that each segment starts and ends on the correct day, and that all constraints are met. I'll also make sure that the total duration is 28 days, covering all required stays and transitions without overlapping or exceeding the days.\n\nAfter planning each segment, I'll verify the day transitions and ensure that all events and required stays are included. This comprehensive approach should result in a valid and optimal itinerary.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Read the input parameters and flight connections\ncities = {\n    \"Prague\": 5,\n    \"Tallinn\": 3,\n    \"Warsaw\": 2,\n    \"Porto\": 3,\n    \"Naples\": 5,\n    \"Milan\": 3,\n    \"Lisbon\": 5,\n    \"Santorini\": 5,\n    \"Riga\": 4,\n    \"Stockholm\": 2\n}\n\nflights = {\n    \"Riga\": [\"Tallinn\", \"Stockholm\", \"Warsaw\"],\n    \"Tallinn\": [\"Prague\"],\n    \"Warsaw\": [\"Porto\"],\n    \"Porto\": [\"Lisbon\"],\n    \"Lisbon\": [\"Naples\", \"Milan\"],\n    \"Naples\": [\"Warsaw\"],\n    \"Milan\": [\"Lisbon\", \"Santorini\"],\n    \"Santorini\": [\"Milan\"],\n    \"Riga\": [\"Prague\"],\n    \"Stockholm\": [\"Prague\", \"Tallinn\"],\n    \"Prague\": [\"Riga\", \"Tallinn\", \"Warsaw\"]\n}\n\n# Itinerary construction\nitinerary = []\n\n# Starting city\ncurrent_city = \"Riga\"\ncurrent_day = 1\nitinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {current_day}-{current_day + cities[current_city] -
