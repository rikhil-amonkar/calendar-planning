            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to solve this trip planning problem. Let's see, the user wants an optimal 25-day itinerary visiting 10 cities with specific constraints. They've provided a list of direct flights, so I'll need to use that to plan the route.\n\nFirst, I'll start by identifying the constraints for each city. For example, they have to stay in Warsaw for 4 days, Venice for 3, Vilnius for 3, Salzburg for 4, Amsterdam for 2, Barcelona for 5, Paris for 2, Hamburg for 4, Florence for 5, and Tallinn for 2 days. Also, there are specific meeting times in Barcelona, Salzburg, and Tallinn.\n\nNext, I'll map out the direct flights. This will help me determine which cities can be reached from each other on the same day. I'll list all possible direct flights based on the provided information.\n\nNow, I'll start constructing the itinerary. I'll begin in Paris since it's mentioned first and has an initial workshop to attend. From Paris, I can fly to several cities, but considering the show in Paris ends on day 2, I'll plan the next flight from there.\n\nI need to ensure that each city's stay aligns with the required duration and that transitions happen on the same day. For example, if the last day in Paris is day 2, the flight to the next city should be on day 2, and the stay should start on day 2.\n\nI'll also need to handle the meetings and events within the specified days. For instance, the wedding in Salzburg is between day 22 and 25, so I'll plan the visit around those days, ensuring enough time is allocated.\n\nAs I build the itinerary, I'll check each day to make sure the transitions are correct and that all constraints are met. If I encounter a conflict, I'll adjust the flight days accordingly.\n\nFinally, I'll format the itinerary as a JSON object, ensuring each segment is properly structured with day ranges, flying details, and place information.\n\nAfter constructing the itinerary, I'll run it through the code to ensure it's valid and outputs correctly. This way, the user gets a complete and accurate plan for their trip.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef compute_itinerary():\n    cities = {\n        \"Paris\": {\"days\": 2, \"workshop\": [1, 2]},\n        \"Warsaw\": {\"days\": 4},\n        \"Venice\": {\"days\": 3},\n        \"Vilnius\": {\"days\": 3},\n        \"Salzburg\": {\"days\": 4, \"wedding\": [22, 25]},\n        \"Amsterdam\": {\"days\": 2},\n        \"Barcelona\": {\"days\": 5, \"tour\": [2, 6]},\n        \"Hamburg\": {\"days\": 4, \"conference\": [19, 22]},\n        \"Florence\": {\"days\": 5},\n        \"Tallinn\": {\"days\": 2, \"friend\": [11, 12]}\n    }\n\n    flights = {\n        \"Paris\": [\"Warsaw\", \"Amsterdam\", \"Vilnius\", \"Barcelona\"],\n        \"Warsaw\": [\"Paris\", \"Venice\", \"Vilnius\"],\n        \"Venice\": [\"Warsaw\", \"Hamburg\"],\n        \"Vilnius\": [\"Warsaw\", \"Paris\"],\n        \"Barcelona\": [\"Warsaw\", \"Amsterdam\", \"Hamburg\", \"Florence\"],\n        \"Amsterdam\": [\"Paris\", \"Warsaw\", \"Vilnius\", \"Tallinn\"],\n        \"Hamburg\": [\"Florence\", \"Salzburg\"],\n        \"Florence\": [\"Hamburg\", \"Barcelona\"],\n        \"Tallinn\": [\"Warsaw\", \"Vilnius\"],\n        \"Salzburg\": [\"Hamburg\"]\n    }\n\n    itinerary = []\n\n    current_city = \"Paris\"\n    current_day = 1\n\n    # Day 1-2: Paris (workshop)\n    itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Paris\"})\n\n    # Fly to Barcelona on day 2\n    if current_day == 2:\n        next_city = \"Barcelona\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 2-2\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 2\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 3-7: Barcelona (tour)\n    if current_day >= 3 and current_city == \"Barcelona\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"})\n\n    # Fly to Warsaw on day 7\n    if current_day == 7:\n        next_city = \"Warsaw\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 7-7\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 7\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 8-11: Warsaw\n    if current_day >= 8 and current_city == \"Warsaw\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"})\n\n    # Fly to Venice on day 11\n    if current_day == 11:\n        next_city = \"Venice\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 11-11\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 11\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 12-14: Venice\n    if current_day >= 12 and current_city == \"Venice\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 12-14\", \"place\": \"Venice\"})\n\n    # Fly to Vilnius on day 14\n    if current_day == 14:\n        next_city = \"Vilnius\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 14-14\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 14\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 15-17: Vilnius\n    if current_day >= 15 and current_city == \"Vilnius\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 15-17\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"})\n\n    # Fly to Hamburg on day 17\n    if current_day == 17:\n        next_city = \"Hamburg\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 17-17\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 17\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 18-21: Hamburg (conference)\n    if current_day >= 18 and current_city == \"Hamburg\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 18-21\", \"place\": \"Hamburg\"})\n\n    # Fly to Salzburg on day 21\n    if current_day == 21:\n        next_city = \"Salzburg\"\n        if next_city in flights.get(current_city, []):\n            itinerary.append({\"flying\": \"Day 21-21\", \"from\": current_city, \"to\": next_city})\n            current_day = 21\n            current_city = next_city\n\n    # Days 22-25: Salzburg (wedding)\n    if current_day >= 22 and current_city == \"Salzburg\":\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": \"Day 22-25\", \"place\": \"Salzburg\"})\n\n    return json.dumps(itinerary)\n\ncompute_itinerary()\n```",
