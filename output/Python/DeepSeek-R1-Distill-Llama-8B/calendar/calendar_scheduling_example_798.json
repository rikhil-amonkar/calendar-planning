They want to meet as early as possible, so the earliest availability.\n\nFirst, I need to look at Nancy's schedule. She's busy on Monday from 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. So, she has some gaps in between these busy times. On Tuesday, she's busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, and 15:30 to 16:00. On Wednesday, she's busy from 10:00 to 11:30 and 13:30 to 16:00.\n\nJose is busy every day from 9:00 to 17:00 except for Wednesday, where he's free from 9:30 to 10:00 and from 12:30 to 13:30. So, Jose is almost always busy on Monday and Tuesday, but has some small free slots on Wednesday.\n\nSince they want to meet as early as possible, I should check each day starting from Monday, then Tuesday, and then Wednesday.\n\nOn Monday, Nancy has a free slot from 9:00 to 10:00, but Jose is busy the entire day, so that won't work. Next, Nancy is busy from 10:00 to 10:30, but that's when Jose is busy too. Then, she's free from 11:30 to 12:30, but Jose is busy then as well. After that, she's busy again until 14:00. So, Monday doesn't seem to work.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nancy is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, so the earliest she's free is at 10:30. Jose is busy the entire day on Tuesday, so that doesn't help. So, Tuesday doesn't work either.\n\nNow, looking at Wednesday. Nancy is busy from 10:00 to 11:30 and then from 13:30 to 16:00. Jose is free from 9:30 to 10:00 and from 12:30 to 13:30. So, the earliest possible time they can meet is right after Jose becomes free at 9:30, but Nancy isn't free until 10:00. The next available slot is after 10:30, but Jose is busy until 12:30. Then, Nancy is free from 12:30 to 13:30, but Jose is busy until 13:30. Finally, after 13:30, Nancy is busy again, so the only possible slot is after 16:00, but Jose is busy until 17:00.\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense. There must be a slot where both are free. Maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nJose has a free slot from 9:30 to 10:00 on Wednesday. Nancy is free from 9:00 to 10:00, but she's busy from 10:00 onward. So, the only overlap is at 9:30, but that's when Jose is free, but Nancy is busy until 10:00. So, the next possible time is after Nancy becomes free at 10:00, but Jose is busy until 12:30. Then, Nancy is free from 12:30 to 13:30, but Jose is busy until 13:30. After that, Nancy is busy again until 16:00, and Jose is busy until 17:00.\n\nHmm, it seems like there's no slot where both are free. But the problem statement says there is a solution. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. Perhaps I should consider that Jose is busy from 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday, he has some free time. Nancy has some free slots on Wednesday after 16:00, but Jose is busy until 17:00. So, the latest possible time is 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nWait, but Nancy is busy from 13:30 to 16:00 on Wednesday, so she's free from 16:00 to 17:00. Jose is free from 12:30 to 13:30 and 16:00 to 17:00. So, the latest possible time is 16:00 to 16:30. That should work.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled at 16:00 on Wednesday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Nancy's busy periods\n    nancy_busy = [\n        (10 * 60, 10 * 60 + 30),   # 10:00-10:30\n        (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60),  # 11:30-12:30\n        (13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60),  # 13:30-14:00\n        (14 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30),  # 14:30-15:30\n        (16 * 60, 17 * 60)        # 16:00-17:00\n    ]\n    nancy_busy_tuesday = [\n        (9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60),    # 9:30-10:00\n        (11 * 60, 11 * 60 + 30),   # 11:00-11:30\n        (12 * 60, 12 * 60 + 30),   # 12:00-12:30\n        (13 * 60, 13 * 60 + 30),   # 13:00-13:30\n        (15 * 60, 16 * 60)         # 15:30-16:00\n    ]\n    nancy_busy_wednesday = [\n        (10 * 60, 11 * 60 + 30),   # 10:00-11:30\n        (13 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60)    # 13:30-16:00\n    ]\n\n    # Jose's busy periods\n    jose_busy = [\n        (9 * 60, 17 * 60)          # 9:00-17:00 (Monday)\n    ]\n    jose_busy_tuesday = [\n        (9 * 60, 17 * 60)          # 9:00-17:00 (Tuesday)\n    ]\n    jose_busy_wednesday = [\n        (9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30),      # 9:30-10:00\n        (12 * 60, 13 * 60),        # 12:30-13:30\n        (15 * 60, 17 * 60)         # 15:00-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Function to check if time is free for a person\n    def is_free(person_busy, start, end):\n        for b in person_busy:\n            if (b[0] <= start < b[1]) or (b[0] <= end - 1 < b[1]):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Check each day starting from Monday\n    for day in ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']:\n        if day == 'Monday':\n            nancy_free = []\n            for slot in range(work_start, work_end + 1, 60):\n                slot_start = slot\n                slot_end = slot + meeting_duration\n                if slot_end > work_end:\n                    slot_end = work_end\n                if is_free(nancy_busy, slot_start, slot_end):\n                    nancy_free.append((slot_start, slot_end))\n            if not nancy_free:\n                continue\n\n            for n_slot in nancy_free:\n                if is_free(jose_busy, n_slot[0], n_slot[1]):\n                    return f\"{n_slot[0]:02d}:{n_slot[1]:02d}:{day}\"\n\n        elif day == 'Tuesday':\n            nancy_free = []\n            for slot in range(work_start, work_end + 1, 60):\n                slot_start = slot\n                slot_end = slot + meeting_duration\n                if slot_end > work_end:\n                    slot_end = work_end\n                if is_free(nancy_busy_tuesday, slot_start, slot_end):\n                    nancy_free.append((slot_start, slot_end))\n            if not nancy_free:\n                continue\n\n            for n_slot in nancy_free:\n                if is_free(jose_busy_tuesday, n_slot[0], n_slot[1]):\n                    return f\"{n_slot[0]:02d}:{n_slot[1]:02d}:{day}\"\n\n        elif day == 'Wednesday':\n            nancy_free = []\n            for slot in range(work_start, work_end + 1, 60):\n                slot_start = slot\n                slot_end = slot + meeting_duration\n                if slot_end > work_end:\n                    slot_end = work_end\n                if is_free(nancy_busy_wednesday, slot_start, slot_end):\n                    nancy_free.append((slot_start, slot_end))\n            if not nancy_free:\n                continue\n\n            for n_slot in nancy_free:\n                if is_free(jose_busy_wednesday, n_slot[0], n_slot[1]):\n                    return f\"{n_slot[0]:02d}:{n_slot[1]:02d}:{day}\"\n\n    return None\n\n# Run the function and print the result\nresult = find_meeting_time()\nif result:\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(\"No suitable time found\")\n```",
