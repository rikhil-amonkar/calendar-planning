            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Ryan, Ruth, and Denise on Monday. The meeting should last one hour between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. Let's see what each person's schedule looks like.\n\nFirst, Ryan is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 AM and again from 12:30 to 1:00 PM. That means he's unavailable during those times. Ruth, on the other hand, has no meetings all day, so she's completely free. Denise has a blocked time from 9:30 to 10:30 AM, 12:00 to 1:00 PM, and 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM. She doesn't want to meet after 12:30 PM.\n\nSo, I need to find a one-hour slot that works for everyone. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Ryan's Busy Times:**\n   - 9:00-9:30 AM\n   - 12:30-1:00 PM\n\n2. **Denise's Blocked Times:**\n   - 9:30-10:30 AM\n   - 12:00-1:00 PM\n   - 2:30-4:30 PM\n\n3. **Ruth's Availability:**\n   - Entire day is free.\n\nSince the meeting has to be one hour, I'll look for a slot that doesn't overlap with anyone's busy times and fits within the work hours.\n\nLet's consider the time slots between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM:\n\n- **Morning Slot:**\n  - Before 9:30 AM: 9:00-9:30 is Ryan's meeting, so that's out.\n  - Between 9:30 AM and 10:30 AM: Denise is blocked until 10:30 AM. So, 10:00-11:00 AM might be available if we start at 10:00 AM.\n\n- **Mid-Morning Slot:**\n  - Between 10:30 AM and 12:00 PM: Ryan is free from 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM, but Denise is busy from 12:00 PM onwards. So, maybe 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM?\n\n- **Afternoon Slot:**\n  - After 12:30 PM: Ryan is free, but Denise is blocked until 2:30 PM. So, 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM might be a possibility.\n\n- **Evening Slot:**\n  - Between 4:30 PM and 5:00 PM: This seems too late since the meeting needs to be at least one hour, but let's check if it fits.\n\nNow, considering all these, the best possible slot seems to be between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Ryan is free after 9:30 AM, and Denise is free from 10:30 AM onwards, but we can start at 10:00 AM and end at 11:00 AM, which doesn't overlap with anyone's busy times.\n\nAnother option is between 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM. Ryan is free, and Denise is blocked until 4:30 PM, so this should work.\n\nI need to choose the earliest possible slot, so 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM seems better.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\n- **10:00 AM to 11:00 AM:**\n  - Ryan is free (he's busy until 9:30 AM and then again at 12:30 PM).\n  - Ruth is free.\n  - Denise is free from 10:30 AM onwards, so 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM is okay.\n\n- **2:30 PM to 3:30 PM:**\n  - Ryan is free.\n  - Ruth is free.\n  - Denise is blocked until 4:30 PM, so 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM is okay.\n\nBetween these two, 10:00 AM is earlier, so that's the best option.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    # Define the work hours for the day (Monday)\n    work_hours = [(9, 0), (17, 0)]  # (start hour, start minute), (end hour, end minute)\n\n    # Define the working day in minutes\n    work_day = 17 * 60 - 9 * 60  # 480 minutes (8 hours)\n\n    # Define the blocked times for each participant\n    ryan_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30),  # 9:00-9:30 AM\n        (12, 30), (13, 0)  # 12:30-1:00 PM\n    ]\n    ruth_blocked = []\n    denise_blocked = [\n        (9, 30), (10, 30),  # 9:30-10:30 AM\n        (12, 0), (13, 0),  # 12:00-1:00 PM\n        (14, 30), (16, 30)  # 2:30-4:30 PM\n    ]\n\n    # Convert blocked times to minutes for easier comparison\n    ryan_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in ryan_blocked]\n    ruth_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in ruth_blocked]\n    denise_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in denise_blocked]\n\n    # Function to check if a time is blocked by a participant\n    def is_blocked(start, end, participant):\n        # Convert start and end to minutes\n        start_min = start * 60\n        end_min = end * 60\n        # Check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n        for block_start, block_end in participant:\n            if (start_min < block_end and end_min > block_start):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible start times within work hours\n    for start_h in range(9, 17):\n        for start_m in range(0, 60):\n            start_min = start_h * 60 + start_m\n            end_min = start_min + duration\n            if end_min > 17 * 60:\n                continue  # End after work hours\n\n            # Check if this time slot is free for everyone\n            if not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, ryan_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, ruth_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, denise_blocked):\n                print(f\"{start_h:02}:{start_m:02}-{start_h:02}:{end_min//60:02}\")\n                print(\"Monday\")\n                return\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No available slot found\")\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
