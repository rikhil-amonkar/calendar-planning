            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help find a suitable time for Julie and Ruth to have a meeting that lasts half an hour. The meeting should be between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on any of the days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. \n\nFirst, I'll look at Julie's schedule. She has no meetings all week, so her entire week is free. That means she's available any time between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on any day.\n\nNext, I'll check Ruth's schedule. She's busy on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. On Thursday, she has some specific busy times: from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, from 11:30 AM to 2:30 PM, and from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. So, Ruth is busy during those periods on Thursday but free during 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM.\n\nNow, Julie wants to avoid meetings on Thursday before 11:30 AM. That means if we choose a time on Thursday, it should be after 11:30 AM to respect her preference.\n\nSince Julie is completely free and Ruth has specific busy periods, I need to find a 30-minute slot that fits within Ruth's free time on Thursday after 11:30 AM.\n\nLet me list out Ruth's free slots on Thursday:\n- 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM\n\nThat's the only free slot after 11:30 AM on Thursday. Is that enough? Well, it's only 30 minutes, which matches the meeting duration. So, 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM on Thursday seems to be the only possible time that works for both of them.\n\nWait, but the meeting needs to be 30 minutes. Ruth is free from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM, which is exactly 30 minutes. That fits perfectly.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM on Thursday.\n\nI should also check if there are any other possible times on other days. For example, on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, Ruth is fully busy from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Since Julie is free, but Ruth isn't, those days won't work.\n\nTherefore, the only suitable time is on Thursday from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(schedules, duration=\"30:00\"):\n    all_free = []\n    for person in schedules:\n        free_times = []\n        for time in person:\n            if time[1] == True:\n                free_times.append((time[0], time[1]))\n        all_free.append(free_times)\n    \n    day_start = datetime.time(9, 0)\n    day_end = datetime.time(17, 0)\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\"]\n    \n    for day in days:\n        current_day = day_start\n        while current_day <= day_end:\n            end_time = datetime.time((current_day.hour + duration[0]) % 24, (current_day.minute + duration[1]) % 60)\n            if end_time > day_end:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            conflict = False\n            for person in all_free:\n                for time in person:\n                    if time[0] <= current_day < time[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            for person in all_free:\n                for time in person:\n                    if time[0] <= end_time < time[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            return f\"{current_day.hour:02}:{current_day.minute:02}:{end_time.hour:02}:{end_time.minute:02} {day}\"\n            \n            current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n    \n    return \"No suitable time found\"\n\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time([\n    [ (datetime.time(9, 0), True) for _ in range(24*60) ],\n    [ (datetime.time(9, 0), True) for _ in range(24*60) ],\n    [ (datetime.time(9, 0), True) for _ in range(24*60) ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(9, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), False),\n        (datetime.time(11, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(14, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(15, 0), False),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), False),\n        (datetime.time(16, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(17, 0), False)\n    ]\n])\n```",
