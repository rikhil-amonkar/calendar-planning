            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to find a suitable time for Laura and Philip's meeting. Let me start by understanding their constraints and schedules.\n\nFirst, the meeting should last one hour and can be on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday during working hours of 9:00 to 17:00.\n\nLaura's schedule is blocked on:\n- Monday: 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n- Tuesday: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-17:00\n- Wednesday: 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 15:30-16:30\n- Thursday: 10:30-11:00, 12:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n\nPhilip's schedule is blocked on:\n- Monday: 9:00-17:00 (he's busy all day)\n- Tuesday: 9:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-16:30\n- Wednesday: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-12:00, 12:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n- Thursday: 9:00-10:30, 11:00-12:30, 13:00-17:00\n\nAdditionally, Philip cannot meet on Wednesday. So, the possible days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.\n\nLet me check each day:\n\nMonday:\nLaura is busy from 10:30-17:00. Since the meeting is one hour, possible times would be before 10:30 or after 17:00, but that's outside working hours. So no available time on Monday.\n\nTuesday:\nLaura is busy from 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-17:00. Let's look for gaps between these blocks.\n\nBetween 10:00-11:00: available.\nBetween 11:30-13:00: 45 minutes available.\nBetween 13:30-14:30: 1 hour available.\nBetween 15:00-16:00: available.\nBut wait, Laura is free from 10:00-11:00 and 13:30-14:30 and 15:00-16:00. However, Philip is busy on Tuesday from 9:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-16:30.\n\nSo possible times for Laura are 10:00-11:00, 13:30-14:30, and 15:00-16:00. But Philip is busy during 10:00-11:00 (he's free at 10:00?), wait, Philip is busy from 9:00-11:00, so he's available at 11:00. Wait, no, 9:00-11:00 is his busy time, so he's busy until 11:00. So Laura's 10:00-11:00 is during Philip's busy time. Therefore, that slot is not available.\n\nNext, Laura's 13:30-14:30. Philip is busy from 13:00-13:30 and 14:00-14:30. So 13:30-14:00 is available for Laura, but the meeting is one hour. If they start at 13:30, the meeting would end at 14:30, which is when Philip is busy. So that won't work. Alternatively, if they start at 13:30, but Philip is busy until 14:00, so maybe they can't meet then.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check.\n\nLaura's available times on Tuesday are 10:00-11:00, 13:30-14:30, and 15:00-16:00.\n\nPhilip's busy times on Tuesday are 9:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-16:30.\n\nSo, possible overlap is:\n\n- 10:00-11:00: Laura is available, but Philip is busy until 11:00. So no.\n- 13:30-14:30: Laura is available, but Philip is busy from 13:00-13:30 and 14:00-14:30. So the meeting can't start before 13:30, but ending at 14:30 would conflict with Philip's meeting. So no.\n- 15:00-16:00: Laura is available, but Philip is busy until 16:30. So meeting can start at 15:00, but then Philip is busy from 15:00-16:30. So the meeting would end at 16:00, which is before Philip's meeting ends. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but Laura's meeting ends at 16:00, and Philip is busy until 16:30. So the meeting from 15:00-16:00 would work because it ends before Philip's next meeting. So that's a possible slot.\n\nNow, let's check Thursday.\n\nOn Thursday, Laura is busy from 10:30-11:00, 12:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nSo Laura's available times on Thursday are before 10:30 and after 16:30, but within working hours, that's only 9:00-10:30. But Philip is busy on Thursday from 9:00-10:30, 11:00-12:30, 13:00-17:00.\n\nSo Laura is available from 10:30-11:00 and 16:30-17:00, but let's see:\n\n- 10:30-11:00: Laura is available, but Philip is busy until 11:00. So no.\n- 16:30-17:00: Laura is available, but the meeting would start at 16:30, which is when Philip's meeting ends at 16:30. So they can start at 16:30, but that's the end time. So maybe 16:30-17:00 is possible.\n\nWait, but the meeting duration is one hour, so starting at 16:30 would end at 17:30, which is outside working hours. So that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only possible day is Tuesday at 15:00-16:00.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that on Tuesday, Laura is available from 15:00-16:00, and Philip is busy until 16:30. So the meeting can be scheduled from 15:00-16:00.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the meeting time is 15:00-16:00 on Tuesday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    work_hours = [(9, 17), (9, 17), (9, 17), (9, 17)]  # Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday\n    # Meeting duration\n    duration = 1\n    \n    # Available days based on Philip's constraints\n    available_days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday']\n    \n    # Check each day for possible meeting times\n    for day in available_days:\n        # Convert day to numerical value for easier comparison\n        day_num = {'Monday': 0, 'Tuesday': 1, 'Wednesday': 2, 'Thursday': 3}[day]\n        start_time = 9 * 60\n        end_time = 17 * 60\n        \n        # Create a list of all time slots for the day\n        time_slots = []\n        for hour in range(9, 17):\n            for minute in range(0, 60):\n                time_slots.append((hour * 60 + minute, hour * 60 + minute + duration))\n        \n        # Filter time slots based on blocked times\n        available_slots = []\n        for slot in time_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            # Check if the time slot is within working hours\n            if 9 * 60 <= time_start < 17 * 60 and 9 * 60 <= time_end < 17 * 60:\n                # Check if the slot is available for both participants\n                if is_available(day_num, slot):\n                    available_slots.append(slot)\n        \n        # Find the first available slot that works for both participants\n        for slot in available_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            print(f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d}:{time_end % 60:02d} {day}\")\n            return f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d} {day}\"\n    \n    # If no slot is found, return an error message\n    return \"No available time found.\"\n\ndef is_available(day_num, slot):\n    # Check Laura's schedule\n    blocked_times = {\n        0: [(10*60 + 30, 11*60), (12*60 + 30, 13*60), (14*60 + 30, 15*60), (16*60, 17*60)],\n        1: [(9*60 + 30, 10*60), (11*60, 11*60 + 30), (13*60, 13*60 + 30), (14*60 + 30, 15*60), (16*60, 17*60)],\n        2: [(11*60 + 30, 12*60), (12*60 + 30, 13*60), (15*60 + 30, 16*60), (17*60, 18*60)],  # Wednesday is blocked for Philip\n        3: [(10*60 + 30, 11*60), (12*60, 13*60 + 30), (15*60, 15*60 + 30), (16*60, 16*60 + 30)]\n    }\n    \n    if day_num in blocked_times:\n        for start, end in blocked_times[day_num]:\n            if start <= slot[0] < end:\n                return False\n    \n    # Check Philip's schedule\n    blocked_philip = {\n        0: [(9*60, 17*60)],  # Monday is fully blocked\n        1: [(9*60 + 30, 10*60), (11*60 + 30, 12*60), (13*60, 13*60 + 30), (14*60, 14*60 + 30), (15*60, 16*60 + 30)],\n        2: [(9*60, 10*60), (11*60, 12*60), (12*60 + 30, 16*60), (16*60 + 30, 17*60)],\n        3: [(9*60, 10*60 + 30), (11*60, 12*60 + 30), (13*60, 17*60)]\n    }\n    \n    if day_num in blocked_philip:\n        for start, end in blocked_philip[day_num]:\n            if start <= slot[0] < end:\n                return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
