            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for a group of people: Andrea, Ruth, Steven, Grace, Kyle, Elijah, and Lori. The meeting needs to be half an hour long between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on Monday. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each person's schedule to see when they're free. \n\nAndrea is busy from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM and from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM. So, she's free before 9:30 AM, between 10:30 AM and 1:30 PM, and after 2:30 PM.\n\nRuth has blocked her calendar from 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. That means she's free before 12:30 PM, between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM, and after 3:30 PM.\n\nSteven is busy during several overlapping times: 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, and 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM. So, his free times are before 10:00 AM, between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM, between 11:30 AM and 12:00 PM, between 12:30 PM and 1:30 PM, after 2:00 PM, and after 4:00 PM.\n\nGrace has no meetings the whole day, so she's completely free from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\n\nKyle is busy from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM, 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM, 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM. That leaves him free between 9:30 AM and 10:30 AM, between 12:00 PM and 12:30 PM, between 1:00 PM and 1:30 PM, after 3:00 PM, and after 4:00 PM.\n\nElijah has blocked his calendar from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM, 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM. So, he's free between 11:00 AM and 11:30 AM, between 1:00 PM and 1:30 PM, after 2:00 PM, and after 4:00 PM.\n\nLori is busy from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM, 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM, 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM. Therefore, she's free between 9:30 AM and 10:00 AM, between 11:30 AM and 12:00 PM, between 1:30 PM and 2:00 PM, and after 4:00 PM.\n\nNow, I need to find a half-hour window where all seven people are free. Let's go through the day hour by hour.\n\nFrom 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM:\n- Andrea is free until 9:30 AM.\n- Ruth is free until 12:30 PM.\n- Steven is free until 10:00 AM.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free until 10:30 AM.\n- Elijah is free until 11:00 AM.\n- Lori is free until 9:30 AM.\n\nSo, between 9:00 AM and 9:30 AM, only Lori is busy until 9:30 AM. So, the earliest possible time is 9:30 AM.\n\nAt 9:30 AM, Andrea starts her meeting, so she's busy. Lori also becomes free at 9:30 AM. So, the next available time is after 9:30 AM.\n\nBetween 9:30 AM and 10:00 AM:\n- Andrea is busy until 10:30 AM.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free until 10:00 AM.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free until 10:30 AM.\n- Elijah is free until 11:00 AM.\n- Lori is free from 9:30 AM.\n\nSo, at 9:30 AM, Andrea and Lori are free. Wait, no, Andrea is busy until 10:30 AM, so she's not free at 9:30 AM. Lori is free from 9:30 AM.\n\nSo, from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM, who is free? Let's see:\n\n- Andrea: busy until 10:30 AM.\n- Ruth: free.\n- Steven: free until 10:00 AM.\n- Grace: free.\n- Kyle: free until 10:30 AM.\n- Elijah: free until 11:00 AM.\n- Lori: free from 9:30 AM.\n\nSo, at 9:30 AM, only Lori is free. At 10:00 AM, Steven is busy again. So, between 9:30 AM and 10:00 AM, only Lori is free, but others are busy. So, we can't have a meeting here.\n\nNext, between 10:00 AM and 10:30 AM:\n- Andrea is busy until 10:30 AM.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is busy until 11:00 AM.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free until 10:30 AM.\n- Elijah is free until 11:00 AM.\n- Lori is free from 9:30 AM.\n\nSo, at 10:00 AM, Steven is busy. At 10:30 AM, Andrea and Kyle finish their meetings. So, from 10:30 AM onwards, let's check.\n\nAt 10:30 AM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free from 11:00 AM.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free.\n- Elijah is free until 11:00 AM.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, at 10:30 AM, everyone except Elijah is free until 11:00 AM. So, the next available time is after 11:00 AM.\n\nBetween 11:00 AM and 11:30 AM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free until 11:30 AM.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free.\n- Elijah is busy until 11:30 AM.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, at 11:00 AM, Elijah is busy until 11:30 AM. So, the meeting can't start before 11:30 AM.\n\nAt 11:30 AM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free.\n- Elijah is free.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, from 11:30 AM, everyone is free. Let's check if we can fit a half-hour meeting here.\n\n11:30 AM to 12:00 PM is 30 minutes. So, that works.\n\nBut wait, let's check if any of them have any other meetings overlapping.\n\nAndrea: She's free until 1:30 PM, so 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM is fine.\n\nRuth: She's free until 1:00 PM, so 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM is okay.\n\nSteven: He's free until 12:30 PM, so 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM is fine.\n\nGrace: She's free all day, so no problem.\n\nKyle: He's free until 12:00 PM, so 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM is okay.\n\nElijah: He's free from 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM, so 11:30 AM is when he's free.\n\nLori: She's free from 11:30 AM, so that's perfect.\n\nSo, 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM on Monday seems to work for everyone.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any other time that might work better?\n\nAfter 12:00 PM, let's see:\n\nAt 12:00 PM:\n- Andrea is free until 1:30 PM.\n- Ruth is free until 1:00 PM.\n- Steven is free until 12:30 PM.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free until 12:00 PM.\n- Elijah is free until 1:00 PM.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, at 12:00 PM, Steven is busy until 12:30 PM, and Ruth is busy until 1:00 PM. So, the next available time after 12:00 PM is 12:30 PM.\n\nAt 12:30 PM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is busy until 1:00 PM.\n- Steven is free.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free.\n- Elijah is free.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, from 12:30 PM, Ruth is busy until 1:00 PM. So, the meeting can't start before 1:00 PM.\n\nAt 1:00 PM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free.\n- Elijah is free.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, 1:00 PM is a possible start time. Let's check the duration: 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM. That's 30 minutes. \n\nBut wait, let's check if any of them have meetings during that time.\n\nAndrea: She's free until 1:30 PM, so 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM is okay.\n\nRuth: She's free until 1:00 PM, so she's available.\n\nSteven: He's free until 12:30 PM, but he's busy again from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM. So, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM is free.\n\nGrace: Free all day.\n\nKyle: He's free until 12:00 PM, but he's busy again from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM. So, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM is okay.\n\nElijah: He's free until 1:00 PM, so he's available.\n\nLori: She's free until 1:30 PM, so that's fine.\n\nSo, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM also works.\n\nBut we already have 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM as a possible time. So, which one is better? Maybe 11:30 AM is earlier, so that might be preferable.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if there are any other times.\n\nAfter 1:30 PM, let's see:\n\nAt 1:30 PM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is busy until 2:00 PM.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is busy until 3:00 PM.\n- Elijah is free.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, Steven and Kyle are busy until 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM, respectively. So, the next available time is after 2:00 PM.\n\nAt 2:00 PM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free.\n- Elijah is free.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, 2:00 PM is a possible start time. Let's check the duration: 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\nChecking each person:\n\nAndrea: Free until 1:30 PM, then free. So, 2:00 PM is okay.\n\nRuth: Free until 1:00 PM, then free. So, 2:00 PM is okay.\n\nSteven: Free until 12:30 PM, busy again from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, then free. So, 2:00 PM is okay.\n\nGrace: Free all day.\n\nKyle: Free until 12:00 PM, busy again from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, then free. So, 2:00 PM is okay.\n\nElijah: Free until 1:00 PM, then free. So, 2:00 PM is okay.\n\nLori: Free until 1:30 PM, then free. So, 2:00 PM is okay.\n\nSo, 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM also works.\n\nSimilarly, after 2:30 PM, let's see:\n\nAt 2:30 PM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is busy until 3:00 PM.\n- Elijah is free.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, Kyle is busy until 3:00 PM. So, the next available time is after 3:00 PM.\n\nAt 3:00 PM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free.\n- Elijah is free.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, 3:00 PM is a possible start time. Let's check the duration: 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM.\n\nChecking each person:\n\nAndrea: Free until 1:30 PM, then free. So, 3:00 PM is okay.\n\nRuth: Free until 1:00 PM, then free. So, 3:00 PM is okay.\n\nSteven: Free until 12:30 PM, busy again from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, then free. So, 3:00 PM is okay.\n\nGrace: Free all day.\n\nKyle: Free until 12:00 PM, busy again from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, then free. So, 3:00 PM is okay.\n\nElijah: Free until 1:00 PM, then free. So, 3:00 PM is okay.\n\nLori: Free until 1:30 PM, then free. So, 3:00 PM is okay.\n\nSo, 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM also works.\n\nSimilarly, after 3:30 PM:\n\nAt 3:30 PM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free.\n- Elijah is busy until 4:00 PM.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, Elijah is busy until 4:00 PM. So, the next available time is after 4:00 PM.\n\nAt 4:00 PM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free.\n- Elijah is free.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, 4:00 PM is a possible start time. Let's check the duration: 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n\nChecking each person:\n\nAndrea: Free until 1:30 PM, then free. So, 4:00 PM is okay.\n\nRuth: Free until 1:00 PM, then free. So, 4:00 PM is okay.\n\nSteven: Free until 12:30 PM, busy again from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, then free. So, 4:00 PM is okay.\n\nGrace: Free all day.\n\nKyle: Free until 12:00 PM, busy again from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, then free. So, 4:00 PM is okay.\n\nElijah: Free until 1:00 PM, then busy until 4:00 PM, so he's busy at 4:00 PM. So, he's not free.\n\nLori: Free until 1:30 PM, then free. So, 4:00 PM is okay.\n\nSo, Elijah is busy until 4:00 PM, so the meeting can't start at 4:00 PM. The next available time is after 4:00 PM.\n\nAt 4:00 PM, Elijah is busy until 4:00 PM. So, the meeting can't start at 4:00 PM.\n\nWait, Elijah's schedule says he's blocked from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So, at 4:00 PM, he's free. So, the meeting can start at 4:00 PM.\n\nWait, no, the meeting duration is 30 minutes. So, if we start at 4:00 PM, the meeting ends at 4:30 PM.\n\nBut Elijah is busy until 4:00 PM, so he can join the meeting at 4:00 PM. So, 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM is acceptable.\n\nSo, 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM also works.\n\nBut let's check if there are any other times.\n\nAfter 4:30 PM:\n\nAt 4:30 PM:\n- Andrea is free.\n- Ruth is free.\n- Steven is free.\n- Grace is free.\n- Kyle is free.\n- Elijah is free.\n- Lori is free.\n\nSo, 4:30 PM is a possible start time. Let's check the duration: 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nChecking each person:\n\nAndrea: Free until 1:30 PM, then free. So, 4:30 PM is okay.\n\nRuth: Free until 1:00 PM, then free. So, 4:30 PM is okay.\n\nSteven: Free until 12:30 PM, busy again from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, then free. So, 4:30 PM is okay.\n\nGrace: Free all day.\n\nKyle: Free until 12:00 PM, busy again from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, then free. So, 4:30 PM is okay.\n\nElijah: Free until 1:00 PM, then busy until 4:00 PM, then free. So, 4:30 PM is okay.\n\nLori: Free until 1:30 PM, then free. So, 4:30 PM is okay.\n\nSo, 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM also works.\n\nIn summary, the possible times are:\n\n- 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM\n- 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM\n- 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM\n- 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM\n- 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM\n- 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM\n- 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM\n\nBut we need to choose the earliest possible time that works for everyone. So, 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM seems to be the earliest.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM works, but let me double-check.\n\nAt 11:30 AM, Andrea is free, Ruth is free, Steven is free, Grace is free, Kyle is free, Elijah is free, and Lori is free. So, yes, that works.\n\nAlternatively, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM is also possible, but 11:30 AM is earlier.\n\nSo, the best time is 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_day):\n    # Convert schedules to time objects for easier manipulation\n    free_times = []\n    for person in participants:\n        free = []\n        for time in person:\n            start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n            end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n            free.append((start, end))\n        free_times.append(free)\n    \n    # Check each preferred day\n    for day in preferred_day:\n        day_free = True\n        for i, person in enumerate(participants):\n            for time in person:\n                if time[0].date() == day.date():\n                    start = time[0]\n                    end = time[1]\n                    if not (end < start + meeting_duration):\n                        day_free = False\n                        break\n            if not day_free:\n                break\n        if day_free:\n            for time in participants[0]:\n                start = time[0]\n                end = time[1]\n                if start.date() == day.date() and end.date() == day.date():\n                    return f\"{start.strftime('%H:%M')}:{end.strftime('%H:%M')}: {day}\"\n    \n    # If no time found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No time found\"\n\n# Example usage\nparticipants = [\n    [\n        (\"09:30\", \"10:30\"),\n        (\"13:30\", \"14:30\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"),\n        (\"15:00\", \"15:30\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"10:00\", \"10:30\"),\n        (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"),\n        (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n        (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"),\n        (\"15:00\", \"16:00\")\n    ],\n    [],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n        (\"10:30\", \"12:00\"),\n        (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"),\n        (\"13:30\", \"15:00\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"16:00\"),\n        (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"11:00\"),\n        (\"11:30\", \"13:00\"),\n        (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"16:00\"),\n        (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n        (\"10:00\", \"11:30\"),\n        (\"12:00\", \"13:30\"),\n        (\"14:00\", \"16:00\"),\n        (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ]\n]\n\nmeeting_duration = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\npreferred_day = [\"Monday\"]\n\nprint(find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_day))\n```",
