            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, I need to find a time to meet John and Jennifer. John is free all week, which is great because it gives me some flexibility. Jennifer, on the other hand, has a busy schedule on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I need to make sure that the meeting doesn't conflict with her schedule and also fit within John's preferences.\n\nFirst, I should look at the days John prefers: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Since John wants to avoid meetings after 14:30 on Monday and Tuesday, and prefers not to meet on Wednesday, I need to consider these constraints.\n\nLet me break down Jennifer's schedule for each day:\n\n- **Monday**: She's busy from 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 17:00. So, the only free time on Monday is between 14:30 to 15:00.\n- **Tuesday**: She's busy from 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 17:00. So, the only free time on Tuesday is before 9:00, which isn't within work hours, and after 17:00, which is outside the workday.\n- **Wednesday**: She's busy from 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 16:00. So, the only free time on Wednesday is from 16:00 to 17:00.\n\nGiven this, the only feasible days are Monday and Wednesday. On Monday, Jennifer is free from 14:30 to 15:00, which fits John's constraint of not meeting after 14:30 on Monday. On Wednesday, she's free from 16:00 to 17:00, which is a later slot.\n\nSince John prefers not to meet on Wednesday, the earliest available time that works for both is on Monday at 14:30 to 15:00. This time slot doesn't conflict with Jennifer's schedule and fits within John's preference of avoiding later meetings on Monday.\n\nTherefore, the meeting should be scheduled for **14:30 to 15:30 on Monday**.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days):\n    # Convert schedules to time objects for easier manipulation\n    free_times = []\n    for person in participants:\n        free = []\n        for time in person:\n            start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n            end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n            free.append((start, end))\n        free_times.append(free)\n    \n    # Check each preferred day\n    for day in preferred_days:\n        day_free = True\n        for person in participants:\n            for time in person:\n                if time[0].date() == day.date():\n                    start = time[0]\n                    end = time[1]\n                    if not (end < start + meeting_duration):\n                        day_free = False\n                        break\n            if not day_free:\n                break\n        if day_free:\n            for time in participants[0]:\n                start = time[0]\n                end = time[1]\n                if start.date() == day.date() and end.date() == day.date():\n                    return f\"{start.strftime('%H:%M')}:{end.strftime('%H:%M')}: {day}\"\n    \n    # If no time found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No time found\"\n\n# Example usage\nparticipants = [\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"17:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"11:00\"),\n        (\"11:30\", \"13:00\"),\n        (\"13:30\", \"14:30\"),\n        (\"15:00\", \"17:00\"),\n        (\"09:00\", \"11:30\"),\n        (\"12:00\", \"17:00\"),\n        (\"09:00\", \"11:30\"),\n        (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"14:00\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"16:00\"),\n        (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ]\n]\n\nmeeting_duration = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\npreferred_days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n\nprint(find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days))\n```",
