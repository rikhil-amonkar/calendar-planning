            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to help schedule a meeting for Wayne, Melissa, Catherine, Gregory, Victoria, Thomas, and Jennifer. The meeting should be 30 minutes long between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Monday. Let me look at each person's schedule and constraints.\n\nWayne is completely free all day. That\u2019s a good start. Melissa has meetings from 10:00-11:00, 12:30-14:00, and 15:00-15:30. So she's busy in those blocks. Catherine is also free the entire day, which gives us more flexibility.\n\nGregory has blocked times from 12:30-13:00 and 15:30-16:00. So those times are off-limits. Victoria is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, and 15:30-16:30. That's a lot of busy periods. Thomas has meetings from 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, and 14:30-16:00. Jennifer has blocks at 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-13:00, 13:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nWayne wants to avoid meetings before 14:00. So we should look for times after 14:00 to accommodate that preference.\n\nLet me list out all the busy periods and see where there are gaps. Starting from 9:00, Victoria is busy until 9:30. Then Melissa is free from 9:30-10:00. But Thomas is busy from 10:00-12:00, so that's a big block.\n\nAfter 12:00, Victoria is free until 13:00, but Thomas is busy again from 12:30-13:00. Gregory is blocked from 12:30-13:00 and 15:30-16:00. So after 13:00, things might start to open up.\n\nLooking at 14:00, Victoria is busy until 14:30, and Thomas is busy from 14:30-16:00. Jennifer is also busy from 14:00-16:30, so that's a long block.\n\nWait, but Wayne wants to avoid before 14:00, so maybe 14:30 is too early for him. Let me check the gaps between 14:00 and 15:00.\n\nFrom 14:00-14:30, Victoria is busy, so that's no good. From 14:30-15:00, Victoria is free, but Thomas is busy until 15:30. So 14:30-15:00 might be a window.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Victoria is free from 14:30-15:00, Thomas is busy from 14:30-16:00, so the meeting would end at 15:00, which is within Thomas's block. That might not work.\n\nHmm, maybe 15:00-15:30 is too late because Thomas is busy until 15:30. So perhaps the next available slot is after 16:00, but that's after work hours.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all participants' schedules again.\n\nMelissa is free from 14:00-15:00 and 15:30-16:00. So between 14:00-15:00, she's free. But Victoria is busy from 14:00-14:30 and 14:30-15:00. So that's fully blocked.\n\nFrom 15:00-15:30, Melissa is busy again. So the next possible slot is after 15:30.\n\nGregory is free from 14:00-12:30 and 16:00-15:30. Wait, no, his blocked times are 12:30-13:00 and 15:30-16:00. So after 15:30, he's free until 16:00.\n\nSo maybe the meeting can be scheduled from 15:30-16:00.\n\nLet me check all participants:\n\n- Wayne: free all day, so 15:30-16:00 is fine.\n- Melissa: free from 15:30-16:00.\n- Catherine: free all day.\n- Gregory: free from 15:30-16:00.\n- Victoria: free from 15:30-16:00.\n- Thomas: busy until 16:00, so 15:30-16:00 is okay because the meeting ends at 16:00.\n- Jennifer: busy until 16:30, so 15:30-16:00 is okay.\n\nSo 15:30-16:00 seems to work for everyone. It's after 14:00, so it satisfies Wayne's preference. I'll go with that time.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define the work hours for the day (Monday)\n    work_hours = [(9, 0), (17, 0)]  # (start hour, start minute), (end hour, end minute)\n\n    # Define the working day in minutes\n    work_day = 17 * 60 - 9 * 60  # 480 minutes (8 hours)\n\n    # Define the blocked times for each participant\n    wayne_blocked = []\n    melissa_blocked = [\n        (10, 0), (11, 0),\n        (12, 30), (14, 0),\n        (15, 0), (15, 30)\n    ]\n    catherine_blocked = []\n    gregory_blocked = [\n        (12, 30), (13, 0),\n        (15, 30), (16, 0)\n    ]\n    victoria_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30),\n        (10, 30), (11, 30),\n        (13, 0), (14, 0),\n        (14, 30), (15, 0),\n        (15, 30), (16, 30)\n    ]\n    thomas_blocked = [\n        (10, 0), (12, 0),\n        (12, 30), (13, 0),\n        (14, 30), (16, 0)\n    ]\n    jennifer_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30),\n        (10, 0), (10, 30),\n        (11, 0), (13, 0),\n        (13, 30), (14, 30),\n        (15, 0), (15, 30),\n        (16, 0), (16, 30)\n    ]\n\n    # Convert blocked times to minutes for easier comparison\n    wayne_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in wayne_blocked]\n    melissa_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in melissa_blocked]\n    catherine_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in catherine_blocked]\n    gregory_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in gregory_blocked]\n    victoria_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in victoria_blocked]\n    thomas_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in thomas_blocked]\n    jennifer_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in jennifer_blocked]\n\n    # Function to check if a time is blocked by a participant\n    def is_blocked(start, end, participant):\n        # Convert start and end to minutes\n        start_min = start * 60\n        end_min = end * 60\n        # Check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n        for block_start, block_end in participant:\n            if (start_min < block_end and end_min > block_start):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible start times within work hours\n    for start_h in range(9, 17):\n        for start_m in range(0, 60):\n            start_min = start_h * 60 + start_m\n            end_min = start_min + duration\n            if end_min > 17 * 60:\n                continue  # End after work hours\n\n            # Check if this time slot is free for everyone\n            if not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, wayne_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, melissa_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, catherine_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, gregory_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, victoria_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, thomas_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, jennifer_blocked):\n                print(f\"{start_h:02}:{start_m:02}-{start_h:02}:{end_min//60:02}\")\n                print(\"Monday\")\n                return\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No available slot found\")\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
