            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Julie, Sean, and Lori. The meeting should last one hour between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should look at each person's schedule and identify their busy times. Julie is blocked from 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-14:00, and 16:00-17:00. Sean has meetings at 9:00-9:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-16:30. Lori is busy from 10:00-10:30, 11:00-13:00, and 15:30-17:00.\n\nI think the best way is to look for gaps where all three can meet. Let's break down the day into time slots and check each hour.\n\nStarting from 9:00 to 10:00. Julie is busy until 9:30, so the first possible time is 9:30-10:00. But Sean is also busy until 9:30, so that won't work. Next, from 10:00-10:30. Lori is busy here, so no go. Then 10:30-11:00. Julie is free from 9:30-11:00, but Lori is busy until 11:00. So maybe 10:30-11:00 is too early for Lori.\n\nLooking at 11:00-11:30, Julie is busy, so that's out. From 11:30-12:00. Julie is free here, but Lori is busy until 13:00. Sean is free after 9:30 and 13:00. So maybe 11:30-12:00 isn't ideal because Lori is busy.\n\nNext, 12:00-12:30. Julie is busy, so that's not good. Then 12:30-13:00. Julie is free here, but Lori is busy until 13:00. So 12:30-13:00 might not work because Lori is still busy until 13:00. Wait, Lori's schedule says 11:00-13:00, so she's busy until 13:00. So 12:30-13:00 is when Lori is still busy. So maybe the next slot after that.\n\nAfter 13:00, let's see. 13:00-13:30. Sean is busy here, so no. Then 13:30-14:00. Julie is busy until 14:00, so she's free after 14:00. Lori is busy until 13:00, so after that, she's free. Sean is free after 13:30. So maybe 14:00-14:30 is a possibility.\n\nWait, let me check each person's schedule again. Julie is free from 14:00 onwards except for 16:00-17:00. Sean is free after 13:30, but he has a meeting at 15:00-15:30 and 16:00-16:30. Lori is free from 13:00 onwards except for 15:30-17:00.\n\nSo between 14:00-15:00, let's see. Julie is free, Sean is free (since his next meeting is at 15:00), and Lori is free. So 14:00-15:00 could work. But the meeting needs to be one hour, so 14:00-15:00 is a one-hour slot. Wait, but Sean has a meeting at 15:00-15:30, so if we start at 14:00, that's fine because the meeting ends at 15:00 before Sean's next meeting.\n\nBut wait, Lori is free from 13:00 onwards except for 15:30-17:00. So she's free from 13:00 to 15:30. So starting at 14:00 is okay for her. Julie is free from 14:00 onwards except for 16:00-17:00, so that's fine. Sean is free after 13:30, so starting at 14:00 is okay.\n\nAlternatively, another slot could be from 15:00-16:00. Let me check. Julie is free from 14:00 onwards except for 16:00-17:00. So she's free at 15:00. Sean has a meeting at 15:00-15:30, so he's busy then. So 15:00-16:00 is when Sean is in a meeting, so that won't work.\n\nAnother possibility is from 16:00-17:00. But Julie is busy here, so that's out.\n\nWait, perhaps another slot. Let's see, after 13:00, Lori is free until 15:30. So maybe 14:00-15:00 is a good spot. Let me confirm:\n\n- Julie: free from 14:00-16:00 (except 16:00-17:00)\n- Sean: free from 13:30-15:00 (next meeting at 15:00)\n- Lori: free from 13:00-15:30\n\nSo 14:00-15:00 works for all. That's a one-hour slot.\n\nAlternatively, another slot could be 15:30-16:30, but Lori is busy until 17:00, so that's possible. Let's check:\n\n- Julie: free from 14:00-16:00 (except 16:00-17:00), so 15:30-16:30 is okay as long as she's not busy. Wait, Julie's schedule shows she's blocked at 16:00-17:00, so she's busy then. So 15:30-16:30 would end at 16:30, which is before her next meeting at 16:00. Wait, no, 16:00 is the start. So 15:30-16:30 would overlap with her 16:00-17:00 meeting. So that's not good.\n\nAnother option is 14:30-15:30. Let's see:\n\n- Julie: free\n- Sean: free until 15:00\n- Lori: free until 15:30\n\nSo 14:30-15:30 would work, but that's a one-hour slot. However, Sean has a meeting at 15:00-15:30, so starting at 14:30 would end at 15:30, which is when Sean's meeting starts. So maybe 14:30 is too late because Sean is busy at 15:00. So the best slot is 14:00-15:00.\n\nWait, but Sean is free until 15:00. So starting at 14:00, the meeting ends at 15:00, which is when Sean's next meeting starts. That's acceptable because the meeting ends before his next meeting. So that works.\n\nSo the proposed time is 14:00-15:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    # Define the work hours for the day (Monday)\n    work_hours = [(9, 0), (17, 0)]  # (start hour, start minute), (end hour, end minute)\n\n    # Define the working day in minutes\n    work_day = 17 * 60 - 9 * 60  # 480 minutes (8 hours)\n\n    # Define the blocked times for each participant\n    julie_blocked = [\n        (9 * 60, 30),  # 9:00-9:30\n        (11 * 60, 30),  # 11:00-11:30\n        (12 * 60, 30),  # 12:00-12:30\n        (13.5 * 60, 0),  # 13:30-14:00\n        (16 * 60, 17 * 60)  # 16:00-17:00\n    ]\n    sean_blocked = [\n        (9 * 60, 30),  # 9:00-9:30\n        (13 * 60, 30),  # 13:00-13:30\n        (15 * 60, 30),  # 15:00-15:30\n        (16 * 60, 30)    # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n    lori_blocked = [\n        (10 * 60, 30),  # 10:00-10:30\n        (11 * 60, 13 * 60),  # 11:00-13:00\n        (15.5 * 60, 17 * 60)  # 15:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Convert blocked times to minutes for easier comparison\n    julie_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in julie_blocked]\n    sean_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in sean_blocked]\n    lori_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in lori_blocked]\n\n    # Function to check if a time is blocked by a participant\n    def is_blocked(start, end, participant):\n        # Convert start and end to minutes\n        start_min = start * 60\n        end_min = end * 60\n        # Check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n        for block_start, block_end in participant:\n            if (start_min < block_end and end_min > block_start):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible start times within work hours\n    for start_h in range(9, 17):\n        for start_m in range(0, 60):\n            start_min = start_h * 60 + start_m\n            end_min = start_min + duration\n            if end_min > 17 * 60:\n                continue  # End after work hours\n\n            # Check if this time slot is free for everyone\n            if not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, julie_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, sean_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, lori_blocked):\n                print(f\"{start_h:02}:{start_m:02}-{start_h:02}:{end_min//60:02}\")\n                print(\"Monday\")\n                return\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No available slot found\")\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
