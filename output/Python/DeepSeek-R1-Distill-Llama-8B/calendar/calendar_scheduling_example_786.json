            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help schedule a meeting between Amy and Pamela for half an hour. The meeting can be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, between 9:00 and 17:00. \n\nFirst, I'll check Amy's schedule. She's busy on Wednesday from 11:00 to 11:30 and 13:30 to 14:00. That means she's free before 11:00 and after 14:00 on Wednesday. \n\nNext, Pamela's schedule is more complex. She has meetings on Monday from 9:00 to 10:30 and 11:00 to 16:30. She's also busy on Tuesday from 9:00 to 9:30 and 10:00 to 17:00. On Wednesday, she has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30. Pamela wants to avoid meetings on Monday, Tuesday before 16:00, and Wednesday before 16:00. \n\nSince the meeting can be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, I'll evaluate each day one by one.\n\nStarting with Monday: Pamela is busy until 10:30 and from 11:00 to 16:30. That leaves her free from 16:30 to 17:00. But Amy isn't busy on Monday, so the only available time on Monday is from 16:30 to 17:00. However, Pamela wants to avoid meetings on Monday, so this isn't ideal.\n\nMoving to Tuesday: Pamela is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 and 10:00 to 17:00. That means she's free from 9:30 to 10:00 and 17:00 to 17:30. But since the meeting needs to be half an hour, the only slot is from 17:00 to 17:30, which is after her last meeting. Amy isn't busy on Tuesday, so this could work. However, Pamela prefers avoiding Tuesday before 16:00, so this might not be her first choice.\n\nFinally, Wednesday: Amy is free before 11:00 and after 14:00. Pamela is busy until 16:30 but has a break from 16:30 to 17:00. So, the available time is from 14:00 to 16:30. But Pamela wants to avoid Wednesday before 16:00, so the latest possible time is 16:30 to 17:00. Since both are free during this period, this seems like a good option.\n\nConsidering Pamela's preferences, Wednesday 16:30 to 17:00 is the best fit as it avoids her busy periods and meets Amy's availability. Therefore, the meeting should be scheduled on Wednesday from 16:30 to 17:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(schedules, duration=\"30:00\"):\n    all_free = []\n    for person in schedules:\n        free_times = []\n        for time in person:\n            if time[1] == True:\n                free_times.append((time[0], time[1]))\n        all_free.append(free_times)\n    \n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n    day_start = datetime.time(9, 0)\n    day_end = datetime.time(17, 0)\n    \n    for day in days:\n        current_day = day_start\n        while current_day <= day_end:\n            end_time = datetime.time((current_day.hour + duration[0]) % 24, (current_day.minute + duration[1]) % 60)\n            if end_time > day_end:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            conflict = False\n            for person in all_free:\n                for time in person:\n                    if time[0] <= current_day < time[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            for person in all_free:\n                for time in person:\n                    if time[0] <= end_time < time[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            for person in all_free:\n                for time in person:\n                    if time[0] <= current_day and current_day < time[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            for person in all_free:\n                for time in person:\n                    if time[0] <= end_time and end_time < time[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            return f\"{current_day.hour:02}:{current_day.minute:02}:{end_time.hour:02}:{end_time.minute:02} {day}\"\n            \n            current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n    \n    return \"No suitable time found\"\n\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time([\n    [\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(13, 30), True),\n        (datetime.time(14, 0), False)\n    ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(9, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(9, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(10, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(10, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(12, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(12, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(13, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(13, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(14, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(14, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(15, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(15, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(16, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(17, 0), False)\n    ],\n    [ (datetime.time(9, 0), True) for _ in range(24*60) ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(9, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(10, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(12, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(13, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(14, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(15, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(17, 0), True)\n    ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(9, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(9, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(10, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(10, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(12, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(12, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(13, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(13, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(14, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(14, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(15, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(15, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(16, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(17, 0), False)\n    ]\n])\n```",
