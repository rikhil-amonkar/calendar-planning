            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for seven people: Patrick, Shirley, Jeffrey, Gloria, Nathan, Angela, and David. The meeting has to be half an hour long between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on Monday. Each person has their own schedule with specific times they're busy, and I need to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I should list out everyone's busy times to see when they're available. Let me go through each person one by one.\n\nStarting with Patrick, he has meetings from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM. So Patrick is busy during those times and is free otherwise.\n\nShirley is busier. She has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30 AM, 11:00 to 11:30 AM, 12:00 to 12:30 PM, 2:30 to 3:00 PM, and 4:00 to 5:00 PM. So Shirley's schedule is pretty packed, but there might be some gaps in between.\n\nJeffrey has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30 AM, 10:30 to 11:00 AM, 11:30 to 12:00 PM, 1:00 to 1:30 PM, and 4:00 to 5:00 PM. So he's also quite busy, but there are some small windows where he might be available.\n\nGloria is busy from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. So she has two specific busy periods and is free otherwise.\n\nNathan is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 AM, 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. That's a lot of time blocked off, but maybe there's a small window in the early afternoon.\n\nAngela has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30 AM, 10:00 to 11:00 AM, 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. So she's busy in the morning, mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and late afternoon.\n\nDavid is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 AM, 10:00 to 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM, and 5:00 PM to 5:30 PM. That leaves him free from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM, but he's busy again after that.\n\nLooking at all these schedules, I need to find a half-hour window where none of them are busy. Let's see.\n\nStarting from 9:00 AM, Patrick is free until 1:30 PM. Shirley is busy until 11:00 AM, so maybe there's a window after that. Jeffrey is busy until 11:00 AM, so perhaps after 11:00 AM. Gloria is busy from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, so maybe around 12:00 PM. Nathan is busy until 12:00 PM, so maybe after that. Angela is busy until 1:30 PM, so maybe after 1:30 PM. David is busy until 2:00 PM, so maybe after 2:00 PM.\n\nWait, but I need to check each person's availability. Let me create a timeline for each person.\n\nPatrick:\n- Busy: 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00\n- Free: 9:00-13:30, 15:00-17:00\n\nShirley:\n- Busy: 09:00-09:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-17:00\n- Free: 09:30-11:00, 12:30-14:30, 15:00-16:00\n\nJeffrey:\n- Busy: 09:00-09:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 16:00-17:00\n- Free: 09:30-10:30, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-16:00\n\nGloria:\n- Busy: 11:30-12:00, 15:00-15:30\n- Free: 09:00-11:30, 12:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00\n\nNathan:\n- Busy: 09:00-09:30, 10:30-12:00, 14:00-17:00\n- Free: 09:30-10:30, 12:00-14:00\n\nAngela:\n- Busy: 09:00-09:30, 10:00-11:00, 13:30-15:00, 16:30-17:30\n- Free: 09:30-10:00, 11:00-13:30, 15:00-16:30\n\nDavid:\n- Busy: 09:00-09:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-14:00, 16:30-17:30\n- Free: 09:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 14:00-16:30\n\nNow, let's look for overlapping free times across all seven.\n\nStarting from 9:30 AM, Patrick is free until 13:30. Shirley is free from 09:30-11:00. Jeffrey is free from 09:30-10:30. Gloria is free from 09:00-11:30. Nathan is free from 09:30-10:30. Angela is free from 09:30-10:00. David is free from 09:30-10:00.\n\nSo from 09:30-10:00, everyone except Patrick is free. But Patrick is free until 13:30, so maybe 09:30-10:00 is a possible time. But let's check if there's a longer window.\n\nAfter 10:00 AM, Shirley is busy until 11:30. Jeffrey is busy until 11:00. Gloria is busy until 11:30. Nathan is busy until 12:00. Angela is busy until 13:30. David is busy until 14:00.\n\nSo from 10:00-10:30, only Patrick and maybe others are free. But it's a short window.\n\nAfter 11:00 AM, Shirley is free until 12:30. Jeffrey is free until 13:00. Gloria is busy until 12:00. Nathan is busy until 12:00. Angela is busy until 13:30. David is busy until 14:00.\n\nSo from 11:00-12:00, Shirley, Jeffrey, and maybe others are free. But Nathan and Gloria are busy until 12:00, so that's a conflict.\n\nAfter 12:00 PM, Shirley is free until 14:30. Jeffrey is free until 13:00. Gloria is free until 15:00. Nathan is free until 14:00. Angela is free until 15:00. David is free until 16:30.\n\nSo from 12:00-13:00, everyone except Patrick is free. Patrick is free until 13:30, so 12:00-13:00 is a possible time.\n\nBut let's see if there's a longer window. After 13:00, Jeffrey is busy until 13:30. So maybe 13:00-13:30 is a window, but Jeffrey is busy then.\n\nAfter 13:30 PM, Patrick is busy until 14:00. So maybe after 14:00.\n\nWait, but Nathan is busy until 17:00, so he's busy all afternoon. Gloria is busy until 15:00. Angela is busy until 16:30. David is busy until 16:30.\n\nSo after 14:00, Patrick is busy until 15:00, but others might have windows.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the earliest available time.\n\nLooking back, the earliest possible time where everyone is free is from 09:30-10:00. But that's only 30 minutes. Alternatively, from 12:00-13:00, which is also 30 minutes.\n\nBut the group prefers the earliest availability. So 09:30-10:00 might be the best option.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFrom 09:30-10:00:\n- Patrick: free\n- Shirley: free\n- Jeffrey: free\n- Gloria: free\n- Nathan: free\n- Angela: free\n- David: free\n\nYes, everyone is free during that time.\n\nBut wait, David is busy from 10:00-10:30. So at 10:00, he's busy. But the meeting is from 09:30-10:00, so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, others have their busy times after that.\n\nSo the earliest available time is 09:30-10:00.\n\nBut let me check if there's a longer window.\n\nAfter 10:00, until 10:30, only Patrick and maybe others are free, but it's a short window.\n\nSo the best time is 09:30-10:00.\n</think>\n\nTo find a suitable meeting time for Patrick, Shirley, Jeffrey, Gloria, Nathan, Angela, and David, we analyzed their individual schedules and identified the earliest available half-hour window where all are free. The meeting will take place from 09:30 to 10:00 AM on Monday.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n\n```python\n'''python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Convert start time to datetime.time object\n    start_time = datetime.time(9)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17)\n\n    # Define each person's busy intervals\n    patrick_busy = [\n        (13, 30), (14, 0)\n    ]\n    shirley_busy = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (11, 0), (11, 30), (12, 0), (12, 30),\n        (14, 30), (16, 0)\n    ]\n    jeffrey_busy = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (10, 30), (11, 0), (11, 30), (12, 0),\n        (13, 0), (13, 30), (16, 0)\n    ]\n    gloria_busy = [\n        (11, 30), (12, 0), (15, 0), (15, 30)\n    ]\n    nathan_busy = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (10, 30), (11, 0), (12, 0),\n        (14, 0), (14, 30), (15, 0), (16, 0), (17, 0)\n    ]\n    angela_busy = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 30), (13, 30),\n        (14, 0), (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 30), (17, 30)\n    ]\n    david_busy = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (10, 0), (10, 30), (11, 0), (11, 30),\n        (12, 0), (12, 30), (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 0),\n        (16, 30), (17, 0), (17, 30)\n    ]\n\n    # Convert busy intervals to time ranges\n    def convert_intervals(intervals):\n        all_time = set()\n        for h, m in intervals:\n            start = datetime.time(h, m)\n            end = start + datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)\n            all_time.add(start)\n            all_time.add(end)\n        return all_time\n\n    patrick_busy = convert_intervals(patrick_busy)\n    shirley_busy = convert_intervals(shirley_busy)\n    jeffrey_busy = convert_intervals(jeffrey_busy)\n    gloria_busy = convert_intervals(gloria_busy)\n    nathan_busy = convert_intervals(nathan_busy)\n    angela_busy = convert_intervals(angela_busy)\n    david_busy = convert_intervals(david_busy)\n\n    # Check each minute from start_time to end_time - duration\n    for minute in range(start_time.hour * 60, end_time.hour * 60 + 1):\n        current = datetime.time(minute // 60, minute % 60)\n        end = current + datetime.timedelta(minutes=duration)\n        end_time = end.time()\n\n        # Check if current minute is free for everyone\n        if (current not in patrick_busy and\n            current not in shirley_busy and\n            current not in jeffrey_busy and\n            current not in gloria_busy and\n            current not in nathan_busy and\n            current not in angela_busy and\n            current not in david_busy):\n            # Check if the entire duration fits in the day\n            if end_time <= datetime.time(17, 0):\n                return f\"{current.hour:02d}:{current.minute:02d} to {end.hour:02d}:{end.minute:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no slot found (shouldn't happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No suitable time found\"\n\n# Get the result\nresult = find_meeting_time()\nprint(f\"{result}\")\n'''",
