The meeting should be half an hour long, and it has to be between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. \n\nFirst, I should look at each person's schedule to see when they're available. Let's start with Jeffrey. He has meetings from 9:30 to 10:00 and 10:30 to 11:00. That means he's busy during those times, so the meeting can't be in those slots.\n\nNext, Virginia has some blocked times: 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 14:30 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30. So Virginia is busy during those periods, which means the meeting can't overlap with any of those times.\n\nThen there's Melissa. She's busy from 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 17:00. That's a lot of busy times. Plus, Melissa would prefer not to meet after 14:00. So the meeting needs to be before 14:00 to accommodate her preference.\n\nI need to find a time slot that's free for all three of them. Let's list out all the possible half-hour slots between 9:00 and 17:00 and see which ones work.\n\nStarting from 9:00, the first possible slot is 9:00 to 9:30. But Jeffrey is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, so if we start at 9:00, that would end at 9:30, which is when Jeffrey is busy. So that slot is out.\n\nNext, 9:30 to 10:00. Jeffrey is busy during that time, so that's not available.\n\nThen, 10:00 to 10:30. Virginia is busy from 10:00 to 10:30, so that's not possible.\n\nAfter that, 10:30 to 11:00. Jeffrey is busy from 10:30 to 11:00, so that's taken.\n\nNext, 11:00 to 11:30. Let's check each person. Jeffrey is free after 11:00. Virginia is busy until 10:30, so she's free after that. Melissa is busy until 11:30, so she's busy during 11:00 to 11:30. So the slot from 11:00 to 11:30 is busy for Melissa.\n\nMoving on, 11:30 to 12:00. Let's see. Jeffrey is free after 11:00, so he's available. Virginia is free after 10:30, so she's available. Melissa is busy until 12:00, so she's busy during 11:30 to 12:00. So that slot is out.\n\nNext, 12:00 to 12:30. Melissa is busy from 12:00 to 12:30, so that's not possible.\n\nThen, 12:30 to 13:00. Let's check. Jeffrey is free. Virginia is free. Melissa is free after 12:30. So this slot seems available.\n\nNext, 13:00 to 13:30. Let's check. Jeffrey is free. Virginia is free. Melissa is free. So this slot is also available.\n\nThen, 13:30 to 14:00. Let's see. Jeffrey is free. Virginia is free. Melissa is free. So this slot is available.\n\nNext, 14:00 to 14:30. But Melissa would rather not meet after 14:00, so this slot is out.\n\nAfter that, 14:30 to 15:00. Let's check. Jeffrey is free. Virginia is busy from 14:30 to 15:00, so that's not possible.\n\nThen, 15:00 to 15:30. Let's see. Jeffrey is free. Virginia is free after 14:30. Melissa is free. So this slot is available.\n\nNext, 15:30 to 16:00. Let's check. Jeffrey is free. Virginia is free. Melissa is free. So this slot is available.\n\nAfter that, 16:00 to 16:30. Virginia is busy from 16:00 to 16:30, so that's not possible.\n\nFinally, 16:30 to 17:00. Let's check. Jeffrey is free. Virginia is free after 16:30. Melissa is busy until 17:00, so that's not possible.\n\nSo the available slots are:\n- 12:30 to 13:00\n- 13:00 to 13:30\n- 13:30 to 14:00\n- 15:00 to 15:30\n- 15:30 to 16:00\n\nNow, I need to choose the best time. The problem says there's a solution that works for everyone, so I can pick any of these slots. Maybe I'll pick the earliest one that works for everyone, which is 12:30 to 13:00.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any conflict I missed?\n\nJeffrey is free from 11:00 onwards, so 12:30 is fine.\n\nVirginia is free after 10:30, so 12:30 is okay.\n\nMelissa is free after 12:30, so 12:30 to 13:00 is okay.\n\nYes, that works. So the meeting can be scheduled from 12:30 to 13:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    start_time = datetime.time(9)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17)\n    \n    # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 for easier calculations\n    def time_to_min(t):\n        return t.hour * 60 + t.minute\n    \n    # Define each person's busy periods as sets of minutes since 9:00\n    jeffrey = {\n        (570, 30),  # 9:30-10:00\n        (690, 30)   # 10:30-11:00\n    }\n    \n    virginia = {\n        (540, 30),  # 9:00-9:30\n        (600, 30),  # 10:00-10:30\n        (1380, 30), # 14:30-15:00\n        (1800, 30)  # 16:00-16:30\n    }\n    \n    melissa = {\n        (540, 90),  # 9:00-11:30\n        (660, 30),  # 12:00-12:30\n        (780, 90),  # 13:00-15:00\n        (1800, 60)  # 16:00-17:00\n    }\n    \n    # Convert busy times to sets for easier checking\n    jeffrey = set(jeffrey for t in jeffrey for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    virginia = set(virginia for t in virginia for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    melissa = set(melissa for t in melissa for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    \n    # Check each possible time slot\n    for minute in range(540, 1080):  # 9:00 to 16:30 in 10-minute increments\n        if minute % 10 != 0:\n            continue\n        start = datetime.time(9, (minute // 10) % 6)\n        end = start + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\n        if end > datetime.time(17):\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the time slot is free for everyone\n        all_free = True\n        for person in [jeffrey, virginia, melissa]:\n            if minute in person:\n                all_free = False\n                break\n        if all_free:\n            print(f\"{start.hour}:{start.minute}:{end.hour}:{end.minute} {start.weekday()}\")\n            return\n    \n    # If no slot found (though problem says there is one)\n    print(\"No available time found\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
