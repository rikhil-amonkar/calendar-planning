            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help schedule a meeting between Larry and Samuel. Larry's calendar is completely open, which is great because it means he doesn't have any prior commitments that could conflict with our meeting. However, Samuel has a pretty busy schedule, especially on Monday and Tuesday, so I need to make sure that our meeting doesn't interfere with his existing meetings.\n\nFirst, I should look at the days we're considering: Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. The problem mentions that Larry would rather not meet on Wednesday, so I should prioritize Monday or Tuesday. But Samuel has some constraints too\u2014he doesn't want any more meetings on Tuesday after 12:30 PM. So, even though Tuesday is an option, I need to make sure that the meeting time on Tuesday doesn't conflict with Samuel's existing meetings after 12:30 PM.\n\nLet me start by looking at the blocked times for Samuel on each day.\n\nOn **Monday**, Samuel has meetings from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. That leaves some gaps in the morning and late afternoon. Specifically, from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM on Monday, there's a free window.\n\nOn **Tuesday**, Samuel is booked from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM. He also mentions he doesn't want any meetings after 12:30 PM on Tuesday. So, after 12:30 PM, he's free until 4:30 PM. That means there's a window from 12:30 PM to 4:30 PM on Tuesday where he's available.\n\nOn **Wednesday**, Samuel has meetings from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM, 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM. This leaves gaps in the morning and late afternoon. Specifically, from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM on Wednesday, there are free slots.\n\nNow, considering Larry's preferences, he doesn't want to meet on Wednesday, so our best options are Monday or Tuesday.\n\nLet's evaluate the available slots on **Monday** first. From 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM, that's a 30-minute window. Since our meeting is half an hour, this fits perfectly.\n\nNext, let's look at **Tuesday**. After 12:30 PM, Samuel is free until 4:30 PM. So, the latest we can meet on Tuesday is at 4:30 PM. The latest possible start time would be 4:00 PM to ensure we have a full 30 minutes. However, Samuel's meeting ends at 4:30 PM, so the latest we can start is 4:00 PM to have the meeting end by 4:30 PM.\n\nComparing the two options, Monday at 4:30 PM and Tuesday at 4:00 PM, the earliest available slot is on Monday. Therefore, the best time to schedule the meeting is Monday at 4:30 PM.\n\nI should also check if there are any other slots on Wednesday, but since Larry prefers not to meet on Wednesday, and Samuel has meetings in the late afternoon, it's better to stick with Monday.\n\nSo, the final decision is to schedule the meeting on Monday at 4:30 PM for half an hour.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    work_hours = [(9, 17), (9, 17), (9, 17)]  # Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday\n    # Meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n    \n    # Blocked times for Samuel\n    blocked_times = {\n        'Monday': [(10 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60), (12 * 60, 12 * 60 + 30), (13 * 60, 15 * 60), \n                  (15 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60 + 30)],\n        'Tuesday': [(9 * 60, 12 * 60), (14 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30), (16 * 60, 17 * 60)],\n        'Wednesday': [(10 * 60, 11 * 60), (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60), (12 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60), \n                     (14 * 60, 14 * 60 + 30), (15 * 60, 16 * 60)]\n    }\n    \n    # Function to check availability\n    def is_available(start, end, day):\n        return not any(block_start <= start < block_end for block_start, block_end in blocked_times.get(day, []))\n    \n    # Check each day for possible meeting times\n    for day in ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']:\n        day_num = {'Monday': 0, 'Tuesday': 1, 'Wednesday': 2}[day]\n        start_time = 9 * 60\n        end_time = 17 * 60\n        \n        # Create a list of all time slots for the day\n        time_slots = []\n        for hour in range(9, 17):\n            for minute in range(0, 60):\n                time_slots.append((hour * 60 + minute, hour * 60 + minute + duration))\n        \n        # Filter time slots based on blocked times\n        available_slots = []\n        for slot in time_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            if 9 * 60 <= time_start < 17 * 60 and 9 * 60 <= time_end < 17 * 60:\n                if is_available(time_start, time_end, day):\n                    available_slots.append(slot)\n        \n        # Find the first available slot that works for both participants\n        for slot in available_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            print(f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d}:{time_end % 60:02d} {day}\")\n            return f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d} {day}\"\n    \n    # If no slot is found, return an error message\n    return \"No available time found.\"\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
