            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Michael, Eric, and Arthur on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 for half an hour. Let's see what each person's schedule looks like.\n\nStarting with Michael, he has meetings from 9:30 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30. That means Michael is busy during those times, so the meeting can't overlap with any of those blocks.\n\nEric's calendar is completely open, which is great because it gives us more flexibility. Eric doesn't have any meetings, so we don't need to worry about conflicting times for him.\n\nArthur has blocked his calendar on Monday from 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. So Arthur is busy during those periods, and the meeting can't happen then.\n\nOur goal is to find a time that works for all three, considering their schedules and constraints. Since Michael has specific blocks, we need to avoid those. Eric is fully available, so we can use his schedule as a reference. Arthur's blocked times also need to be avoided.\n\nLet's break down the day into time slots and see where everyone is available:\n\n1. **9:00 to 9:30**: Arthur is busy until 9:30, so this slot is out.\n2. **9:30 to 10:00**: Michael is in a meeting until 10:30, so this is also busy.\n3. **10:00 to 10:30**: Michael is still in a meeting, so no good.\n4. **10:30 to 11:00**: Michael is free here. Eric is also free. Arthur is busy until 12:00, so this slot is available for Michael and Eric, but Arthur is busy, so it's not a viable option.\n5. **11:00 to 11:30**: Michael is free. Eric is free. Arthur is busy until 12:00, so again, Arthur is a no-go.\n6. **11:30 to 12:00**: Michael is free. Eric is free. Arthur is still busy until 12:00, so Arthur's unavailability continues.\n7. **12:00 to 12:30**: Michael is free. Eric is free. Arthur is busy until 13:00, so Arthur is still not available.\n8. **12:30 to 13:00**: Michael is free. Eric is free. Arthur is busy until 13:00, so Arthur's unavailability continues.\n9. **13:00 to 13:30**: Michael is free. Eric is free. Arthur is busy until 15:00, so Arthur is still not available.\n10. **13:30 to 14:00**: Michael is free. Eric is free. Arthur is busy until 15:00, so Arthur is still not available.\n11. **14:00 to 14:30**: Michael is free. Eric is free. Arthur is busy until 15:00, so Arthur is still not available.\n12. **14:30 to 15:00**: Michael is free. Eric is free. Arthur is busy until 15:00, so Arthur is still not available.\n13. **15:00 to 15:30**: Michael is busy. So this slot is out.\n14. **15:30 to 16:00**: Michael is busy. So this slot is out.\n15. **16:00 to 16:30**: Michael is busy. So this slot is out.\n16. **16:30 to 17:00**: Michael is free. Eric is free. Arthur is busy until 17:00, so Arthur's unavailability continues.\n\nFrom this breakdown, the only time when Michael is free and Arthur is also free is between **14:00 to 14:30**. However, during this time, Arthur is busy until 15:00, so he's not available. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking again, Arthur is busy from 13:00 to 15:00. So from 14:00 to 14:30, Arthur is busy. Therefore, that slot is not available.\n\nNext, **14:30 to 15:00**: Michael is free, Eric is free, but Arthur is busy until 15:00, so Arthur is still not available.\n\nWait, after 15:00, Michael is busy until 15:30. So the next available slot is **16:00 to 16:30**, but Michael is busy until 16:30. So that's out.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through the day again more carefully.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n\n- **9:00 to 9:30**: Arthur busy\n- **9:30 to 10:00**: Michael busy\n- **10:00 to 10:30**: Michael busy\n- **10:30 to 11:00**: Michael free, Eric free, Arthur busy\n- **11:00 to 11:30**: Michael free, Eric free, Arthur busy\n- **11:30 to 12:00**: Michael free, Eric free, Arthur busy\n- **12:00 to 12:30**: Michael free, Eric free, Arthur busy\n- **12:30 to 13:00**: Michael free, Eric free, Arthur busy\n- **13:00 to 13:30**: Michael free, Eric free, Arthur busy\n- **13:30 to 14:00**: Michael free, Eric free, Arthur busy\n- **14:00 to 14:30**: Michael free, Eric free, Arthur busy\n- **14:30 to 15:00**: Michael free, Eric free, Arthur busy\n- **15:00 to 15:30**: Michael busy\n- **15:30 to 16:00**: Michael busy\n- **16:00 to 16:30**: Michael busy\n- **16:30 to 17:00**: Michael free, Eric free, Arthur busy\n\nIt seems like after 15:00, Michael is busy until 16:30. So the only time when Michael is free and Arthur is free is potentially after 16:30, but Arthur is busy until 17:00. So that's not available.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that Arthur is busy from 13:00 to 15:00 and from 16:30 to 17:00. So between 15:00 and 16:30, Arthur is free. Let me check Michael's schedule again.\n\nMichael is busy from 15:00 to 15:30 and from 16:00 to 16:30. So:\n\n- **15:00 to 15:30**: Michael busy\n- **15:30 to 16:00**: Michael free\n- **16:00 to 16:30**: Michael busy\n\nSo the only time when Michael is free and Arthur is free is **15:30 to 16:00**. That's a one-hour window, but we only need half an hour.\n\nSo the meeting can be scheduled from **15:30 to 16:00**.\n\nBut wait, Michael is free from 15:30 to 16:00, Eric is free the entire day, and Arthur is free from 15:00 to 15:30 and from 16:30 to 17:00. So between 15:30 to 16:00, Arthur is free. Therefore, this slot works.\n\nSo the meeting can be scheduled at **15:30 to 16:00** on Monday.\n</think>\n\nThe meeting can be scheduled at **15:30 to 16:00** on Monday.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days):\n    # Convert schedules to time objects for easier manipulation\n    free_times = []\n    for person in participants:\n        free = []\n        for time in person:\n            start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n            end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n            free.append((start, end))\n        free_times.append(free)\n    \n    # Check each preferred day\n    for day in preferred_days:\n        day_free = True\n        for person in participants:\n            for time in person:\n                if time[0].date() == day.date():\n                    start = time[0]\n                    end = time[1]\n                    if not (end < start + meeting_duration):\n                        day_free = False\n                        break\n            if not day_free:\n                break\n        if day_free:\n            for time in participants[0]:\n                start = time[0]\n                end = time[1]\n                if start.date() == day.date() and end.date() == day.date():\n                    return f\"{start.strftime('%H:%M')}:{end.strftime('%H:%M')}: {day}\"\n    \n    # If no time found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No time found\"\n\n# Example usage\nparticipants = [\n    [\n        (\"09:30\", \"10:30\"),\n        (\"15:00\", \"15:30\"),\n        (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"17:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"12:00\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"15:00\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"16:00\"),\n        (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ]\n]\n\nmeeting_duration = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\npreferred_days = [\"Monday\"]\n\nprint(find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days))\n```",
