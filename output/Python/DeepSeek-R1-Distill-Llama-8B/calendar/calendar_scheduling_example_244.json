            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help schedule a meeting for Walter, Cynthia, Ann, Catherine, and Kyle. The meeting should be half an hour long between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on Monday. Let me look at each person's schedule to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, Walter has no meetings all day, so he's available anytime. That's good because it gives me more flexibility.\n\nCynthia is blocked during several intervals: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 13:30-14:30, and 15:00-16:00. I need to avoid these times.\n\nAnn is busy from 10:00-11:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-15:00, and 16:00-16:30. I have to make sure the meeting doesn't overlap with any of these.\n\nCatherine has meetings from 9:00-11:30, 12:30-13:30, and 14:30-17:00. I need to check if there's a gap outside these times.\n\nKyle is blocked during 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-14:30, and 15:00-16:00. So the meeting can't be during these periods.\n\nLet me list all the blocked times for each person and see where they overlap. Maybe I can find a time that fits everyone's schedule.\n\nStarting from 9:00, Walter is free, but Cynthia is blocked until 9:30. So the earliest possible time after 9:30 is 9:30.\n\nFrom 9:30 to 10:00, let's check if others are free. Walter is free, Cynthia is blocked until 10:00, so that's not good. Ann starts at 10:00, so 10:00 isn't available.\n\nAfter 10:00, Cynthia is blocked until 10:30. Ann is busy until 11:00. So between 10:30 and 11:00, let's see. Walter is free, but Ann is busy until 11:00. So that doesn't work.\n\nNext, after 11:00, let's look for gaps. Ann is free from 11:00-13:00. But let's check others. Catherine is blocked until 12:30, and Kyle is blocked until 12:00-12:30. So from 11:00-12:00, Ann is free, but Catherine and Kyle are blocked.\n\nFrom 12:00-12:30, Ann is free, but Catherine and Kyle are blocked. After 12:30, Ann is busy until 13:00. So from 12:30-13:00, Ann is busy, but others might be free.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Ann is busy from 13:00-13:30, so before that, from 12:30-13:00, she's free. But Catherine is blocked until 13:30, and Kyle is blocked until 14:30. So from 12:30-13:00, Ann is free, but others might be available.\n\nLet me see: Walter is free all day, so that's fine. Cynthia is blocked until 13:30, so she's free from 13:30 onwards. Ann is free from 11:00-13:00, so that's a good window.\n\nWait, but from 12:30-13:00, Ann is free, but Catherine is blocked until 13:30, and Kyle is blocked until 14:30. So that could work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better time after 13:00. Let's check.\n\nFrom 13:00-13:30, Ann is busy. So the next available time after that is 13:30. Let's see:\n\nAt 13:30, Cynthia is free, Ann is free after 13:30, Catherine is free after 13:30, and Kyle is free after 14:30. So from 13:30-14:00, let's see.\n\nBut wait, Ann is free from 13:00-13:30 and 14:00-15:00. So from 13:30-14:00, Ann is free, but Catherine is blocked until 14:30, and Kyle is blocked until 14:30. So that might not work.\n\nWait, no, Catherine is blocked from 12:30-13:30, so she's free from 13:30 onwards. So from 13:30-14:00, let's check:\n\n- Walter: free\n- Cynthia: free (blocked until 13:30)\n- Ann: free (busy until 14:00)\n- Catherine: free (blocked until 14:30)\n- Kyle: free (blocked until 14:30)\n\nSo 13:30-14:00 seems available for everyone. But let me check if there's an earlier time.\n\nWait, earlier I thought about 12:30-13:00. Let me confirm:\n\n- Walter: free\n- Cynthia: free (blocked until 13:30)\n- Ann: free (busy until 13:00, then free until 14:00)\n- Catherine: blocked until 13:30\n- Kyle: free (blocked until 14:30)\n\nSo from 12:30-13:00, Ann is free, but Catherine is blocked until 13:30. So that's a conflict.\n\nTherefore, the earliest available time is 13:30-14:00.\n\nBut let me check later times to see if there's a better fit.\n\nAfter 14:00, Ann is busy until 15:00. So from 14:00-15:00, Ann is busy. So the next available time is 15:00.\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- Walter: free\n- Cynthia: free (blocked until 15:00)\n- Ann: busy until 15:00\n- Catherine: free (blocked until 14:30)\n- Kyle: free (blocked until 16:00)\n\nWait, no, Ann is busy until 15:00, so 15:00 isn't available. So the next time after 14:00 is 15:00, but Ann is busy until then. So we have to wait until after 15:00.\n\nBut let's see, Ann is free from 15:00-16:30. So from 15:00 onwards, Ann is free, but others might have constraints.\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- Walter: free\n- Cynthia: free (blocked until 15:00)\n- Ann: free (busy until 15:00, then free)\n- Catherine: free (blocked until 14:30)\n- Kyle: free (blocked until 16:00)\n\nSo at 15:00, Cynthia is free, Ann is free, Catherine is free, Kyle is free, but Walter is free. So 15:00-15:30 could work.\n\nBut let me see if there's a time before 15:00 that works. Earlier, 13:30-14:00 seems to work.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nAt 13:30-14:00:\n\n- Walter: free\n- Cynthia: free (blocked until 13:30)\n- Ann: free (busy until 14:00)\n- Catherine: free (blocked until 14:30)\n- Kyle: free (blocked until 14:30)\n\nYes, that works. So 13:30-14:00 is a good time.\n\nAlternatively, 14:00-14:30:\n\n- Walter: free\n- Cynthia: free (blocked until 15:00)\n- Ann: free (busy until 14:00, then free)\n- Catherine: free (blocked until 14:30)\n- Kyle: free (blocked until 16:00)\n\nSo 14:00-14:30 also works.\n\nBut since the meeting is half an hour, let's see the latest possible time that fits everyone's schedule.\n\nAfter 14:30, Ann is busy until 15:00. So the latest time before Ann's next meeting is 14:30.\n\nSo the best time is 14:30-15:00.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nAt 14:30, Ann is busy until 15:00, so 14:30-15:00 is when Ann is busy. So that's not available.\n\nWait, no, Ann is busy from 14:00-15:00, so she's busy during that time. So the latest time before her meeting is 14:00.\n\nSo 13:30-14:00 is the best option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 14:00-14:30 is also possible if Ann is free then.\n\nWait, Ann is free from 11:00-13:00, then busy from 13:00-14:00, then free from 14:00-15:00.\n\nSo at 14:00, Ann is free, but let's see others:\n\n- Walter: free\n- Cynthia: free (blocked until 15:00)\n- Ann: free (starting at 14:00)\n- Catherine: free (blocked until 14:30)\n- Kyle: free (blocked until 16:00)\n\nSo from 14:00-14:30, everyone is free except Catherine is blocked until 14:30. So 14:00-14:30 is possible.\n\nBut since the meeting is half an hour, we need to end by 14:30. So 14:00-14:30 is possible.\n\nBut let me confirm:\n\nAt 14:00, Ann is free, Catherine is blocked until 14:30, so the meeting can't be after 14:30. So 14:00-14:30 is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the best time is 14:00-14:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define the work hours for the day (Monday)\n    work_hours = [(9, 0), (17, 0)]  # (start hour, start minute), (end hour, end minute)\n\n    # Define the working day in minutes\n    work_day = 17 * 60 - 9 * 60  # 480 minutes (8 hours)\n\n    # Define the blocked times for each participant\n    walter_blocked = []\n    cynthia_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30),  # 9:00-9:30 AM\n        (10, 0), (10, 30),  # 10:00-10:30 AM\n        (13, 30), (14, 30),  # 1:30-2:30 PM\n        (15, 0), (16, 0)    # 3:00-4:00 PM\n    ]\n    ann_blocked = [\n        (10, 0), (11, 0),  # 10:00-11:00 AM\n        (13, 0), (13, 30),  # 1:00-1:30 PM\n        (14, 0), (15, 0),  # 2:00-3:00 PM\n        (16, 0), (16, 30)  # 4:00-4:30 PM\n    ]\n    catherine_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (11, 30),  # 9:00-11:30 AM\n        (12, 30), (13, 30),  # 12:30-1:30 PM\n        (14, 30), (17, 0)   # 2:30-5:00 PM\n    ]\n    kyle_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30),  # 9:00-9:30 AM\n        (10, 0), (11, 30),  # 10:00-11:30 AM\n        (12, 0), (12, 30),  # 12:00-12:30 PM\n        (13, 0), (14, 30),  # 1:00-2:30 PM\n        (15, 0), (16, 0)    # 3:00-4:00 PM\n    ]\n\n    # Convert blocked times to minutes for easier comparison\n    walter_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in walter_blocked]\n    cynthia_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in cynthia_blocked]\n    ann_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in ann_blocked]\n    catherine_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in catherine_blocked]\n    kyle_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in kyle_blocked]\n\n    # Function to check if a time is blocked by a participant\n    def is_blocked(start, end, participant):\n        # Convert start and end to minutes\n        start_min = start * 60\n        end_min = end * 60\n        # Check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n        for block_start, block_end in participant:\n            if (start_min < block_end and end_min > block_start):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible start times within work hours\n    for start_h in range(9, 17):\n        for start_m in range(0, 60):\n            start_min = start_h * 60 + start_m\n            end_min = start_min + duration\n            if end_min > 17 * 60:\n                continue  # End after work hours\n\n            # Check if this time slot is free for everyone\n            if not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, walter_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, cynthia_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, ann_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, catherine_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, kyle_blocked):\n                print(f\"{start_h:02}:{start_m:02}-{start_h:02}:{end_min//60:02}\")\n                print(\"Monday\")\n                return\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No available slot found\")\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
