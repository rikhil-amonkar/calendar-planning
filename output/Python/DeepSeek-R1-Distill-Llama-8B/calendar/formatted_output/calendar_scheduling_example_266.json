            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to figure out how to schedule a meeting for Joe, Keith, Patricia, Nancy, and Pamela. The meeting should last half an hour between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on Monday. Each person has specific times blocked off, so I need to find a time slot that doesn't conflict with anyone.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the blocked times for each person:\n\n- **Joe**: 9:30-10:00 and 10:30-11:00.\n- **Keith**: 11:30-12:00 and 15:00-15:30.\n- **Patricia**: 9:00-9:30 and 13:00-13:30.\n- **Nancy**: 9:00-11:00, 11:30-16:30.\n- **Pamela**: She has a lot of blocks: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nI need to find a 30-minute window that's free for all. Let me look at the gaps between their blocked times.\n\nStarting from 9:00, Patricia is blocked until 9:30. So the first available slot after 9:00 is 9:30-10:00, but Joe is busy then. Next, after Joe's first meeting at 10:00, the next free time for Joe is after 11:00. Let's check what others have.\n\nNancy is busy until 11:00, so the next available time after 11:00 would be 11:30. Keith is busy from 11:30-12:00, so the next slot after that is 12:00-12:30. Let me see if that works.\n\nAt 12:00, Pamela's last block ends at 12:00, so 12:00-12:30 is free for her. Keith is free after 12:00. Joe is free after 11:00, so 12:00 is okay. Patricia is free until 13:00, so 12:00-12:30 is available. Nancy is free after 11:30, so yes, this slot works.\n\nWait, but let me double-check Pamela's schedule. She has a block from 11:30-12:30, so 12:00-12:30 is within that, which means she's busy. Oh, so that slot isn't available.\n\nHmm, so 12:00-12:30 is taken by Pamela. Let me look for the next available time after her 12:30 block. The next Pamela block starts at 13:00. So between 12:30 and 13:00, is there a window?\n\nYes, 12:30-13:00. Let me check others:\n\n- Joe: His last meeting is at 11:00, so he's free after that. 12:30-13:00 is fine.\n- Keith: He's free after 12:00, so 12:30-13:00 is okay.\n- Patricia: She's free until 13:00, so 12:30-13:00 is available.\n- Nancy: She's free after 11:30, so yes.\n\nPamela is busy until 13:00, so 12:30-13:00 is within her block. Wait, she's blocked from 12:30-13:00, so that's a conflict. So that slot isn't available.\n\nI need to find the next slot after Pamela's 13:00 block. Her next block is 14:30-15:00. So between 13:00 and 14:30, there's a gap.\n\nFrom 13:00 to 14:30, let's check:\n\n- Joe: He's free after 11:00, so yes.\n- Keith: He's free after 12:00, so yes.\n- Patricia: She's busy from 13:00-13:30, so 13:00-13:30 is blocked. The next available is after 13:30.\n- Nancy: She's free after 11:30, so yes.\n- Pamela: She's free after 13:00 until 14:30, so 13:00-14:30 is free for her.\n\nWait, but Patricia is busy from 13:00-13:30. So the earliest available time after 13:30 would be 13:30-14:00.\n\nLet me check that:\n\n- 13:30-14:00:\n  - Joe: Free.\n  - Keith: Free.\n  - Patricia: Free after 13:30.\n  - Nancy: Free.\n  - Pamela: Free after 13:00, so yes.\n\nSo 13:30-14:00 seems available for all. That's a 30-minute window.\n\nAlternatively, another option could be after Pamela's next block, but 14:30-15:00 is her next meeting. Let me see if there's a slot before that.\n\nWait, after 13:30, the next Pamela block is 14:30-15:00. So between 13:30 and 14:30, the only blocked time is her own from 14:00-14:30. Wait, no, Pamela's blocks are 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00. So from 13:30 to 14:00, is that free? No, because Pamela is busy from 13:00-14:00. So 13:30-14:00 is within her block, which is 13:00-14:00. So that's a conflict.\n\nSo the next available time after 13:30 would be after her 14:00-14:30 block. Wait, no, her blocks are 13:00-14:00, then 14:30-15:00. So between 14:00 and 14:30, is that free? Pamela is busy from 14:30-15:00, so 14:00-14:30 is free for her. Let me check others:\n\n- Joe: Free.\n- Keith: Free.\n- Patricia: Free after 13:30.\n- Nancy: Free.\n- Pamela: Free from 14:00-14:30.\n\nSo 14:00-14:30 is a possible slot. That's another 30-minute window.\n\nBut wait, the earliest available time is 13:30-14:00, but that's conflicting with Pamela. So the next is 14:00-14:30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another slot earlier in the day. Let me check the morning again.\n\nAfter 11:30, Keith is busy until 12:00. So after 12:00, is there a slot?\n\nPamela is busy until 12:30, so the next available is 12:30-13:00. But Pamela is busy until 13:00, so that's conflicting.\n\nWait, Pamela's block is 11:30-12:30, so 12:30-13:00 is free. Wait, no, her block ends at 12:30, so 12:30-13:00 is free for her. Let me check others:\n\n- Joe: Free after 11:00.\n- Keith: Free after 12:00.\n- Patricia: Free until 13:00.\n- Nancy: Free after 11:30.\n- Pamela: Free from 12:30-13:00.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is a possible slot. That's another option.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Pamela is busy until 12:30, so 12:30-13:00 is free. So that's a 30-minute window.\n\nSo possible slots are:\n\n1. 12:30-13:00\n2. 13:30-14:00 (but Pamela is busy until 14:00, so 13:30-14:00 is conflicting)\nWait, no, Pamela is busy from 13:00-14:00, so 13:30-14:00 is within her block. So that's conflicting.\n\nSo the next available is 14:00-14:30.\n\nAlternatively, 14:00-14:30.\n\nSo the possible slots are 12:30-13:00 and 14:00-14:30.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact blocked times.\n\nPamela's blocks are:\n\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 11:30-12:30\n- 13:00-14:00\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 15:30-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is after her 11:30-12:30 block, so yes, free.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is a possible slot.\n\nLet me confirm with all:\n\n- Joe: Free after 11:00, so yes.\n- Keith: Free after 12:00, so yes.\n- Patricia: Free until 13:00, so yes.\n- Nancy: Free after 11:30, so yes.\n- Pamela: Free from 12:30-13:00, yes.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is a good option.\n\nAnother option is 14:00-14:30.\n\nCheck:\n\n- Pamela: Free from 14:00-14:30.\n- Joe: Free.\n- Keith: Free.\n- Patricia: Free after 13:30.\n- Nancy: Free.\n\nSo both 12:30-13:00 and 14:00-14:30 are available.\n\nWhich one is better? Maybe 12:30-13:00 is earlier and might be preferred.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another slot in the afternoon.\n\nAfter 16:00, Pamela is free until 17:00, but let's see:\n\n- 16:00-16:30: Pamela is free.\n- 16:30-17:00: Pamela is free.\n\nBut let's check others:\n\n- Joe: He's free after 11:00, so yes.\n- Keith: He's free after 15:30, so yes.\n- Patricia: She's free after 13:30, so yes.\n- Nancy: She's free after 11:30, so yes.\n\nSo 16:00-16:30 is another option.\n\nBut 16:00 is later, so maybe the earliest available is better.\n\nSo possible slots are 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nI think the earliest is 12:30-13:00.\n\nSo the meeting can be scheduled at 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM on Monday.\n\nNow, to write a Python script that finds this time.\n\nThe script needs to:\n\n1. Define the participants and their blocked times.\n2. For each time slot between 9:00 and 17:00, check if it's free for all participants.\n3. Find the earliest 30-minute slot that fits.\n\nI'll represent the blocked times as sets of tuples, where each tuple is (start, end).\n\nThen, for each possible start time from 9:00 to 16:30 (since the meeting is 30 minutes), check if the entire 30-minute window is free for all.\n\nThe earliest such window is the solution.\n\nSo in code:\n\n- Define the participants and their blocked times.\n- Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 for easier comparison.\n- For each possible start time from 9:00 to 16:30, check if the next 30 minutes don't overlap with any blocked time for any participant.\n- If found, return the earliest such time.\n\nI'll need to handle time conversions, like 9:00 is 0 minutes, 9:30 is 30, etc.\n\nSo the code will:\n\n- Iterate start_time from 0 to 990 (16:30) in 30-minute increments.\n- For each start_time, check if the next 30 minutes (start_time to start_time+30) is free for all.\n- If yes, return that time.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, define the participants and their blocked times.\n\nThen, for each possible start time, check against each participant's blocked times.\n\nIf all participants have no overlap, then it's a possible slot.\n\nSelect the earliest one.\n\nSo the code will look like:\n\nparticipants = [\n    {'name': 'Joe', 'blocks': [(90, 120), (210, 240)]},  # 9:30-10:00 and 10:30-11:00\n    {'name': 'Keith', 'blocks': [(330, 360), (900, 930)]},  # 11:30-12:00 and 15:00-15:30\n    {'name': 'Patricia', 'blocks': [(0, 30), (780, 810)]},  # 9:00-9:30 and 13:00-13:30\n    {'name': 'Nancy', 'blocks': [(0, 90), (330, 990)]},  # 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-16:30\n    {'name': 'Pamela', 'blocks': [(0, 60), (150, 180), (270, 300), (780, 840), (870, 900), (930, 960), (990, 1020)]}  # Her blocks\n]\n\nThen, for each possible start time, check each participant's blocks.\n\nSo, in the code, for each start in 0, 30, 60, ..., 990:\n\nfor start in range(0, 990, 30):\n    slot = (start, start + 30)\n    # Check all participants\n    conflict = False\n    for participant in participants:\n        for block in participant['blocks']:\n            if not (block[1] < slot[0] or block[0] > slot[1]):\n                conflict = True\n                break\n        if conflict:\n            break\n    if not conflict:\n        print(f\"{start//30:02d}:{start%30:02d}-{start+30//30:02d}:{start+30%30:02d} {day}\")\n        exit()\n\nSo, the day is \"Monday\".\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nI think that's the approach.\n</think>\n\n```python\nparticipants = [\n    {'name': 'Joe', 'blocks': [(90, 120), (210, 240)]},  # 9:30-10:00 and 10:30-11:00\n    {'name': 'Keith', 'blocks': [(330, 360), (900, 930)]},  # 11:30-12:00 and 15:00-15:30\n    {'name': 'Patricia', 'blocks': [(0, 30), (780, 810)]},  # 9:00-9:30 and 13:00-13:30\n    {'name': 'Nancy', 'blocks': [(0, 90), (330, 990)]},  # 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-16:30\n    {'name': 'Pamela', 'blocks': [(0, 60), (150, 180), (270, 300), (780, 840), (870, 900), (930, 960), (990, 1020)]}  # Her blocks\n]\n\nday = \"Monday\"\n\nfor start in range(0, 990, 30):\n    slot = (start, start + 30)\n    conflict = False\n    for participant in participants:\n        for block in participant['blocks']:\n            if not (block[1] < slot[0] or block[0] > slot[1]):\n                conflict = True\n                break\n        if conflict:\n            break\n    if not conflict:\n        print(f\"{start//30:02d}:{start%30:02d}-{(start+30)//30:02d}:{(start+30)%30:02d} {day}\")\n        exit()\n```",
