            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Margaret, Donna, and Helen. The meeting should be half an hour long and can happen any day between Monday and Friday, but the user specifically wants it on Monday. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each person's schedule to see when they're free. Margaret is busy from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, and 15:00 to 15:30. So, the only free time slots for her on Monday are between 12:00 to 13:00 and 13:30 to 14:30.\n\nDonna has blocked her calendar on Monday during 14:30 to 15:00 and 16:00 to 16:30. That means she's busy during those times, so her free slots are before 14:30 and after 16:30.\n\nHelen has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 17:00. She also mentioned she doesn't want to meet after 13:30. So, her free time on Monday is between 11:30 to 13:00 and 15:00 to 15:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that works for all three. Let's look at Margaret's free slots first: 12:00 to 13:00 and 13:30 to 14:30. Donna is free before 14:30, so the 13:30 to 14:30 slot is a possibility, but Helen doesn't want to meet after 13:30. So, that's out.\n\nNext, let's check the 12:00 to 13:00 slot. Margaret is free there, but Helen is free from 11:30 to 13:00. Donna is also free before 14:30, so this seems like a good option. \n\nWait, but Helen's meeting ends at 13:00, so if the meeting starts at 12:30, that would be within her free time. But Margaret's meeting starts at 12:00, so maybe 12:30 is a good time. Let me double-check:\n\n- Margaret: Free from 12:00 to 13:00\n- Donna: Free before 14:30\n- Helen: Free from 11:30 to 13:00\n\nSo, 12:30 seems to work for everyone. It's within all their free slots and doesn't conflict with any of their constraints. Plus, it's before 13:30, so Helen is happy with that.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days):\n    # Convert schedules to time objects for easier manipulation\n    free_times = []\n    for person in participants:\n        free = []\n        for time in person:\n            start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n            end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n            free.append((start, end))\n        free_times.append(free)\n    \n    # Check each preferred day\n    for day in preferred_days:\n        day_free = True\n        for person in participants:\n            for time in person:\n                if time[0].date() == day.date():\n                    start = time[0]\n                    end = time[1]\n                    if not (end < start + meeting_duration):\n                        day_free = False\n                        break\n            if not day_free:\n                break\n        if day_free:\n            for time in participants[0]:\n                start = time[0]\n                end = time[1]\n                if start.date() == day.date() and end.date() == day.date():\n                    return f\"{start.strftime('%H:%M')}:{end.strftime('%H:%M')}: {day}\"\n    \n    # If no time found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No time found\"\n\n# Example usage\nparticipants = [\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"10:00\"),\n        (\"10:30\", \"11:00\"),\n        (\"11:30\", \"12:00\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"),\n        (\"15:00\", \"15:30\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"14:30\", \"15:00\"),\n        (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n        (\"10:00\", \"11:30\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"14:00\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"15:00\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ]\n]\n\nmeeting_duration = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\npreferred_days = [\"Monday\"]\n\nprint(find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days))\n```",
