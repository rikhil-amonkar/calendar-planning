            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to help schedule a meeting for seven people: Tyler, Kelly, Stephanie, Hannah, Joe, Diana, and Deborah. The meeting should last half an hour between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. Each person has specific times when they're busy or blocked, so I need to find a time slot that doesn't overlap with anyone's busy periods.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's schedule:\n\n- Tyler is completely free all day.\n- Kelly is also completely free.\n- Stephanie has blocks: 11:00-11:30 and 14:30-15:00.\n- Hannah is free all day.\n- Joe has blocks: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-17:00.\n- Diana has meetings: 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n- Deborah is busy: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nI need to find a 30-minute window where none of these blocks overlap. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting from 9:00, let's check each possible 30-minute slot.\n\nFirst, check 9:00-9:30. Joe is busy until 9:30, so that's out.\n\nNext, 9:30-10:00. Joe is free from 9:30 to 10:00, but Diana is busy until 10:30. So 9:30-10:00 is possible, but wait, Diana's first meeting ends at 10:30. So from 9:30 to 10:00, Diana is busy. So 9:30-10:00 is also blocked because Diana is busy.\n\nWait, no, Diana's first meeting is 9:00-10:30, so from 9:30 to 10:30, she's busy. So 9:30-10:00 is within her busy time. So that slot is blocked.\n\nNext, 10:00-10:30. Diana is still busy until 10:30. So that's blocked.\n\n10:30-11:00. Let's see: Joe is free from 10:00-12:00, so he's free in this slot. Diana's meeting ends at 10:30, so from 10:30 onward, she's free until her next meeting at 11:30. So 10:30-11:00 is a possible slot.\n\nCheck others: Tyler and Kelly are free. Stephanie's first block is at 11:00, so 10:30-11:00 is before that. Hannah is free. Joe is free. Diana is free from 10:30-11:00. Deborah's meetings: she's busy until 10:30, so from 10:30 onward, she's free until her next meeting at 12:00. So 10:30-11:00 is free for everyone except Diana and Deborah, but wait, Deborah's last block before 11:00 is 10:30-12:00. So she's busy until 12:00, so 10:30-11:00 is still blocked because she's busy until 12:00.\n\nWait, no, Deborah's schedule is 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, etc. So from 10:30 to 12:00, she's busy. So 10:30-11:00 is within her busy time. So that slot is blocked.\n\nSo next slot is 11:00-11:30. Stephanie has a block here, so that's out.\n\n11:30-12:00. Let's check. Diana has a meeting from 11:30-12:00, so that's blocked. Joe is free until 12:00, but Diana is busy here. So that's out.\n\n12:00-12:30. Joe is free until 12:00, so after 12:00, he's free. Diana's next meeting is at 13:00, so she's free from 12:00-13:00. Deborah is busy until 12:00, so after 12:00, she's free until her next meeting at 13:30. So 12:00-12:30 is a possible slot.\n\nCheck others: Tyler and Kelly are free. Stephanie is free until 14:30. Hannah is free. Joe is free. Diana is free. Deborah is free after 12:00.\n\nSo 12:00-12:30 seems possible. But wait, Joe is free from 10:00-12:00, so 12:00 is the end. So he's free from 12:00 onward. So yes, 12:00-12:30 is available.\n\nBut let's check if there are any other conflicts. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, Diana's meeting ends at 12:00, so she's free from 12:00-13:00. So 12:00-12:30 is okay.\n\nDeborah is busy until 12:00, so after that, she's free until 13:30. So yes, 12:00-12:30 is free.\n\nSo that's a possible slot.\n\nBut let's see if there are later slots that might work better.\n\nNext, 12:30-13:00. Joe is free from 12:00-13:00, so he's free here. Diana is free from 12:00-13:00. Deborah is free from 12:30 onward until 13:30. So 12:30-13:00: let's check each person.\n\nTyler and Kelly: free.\n\nStephanie: free until 14:30.\n\nHannah: free.\n\nJoe: free.\n\nDiana: free.\n\nDeborah: busy until 13:30, so 12:30-13:00 is within her busy time? Wait, her schedule says she's busy from 12:30-13:00. So yes, she's busy in 12:30-13:00. So that slot is blocked.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is out.\n\nNext, 13:00-13:30. Diana is free until 13:00, but she has a meeting from 13:00-14:00. So 13:00-14:00 is blocked. So 13:00-13:30 is part of her meeting, so that's out.\n\n13:30-14:00. Diana is still in her meeting until 14:00, so that's blocked.\n\n14:00-14:30. Diana's meeting ends at 14:00, so she's free from 14:00 onward. Joe is free from 14:00-17:00, except he's busy from 14:00-17:00. Wait, Joe's schedule says he's busy from 14:00-17:00. So 14:00-14:30 is within his busy time, so that's out.\n\n14:30-15:00. Stephanie has a block here, so that's out.\n\n15:00-15:30. Let's see. Joe is busy until 17:00, so 15:00-17:00 is his busy time. So 15:00-15:30 is blocked.\n\n15:30-16:00. Joe is still busy. Diana's next meeting is at 16:00, so she's free from 15:30-16:00. Wait, Diana's meetings are 14:30-15:30 and 16:00-17:00. So 15:30-16:00 is free for her. Joe is busy until 17:00, so 15:30-16:00 is blocked for him. So that slot is out.\n\n16:00-16:30. Diana is busy here, so that's out.\n\n16:30-17:00. Diana is free after 17:00, but Joe is busy until 17:00. So 16:30-17:00: Joe is busy until 17:00, so that's blocked.\n\nWait, but Joe is busy from 14:00-17:00, so 16:30-17:00 is within his busy time. So that's out.\n\nSo the only possible slot I found so far is 12:00-12:30.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other slots I might have missed.\n\nLooking back, after 12:00, the next possible slot was 12:00-12:30, which works. Then 12:30-13:00 is blocked by Deborah, and so on.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe looking for a 30-minute window that doesn't conflict with anyone's busy times.\n\nLet me list all the busy intervals and see where there's a gap of at least 30 minutes.\n\nStart by listing all the busy intervals:\n\n- Joe: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-17:00.\n- Diana: 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n- Deborah: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nSo combining all these, let's sort them by time:\n\n1. 9:00-9:30 (Joe)\n2. 9:00-10:30 (Diana)\n3. 9:00-10:00 (Deborah)\n4. 10:00-10:30 (Diana)\n5. 10:30-12:00 (Deborah)\n6. 10:00-12:00 (Joe)\n7. 11:30-12:00 (Diana)\n8. 12:00-12:30 (Deborah)\n9. 12:30-13:00 (Deborah)\n10. 12:30-13:00 (Joe)\n11. 13:00-14:00 (Diana)\n12. 13:30-14:00 (Deborah)\n13. 14:00-15:30 (Diana)\n14. 14:30-15:30 (Deborah)\n15. 14:00-17:00 (Joe)\n16. 16:00-16:30 (Deborah)\n17. 16:00-17:00 (Diana)\n\nNow, let's look for gaps between these intervals where there's at least 30 minutes.\n\nBetween 9:30-10:00: Joe is free, but Diana is busy until 10:30, and Deborah is busy until 10:00. So from 9:30-10:00, Diana is busy, so no.\n\nBetween 10:00-10:30: Diana is busy, Joe is busy until 12:00, Deborah is busy until 10:30. So no.\n\nBetween 10:30-11:30: Diana is busy until 11:30, Joe is busy until 12:00. So no.\n\nBetween 11:30-12:00: Diana is busy, Joe is busy until 12:00. So no.\n\nBetween 12:00-12:30: Deborah is busy until 12:30, so no.\n\nBetween 12:30-13:00: Deborah is busy until 13:00, so no.\n\nBetween 13:00-13:30: Diana is busy until 14:00. So 13:00-13:30 is Diana's busy time, so no.\n\nBetween 13:30-14:00: Deborah is busy until 14:00, so no.\n\nBetween 14:00-14:30: Diana is busy until 14:30, Joe is busy until 17:00. So no.\n\nBetween 14:30-15:00: Diana is busy until 15:30, Joe is busy. So no.\n\nBetween 15:00-15:30: Diana is busy until 15:30, Joe is busy. So no.\n\nBetween 15:30-16:00: Diana is free, but Joe is busy until 17:00. So 15:30-16:00: Diana is free, but Joe is busy. So that's out.\n\nBetween 16:00-16:30: Diana is busy, so no.\n\nAfter 16:30, the next available is 16:30-17:00, but Joe is busy until 17:00, so no.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 12:00-12:30 is possible. Let me check again.\n\nAt 12:00, Joe's meeting ends at 12:00, so he's free from 12:00 onward. Diana's meeting ends at 12:00, so she's free from 12:00 onward. Deborah is busy until 12:00, so from 12:00 onward, she's free until her next meeting at 12:30. So 12:00-12:30: Joe and Diana are free, but Deborah is busy until 12:30. So 12:00-12:30 is blocked because Deborah is busy.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So 12:00-12:30 is blocked because Deborah is busy until 12:00, and from 12:00 to 12:30, she's busy. So that slot is out.\n\nHmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking at the sorted busy intervals, after 12:00, the next available slot would be after 13:00. But Diana is busy from 13:00-14:00, and Joe is busy until 17:00. So after 14:00, Diana is free, but Joe is still busy.\n\nWait, Diana is free from 14:00 onward, but Joe is busy until 17:00. So 14:00-14:30 is blocked by Joe, 14:30-15:00 is blocked by Stephanie, 15:00-15:30 by Joe, 15:30-16:00 by Joe, 16:00-16:30 by Diana and Deborah, and 16:30-17:00 by Joe.\n\nSo perhaps the only possible slot is earlier.\n\nWait, maybe between 10:30-11:00. Let me check again.\n\nAt 10:30, Diana's meeting ends, so she's free. Joe is free from 10:00-12:00, so he's free at 10:30. Deborah is busy until 12:00, so at 10:30, she's still busy. So 10:30-11:00: Diana is free, Joe is free, but Deborah is busy. So that slot is out because Deborah is busy.\n\nWait, but Deborah is busy from 10:30-12:00, so 10:30-11:00 is within her busy time. So that slot is blocked.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to look for a slot that starts at 11:30. But Diana is busy until 11:30, so 11:30-12:00 is blocked.\n\nWait, maybe after 13:00. Let's see.\n\nAt 13:00, Diana's meeting ends, so she's free. Joe is free from 12:00-13:00, so he's free after 13:00. But Deborah is busy until 13:00, so 13:00-13:30 is blocked.\n\nWait, no, Deborah's busy times are 12:30-13:00, so 13:00 onward, she's free until 14:30. So 13:00-13:30: Diana is free, Joe is free, Deborah is free. So that's a possible slot.\n\nWait, let me check each person:\n\n- Tyler: free.\n- Kelly: free.\n- Stephanie: free until 14:30.\n- Hannah: free.\n- Joe: free from 12:00-17:00, so yes.\n- Diana: free from 13:00-14:00.\n- Deborah: free from 13:00-14:30.\n\nSo 13:00-13:30: all are free except maybe Diana, who is free during that time.\n\nWait, Diana is free from 13:00-14:00, so 13:00-13:30 is okay.\n\nSo 13:00-13:30 is a possible slot.\n\nBut earlier I thought that 12:00-12:30 was possible, but now I see it's blocked by Deborah.\n\nSo 13:00-13:30 seems better.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.\n\nAt 13:00:\n\n- Diana's meeting ends at 13:00, so she's free.\n- Joe is free from 12:00-17:00.\n- Deborah is busy until 12:30, so after 12:30, she's free until 14:30. So 13:00-13:30 is within her free time.\n\nSo yes, 13:00-13:30 is a possible slot.\n\nIs there a later slot that works?\n\n14:00-14:30: Diana is free, but Joe is busy until 17:00, so that's out.\n\n14:30-15:00: Stephanie has a block, so out.\n\n15:00-15:30: Joe is busy, out.\n\n15:30-16:00: Joe is busy, out.\n\n16:00-16:30: Diana and Deborah are busy, out.\n\n16:30-17:00: Joe is busy, out.\n\nSo the only possible slot is 13:00-13:30.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another slot between 12:00 and 13:00.\n\nAt 12:30-13:00: Deborah is busy until 13:00, so that's out.\n\nSo the only slot is 13:00-13:30.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought 12:00-12:30 was possible, but now I see it's blocked by Deborah.\n\nSo the correct slot is 13:00-13:30.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\n13:00-13:30:\n\n- Tyler: free.\n- Kelly: free.\n- Stephanie: free.\n- Hannah: free.\n- Joe: free.\n- Diana: free (13:00-14:00).\n- Deborah: free (13:00-14:30).\n\nYes, all are free during 13:00-13:30.\n\nSo the meeting can be scheduled at 13:00-13:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a suitable time for scheduling a meeting for seven participants considering their existing schedules and constraints. The meeting duration is 30 minutes, and it should be scheduled between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. Each participant has specific time slots when they are either busy or free, which we need to consider to find a suitable time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Free Slots**: First, we identify the free slots for each participant by examining their schedules and noting the time intervals when they are not busy.\n2. **Combine Free Slots**: We then combine the free slots of all participants to find overlapping intervals where everyone is free.\n3. **Check for Gaps**: We look for gaps in the combined busy schedules to identify potential slots where a meeting can be scheduled without overlapping any busy times.\n4. **Select the Best Slot**: Among all possible slots, we select the one that best fits the meeting requirements, considering any preferences or constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom datetime import time as Time\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the participants and their schedules\n    participants = {\n        'Tyler': ('09:00', '17:00'),\n        'Kelly': ('09:00', '17:00'),\n        'Stephanie': (\n            ('11:00', '11:30'),\n            ('14:30', '15:00')\n        ),\n        'Hannah': ('09:00', '17:00'),\n        'Joe': (\n            ('09:00', '09:30'),\n            ('10:00', '12:00'),\n            ('12:30', '13:00'),\n            ('14:00', '17:00')\n        ),\n        'Diana': (\n            ('09:00', '10:30'),\n            ('11:30', '12:00'),\n            ('13:00', '14:00'),\n            ('14:30', '15:30'),\n            ('16:00', '17:00')\n        ),\n        'Deborah': (\n            ('09:00', '10:00'),\n            ('10:30', '12:00'),\n            ('12:30', '13:00'),\n            ('13:30', '14:00'),\n            ('14:30', '15:30'),\n            ('16:00', '16:30')\n        )\n    }\n\n    # Convert time strings to minutes since 09:00\n    def to_minutes(time_str):\n        h, m = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n        return h * 60 + m\n\n    # Convert each participant's schedule to a list of busy intervals\n    busy_times = {}\n    for name, schedule in participants.items():\n        times = []\n        for start, end in schedule:\n            start_min = to_minutes(start)\n            end_min = to_minutes(end)\n            times.append((start_min, end_min))\n        busy_times[name] = times\n\n    # Function to check if a time is busy for a participant\n    def is_busy(name, time_min):\n        for start, end in busy_times[name]:\n            if start <= time_min < end:\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # The meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n\n    # Iterate through possible start times from 09:00 to 16:30\n    for start_h in range(9, 17):\n        for start_m in range(0, 60):\n            current_time = start_h * 60 + start_m\n            end_time = current_time + duration\n\n            # Check if end_time is within the day (09:00 to 17:00)\n            if end_time >= 17 * 60:\n                continue\n\n            # Check if everyone is free at current_time\n            all_free = True\n            for name in participants:\n                if is_busy(name, current_time):\n                    all_free = False\n                    break\n            if all_free:\n                # Format the time and return\n                return f\"{start_h:02d}:{start_m:02d}:{end_h:02d}:{end_m:02d} {day_of_week}\"\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states a solution exists)\n    return \"No suitable time found\"\n\n# Determine the day of the week (Monday)\nday_of_week = \"Monday\"\n\n# Run the function and print the result\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code first converts each participant's schedule into a list of busy time intervals. It then iterates through each possible start time from 9:00 to 16:30, checking if a 30-minute meeting can be scheduled without anyone being busy. For each start time, it verifies if all participants are free during that interval. The first valid time slot found is returned, formatted as \"HH:MM:HH:MM\" along with the day of the week. This approach ensures that we find a suitable time slot efficiently by checking each possible time in a systematic manner.",
