            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help schedule a meeting between Judith and Timothy. Let's see what constraints we have.\n\nFirst, the meeting should be one hour long between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Judith prefers avoiding meetings on Monday and Wednesday before 12:00. So, the best day might be Tuesday or Monday after 12:00.\n\nLooking at Judith's schedule: she's blocked Monday from 12:00-12:30. So, after that, she's free until her next block on Wednesday at 11:30. But since she wants to avoid Wednesday before 12:00, maybe Monday is possible after 12:30.\n\nNow, Timothy's schedule is more extensive. On Monday, he's blocked from 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:30-14:00, 15:30-17:00. So, gaps are 11:30-12:30 and 14:00-15:30.\n\nIf we consider Monday, the latest slot after 12:30 is 14:00-15:30. But wait, Timothy's blocked until 14:00, so the gap is from 14:00 to 15:30. That's a 1.5-hour window. But we need a one-hour slot. So, maybe 14:00-15:00 or 15:00-16:00? Wait, no, because 14:00-15:30 is his blocked time, so the available slot is 14:00-15:30? No, wait, he's blocked from 12:30-14:00, so he's free from 14:00 onwards. Wait, no, he's blocked from 12:30-14:00, so he's busy until 14:00. So, the next available time is 14:00 onwards. But he's blocked from 15:30-17:00. So, from 14:00 to 15:30, he's free? Wait, no, because he's blocked from 15:30-17:00. So, he's available from 14:00 to 15:30, but the meeting needs to be one hour. So, possible times are 14:00-15:00 or 15:00-16:00.\n\nWait, but Judith is available on Monday after 12:30. So, if we pick 14:00-15:00, that's a one-hour slot. Let me check if that works for both.\n\nJudith's schedule on Monday: she's blocked 12:00-12:30, so 14:00 is available. Timothy is available from 14:00 to 15:30. So, 14:00-15:00 is a possible time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Tuesday is better because Judith might have more availability.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judith's schedule is not mentioned, so she's free unless she has other constraints. But the problem says she wants to avoid more meetings on Monday, so maybe Tuesday is a better option.\n\nLooking at Timothy's schedule on Tuesday: he's blocked from 9:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-17:00. So, his available times are 13:00-13:30 and 14:00-14:30.\n\nWe need a one-hour slot. So, 13:00-14:00 is possible. But wait, he's blocked from 13:30-14:00, so he's free from 13:00-13:30 and 14:00-14:30. But 13:00-14:00 would include his blocked time, so that's not possible. So, the available slots are 13:00-13:30 and 14:00-14:30. But we need a one-hour slot, so maybe 13:00-14:00 is not possible because of his block. So, perhaps Tuesday isn't the best option.\n\nSo, going back to Monday, the 14:00-15:00 slot seems possible. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nJudith is available on Monday after 12:30. Timothy is available from 14:00-15:30. So, 14:00-15:00 is a one-hour slot that works for both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 15:00-16:00, but Timothy is blocked from 15:30-17:00, so 15:00-16:00 is available.\n\nWait, no, Timothy is blocked from 15:30-17:00, so he's available from 14:00 to 15:30. So, 14:00-15:00 and 15:00-15:30 are available. But since the meeting is one hour, 14:00-15:00 is better because it's a full hour.\n\nSo, the proposed time is Monday, 14:00-15:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    work_hours = [(9, 17), (9, 17), (9, 17)]  # Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday\n    # Meeting duration\n    duration = 1\n    \n    # Available days based on Judith's preferences\n    available_days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']\n    \n    # Check each day for possible meeting times\n    for day in available_days:\n        # Convert day to numerical value for easier comparison\n        day_num = {'Monday': 0, 'Tuesday': 1, 'Wednesday': 2}[day]\n        start_time = 9 * 60\n        end_time = 17 * 60\n        \n        # Create a list of all time slots for the day\n        time_slots = []\n        for hour in range(9, 17):\n            for minute in range(0, 60):\n                time_slots.append((hour * 60 + minute, hour * 60 + minute + duration))\n        \n        # Filter time slots based on blocked times\n        available_slots = []\n        for slot in time_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            # Check if the time slot is within working hours\n            if 9 * 60 <= time_start < 17 * 60 and 9 * 60 <= time_end < 17 * 60:\n                # Check if the slot is available for both participants\n                if is_available(day_num, slot):\n                    available_slots.append(slot)\n        \n        # Find the first available slot that works for both participants\n        for slot in available_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            print(f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d}:{time_end % 60:02d} {day}\")\n            return f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d} {day}\"\n    \n    # If no slot is found, return an error message\n    return \"No available time found.\"\n\ndef is_available(day_num, slot):\n    # Check Judith's schedule\n    if day_num == 0:  # Monday\n        if slot[0] >= 12 * 60 and slot[1] <= 12 * 60 + 30:\n            return False\n    elif day_num == 2:  # Wednesday\n        if slot[0] < 12 * 60:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check Timothy's schedule\n    blocked_times = {\n        0: [(9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60),\n            (10 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60),\n            (12 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60),\n            (15 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)],\n        1: [(9 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60),\n            (13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60),\n            (14 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)],\n        2: [(9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30),\n            (10 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60),\n            (13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60 + 30),\n            (15 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30),\n            (16 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)]\n    }\n    \n    if day_num in blocked_times:\n        for start, end in blocked_times[day_num]:\n            if start <= slot[0] < end:\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
