            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Danielle, Bruce, and Eric on Monday. The meeting should last an hour, and it has to be between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. But there are some constraints. Let me see what each person's schedule looks like.\n\nFirst, Danielle has meetings from 9:00 to 10:00, then from 10:30 to 11:00, again from 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, and finally from 16:30 to 17:00. So, she's pretty busy throughout the day, especially in the afternoons.\n\nNext, Bruce has meetings at 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:30 to 16:00. So, he's got meetings spread out, but there are gaps between them that we might be able to use.\n\nEric has blocked his calendar from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, and 14:30 to 15:30. That means Eric is unavailable during those times, so the meeting can't be scheduled then.\n\nI need to find a time that works for all three. Let's break it down by time slots.\n\nStarting from 9:00, Danielle is busy until 10:00. So, the earliest we can start is 10:00. But Eric is busy from 10:00 to 11:00, so the meeting can't be in that slot.\n\nNext, Danielle is free from 11:00 to 10:30. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, no, Danielle's meetings are from 10:30 to 11:00, so she's busy during that time. So, after 10:00, the next available slot for her is after 11:00.\n\nBruce is busy from 11:00 to 11:30, so we can't start before 11:30. Eric is busy until 11:30 as well, so the meeting can't be before 11:30.\n\nLet's look at the time after 11:30. Danielle is free until 10:30, but that's before 11:30. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a timeline.\n\nFrom 9:00 to 10:00: Danielle busy, Eric busy until 9:30, then free until 10:00.\n10:00 to 10:30: Eric busy.\n10:30 to 11:00: Danielle busy, Bruce busy until 11:30.\n11:00 to 11:30: Bruce busy.\n11:30 to 13:00: Eric busy.\n13:00 to 14:00: Eric busy until 14:30.\n14:00 to 14:30: Bruce busy.\n14:30 to 15:00: Danielle busy.\n15:00 to 16:00: Bruce busy until 16:00.\n16:00 to 16:30: Danielle busy.\n16:30 to 17:00: Danielle busy.\n\nSo, the only time when all three are free is between 13:00 to 14:00. Danielle is free from 13:00 to 14:00, Bruce is free from 13:00 to 14:00, and Eric is free from 14:00 to 14:30. Wait, no, Eric is busy until 14:30. So, the latest we can start is 14:00 to finish by 15:00.\n\nBut Danielle is busy from 14:30 to 15:00, so the meeting can't be after 14:30. So, the latest start time is 14:00.\n\nLet me check if 14:00 to 15:00 works.\n\nDanielle: Free from 13:00 to 14:00, then busy until 14:30. So, 14:00 to 14:30 is her busy time. But the meeting ends at 15:00, so we can't start at 14:00 because she's busy until 14:30.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me double-check.\n\nDanielle's schedule:\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 15:30-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nBruce's schedule:\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 14:00-14:30\n- 15:30-16:00\n\nEric's schedule:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-11:00\n- 11:30-13:00\n- 14:30-15:30\n\nSo, the overlapping free times:\n\n- 9:00-10:00: Danielle busy, Eric busy\n- 10:00-10:30: Eric busy\n- 10:30-11:00: Danielle busy\n- 11:00-11:30: Bruce busy\n- 11:30-13:00: Eric busy\n- 13:00-14:00: All free\n- 14:00-14:30: Bruce busy\n- 14:30-15:00: Danielle busy\n- 15:00-15:30: Bruce busy\n- 15:30-16:00: Danielle free\n- 16:00-16:30: Danielle busy\n- 16:30-17:00: Danielle busy\n\nSo, the only slot where all three are free is 13:00-14:00. But Danielle is free from 13:00 to 14:00, Bruce is free from 13:00 to 14:00, and Eric is free from 14:00 to 14:30. Wait, no, Eric is busy until 14:30, so the latest we can start is 14:00 to finish by 15:00.\n\nBut Danielle is busy from 14:30 to 15:00, so we can't start at 14:00 because she's busy until 14:30. So, the only possible time is 13:00 to 14:00.\n\nBut let me check if that works.\n\nDanielle: 13:00-14:00 is free.\nBruce: 13:00-14:00 is free.\nEric: 14:00 is when Eric becomes free, but the meeting ends at 15:00. So, if we start at 14:00, Eric is free from 14:00 to 14:30, but Danielle is busy from 14:30 to 15:00. So, starting at 14:00 would mean Danielle is busy during part of the meeting. That's not good.\n\nSo, the only possible time is 13:00 to 14:00, but Eric is busy until 14:30. So, the meeting can't be scheduled because Eric would still be busy during part of it. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check Eric's schedule again.\n\nEric is busy from 11:30 to 13:00, and then from 14:30 to 15:30. So, from 13:00 to 14:30, Eric is free. So, if we start the meeting at 13:00, Eric is free until 14:30, which is when Danielle becomes busy again. So, the meeting would end at 14:00, which is before Eric's next meeting. So, that should work.\n\nWait, no. If the meeting is from 13:00 to 14:00, and Eric is free from 13:00 to 14:30, that's fine. So, the meeting can be scheduled from 13:00 to 14:00.\n\nBut let me confirm with all three.\n\nDanielle: 13:00-14:00 is free.\nBruce: 13:00-14:00 is free.\nEric: 13:00-14:00 is free.\n\nYes, that works. So, the meeting can be scheduled from 13:00 to 14:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\nThe meeting can be scheduled at **13:00 to 14:00** on Monday.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days):\n    # Convert schedules to time objects for easier manipulation\n    free_times = []\n    for person in participants:\n        free = []\n        for time in person:\n            start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n            end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n            free.append((start, end))\n        free_times.append(free)\n    \n    # Check each preferred day\n    for day in preferred_days:\n        day_free = True\n        for person in participants:\n            for time in person:\n                if time[0].date() == day.date():\n                    start = time[0]\n                    end = time[1]\n                    if not (end < start + meeting_duration):\n                        day_free = False\n                        break\n            if not day_free:\n                break\n        if day_free:\n            for time in participants[0]:\n                start = time[0]\n                end = time[1]\n                if start.date() == day.date() and end.date() == day.date():\n                    return f\"{start.strftime('%H:%M')}:{end.strftime('%H:%M')}: {day}\"\n    \n    # If no time found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No time found\"\n\n# Example usage\nparticipants = [\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"10:00\"),\n        (\"10:30\", \"11:00\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"15:00\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"16:00\"),\n        (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"),\n        (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"),\n        (\"14:00\", \"14:30\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"16:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n        (\"10:00\", \"11:00\"),\n        (\"11:30\", \"13:00\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"15:30\")\n    ]\n]\n\nmeeting_duration = datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\npreferred_days = [\"Monday\"]\n\nprint(find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days))\n```",
