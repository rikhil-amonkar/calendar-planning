            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for these seven people: Daniel, Kathleen, Carolyn, Roger, Cheryl, Virginia, and Angela. The meeting needs to be 30 minutes long and happen between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on Monday. \n\nFirst, I should look at everyone's schedules to see when they're available. Let me start by listing out each person's blocked times.\n\nDaniel has no meetings the whole day, so he's completely free. That's good because it gives me more flexibility.\n\nKathleen is busy from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM. So, any meeting before 2:30 PM or after 3:30 PM would work for her.\n\nCarolyn has two blocks: 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM and 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM. So, the meeting can't overlap with those times.\n\nRoger is free the entire day, which is helpful because he doesn't have any restrictions. However, the problem mentions that Roger would rather not meet before 12:30 PM. So, I need to make sure the meeting starts after 12:30 PM.\n\nCheryl is busy from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM, 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. That leaves a small window between 1:30 PM and 2:00 PM for her. \n\nVirginia is busy from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM, and 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. So, her available times are between 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM.\n\nAngela has blocks from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM, 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, and 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM. This leaves her available from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nNow, considering Roger's preference to meet after 12:30 PM, I should focus on times starting from 12:30 PM onward.\n\nLet me check the available slots after 12:30 PM:\n\n- From 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM: Let's see who's available. Daniel is free, Kathleen is free until 2:30 PM, Carolyn is busy from 1:00 PM, so no one is available after 1:00 PM. Wait, no\u2014Carolyn is busy from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM and 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM. So, between 12:30 PM and 1:00 PM, she's free. But Cheryl is busy until 1:30 PM, so the only available time is 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM. However, Angela is busy until 2:00 PM, so that slot is too early for her.\n\nWait, no\u2014Angela is busy until 2:00 PM, so 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM is okay for her? No, because she's busy from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM, but 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM is before that. Wait, no\u2014Angela's blocked times are up to 4:30 PM, so 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM is free for her. But Cheryl is busy until 1:30 PM, so the meeting can't start before 1:30 PM because Cheryl is busy until then. So, 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM isn't possible because Cheryl is busy.\n\nNext, from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM: Let's see. Daniel is free, Kathleen is free until 2:30 PM, Carolyn is free after 1:30 PM, Cheryl is free after 1:30 PM, Virginia is free from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, and Angela is free after 2:00 PM. So, this seems like a possible slot.\n\nBut wait, Angela is free after 2:00 PM, so the meeting can start at 1:30 PM. Let me check all participants:\n\n- Daniel: free\n- Kathleen: free until 2:30 PM\n- Carolyn: free after 1:30 PM\n- Roger: prefers after 12:30 PM, so this works\n- Cheryl: free after 1:30 PM\n- Virginia: free from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM\n- Angela: free after 2:00 PM\n\nSo, the meeting can start at 1:30 PM. But it needs to be 30 minutes, so it would end at 2:00 PM. However, Angela is free after 2:00 PM, but she might be busy before that. Wait, her blocked times are up to 4:30 PM, but she's free from 2:00 PM onwards. So, 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM is acceptable.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\n- Daniel: available\n- Kathleen: available\n- Carolyn: available\n- Roger: available and prefers after 12:30 PM\n- Cheryl: available\n- Virginia: available\n- Angela: available\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nAlternatively, there's another slot from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM. Let me check that:\n\n- Daniel: free\n- Kathleen: busy until 2:30 PM, so no\n- Carolyn: free after 1:30 PM\n- Roger: available\n- Cheryl: busy until 3:30 PM, so no\n- Virginia: busy until 3:30 PM, so no\n- Angela: busy until 4:30 PM, so no\n\nSo, the 2:30 PM slot isn't possible because Kathleen is busy until then.\n\nAnother slot is from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM:\n\n- Daniel: free\n- Kathleen: free after 2:30 PM\n- Carolyn: free\n- Roger: available\n- Cheryl: busy until 5:00 PM, so no\n- Virginia: busy until 4:00 PM, so no\n- Angela: free after 4:30 PM, so no\n\nSo, that slot is not possible because Cheryl and Virginia are busy.\n\nThe last slot is from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM:\n\n- Daniel: free\n- Kathleen: free\n- Carolyn: free\n- Roger: available\n- Cheryl: busy until 5:00 PM, so no\n- Virginia: busy until 5:00 PM, so no\n- Angela: free\n\nBut Cheryl and Virginia are busy until 5:00 PM, so the meeting can't be scheduled after 4:30 PM because Cheryl and Virginia are busy until then.\n\nSo, the only viable slot is from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM.\n</think>\n\nTo schedule the meeting, the available time that works for everyone is from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM on Monday.\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define the work hours for the day (Monday)\n    work_hours = [(9, 0), (17, 0)]  # (start hour, start minute), (end hour, end minute)\n\n    # Define the working day in minutes\n    work_day = 17 * 60 - 9 * 60  # 480 minutes (8 hours)\n\n    # Define the blocked times for each participant\n    daniel_blocked = []\n    kathleen_blocked = [(14, 30), (15, 30)]  # 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM\n    carolyn_blocked = [(12, 0), (13, 0)]  # 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM\n    roger_blocked = []\n    cheryl_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (10, 0),\n        (12, 30), (13, 30),\n        (14, 0), (17, 0)\n    ]\n    virginia_blocked = [\n        (9, 30), (11, 30),\n        (12, 0), (12, 30),\n        (13, 0), (13, 30),\n        (14, 30), (15, 30),\n        (16, 0), (17, 0)\n    ]\n    angela_blocked = [\n        (9, 30), (10, 0),\n        (10, 30), (11, 30),\n        (12, 0), (12, 30),\n        (13, 0), (13, 30),\n        (14, 0), (16, 30)\n    ]\n\n    # Convert blocked times to minutes for easier comparison\n    daniel_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in daniel_blocked]\n    kathleen_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in kathleen_blocked]\n    carolyn_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in carolyn_blocked]\n    roger_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in roger_blocked]\n    cheryl_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in cheryl_blocked]\n    virginia_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in virginia_blocked]\n    angela_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in angela_blocked]\n\n    # Function to check if a time is blocked by a participant\n    def is_blocked(start, end, participant):\n        # Convert start and end to minutes\n        start_min = start * 60\n        end_min = end * 60\n        # Check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n        for block_start, block_end in participant:\n            if (start_min < block_end and end_min > block_start):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible start times within work hours\n    for start_h in range(9, 17):\n        for start_m in range(0, 60):\n            start_min = start_h * 60 + start_m\n            end_min = start_min + duration\n            if end_min > 17 * 60:\n                continue  # End after work hours\n\n            # Check if this time slot is free for everyone\n            if not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, daniel_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, kathleen_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, carolyn_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, roger_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, cheryl_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, virginia_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, angela_blocked):\n                print(f\"{start_h:02}:{start_m:02}-{start_h:02}:{end_min//60:02}\")\n                print(\"Monday\")\n                return\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No available slot found\")\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
