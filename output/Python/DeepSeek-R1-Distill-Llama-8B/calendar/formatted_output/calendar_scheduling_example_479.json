            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to schedule a meeting for these seven people: Evelyn, Joshua, Kevin, Gerald, Jerry, Jesse, and Kenneth. The meeting should be one hour long between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Monday. Each person has specific time blocks when they're busy or free, except for Evelyn who is completely free the whole day. \n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's schedule to see where they're available. \n\nEvelyn is free all day, so any time is good for her. \n\nJoshua is busy from 11:00-12:30, 13:30-14:30, and 16:30-17:00. So, he's busy in the morning, midday, and late afternoon. \n\nKevin is free the entire day, so he doesn't have any constraints. \n\nGerald is also free the entire day, so no issues there. \n\nJerry has a lot of blocked times: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, and 15:30-16:00. So, he's busy in the morning, mid-morning, midday, mid-afternoon, and late afternoon. \n\nJesse is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:00, and 15:30-16:30. So, similar to Jerry but a bit later in the afternoon. \n\nKenneth is busy from 10:30-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. So, he's busy in the morning, midday, mid-afternoon, and late afternoon. \n\nI need to find a one-hour window where none of these people are busy. Since everyone except Kevin and Gerald has some busy times, the meeting can't be during any of their busy periods. \n\nLet me look for gaps in each person's schedule and see where they all have availability. \n\nStarting from 9:00, let's check each hour:\n\n- 9:00-10:00: Only Jerry is busy until 9:30, so from 9:30 onwards. Jesse is busy until 9:30. So after 9:30, the next available time.\n\nWait, at 9:00-9:30, both Jerry and Jesse are busy. So the first available slot is after 9:30. \n\nLooking at Jerry's schedule, he's busy until 10:30, so the next slot after 10:30. \n\nSimilarly, Jesse is busy until 10:30. So after 10:30, the next available time.\n\nBut wait, let me check each person's availability step by step.\n\nLet me create a timeline for each person's busy periods and then find the common free slots.\n\nEvelyn: 9:00-17:00 free.\n\nJoshua: busy 11:00-12:30, 13:30-14:30, 16:30-17:00.\n\nKevin: free all day.\n\nGerald: free all day.\n\nJerry: busy 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00.\n\nJesse: busy 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:30.\n\nKenneth: busy 10:30-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo, let's list all the busy intervals and then find the gaps.\n\nFirst, let's list all busy times:\n\n- Jerry: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00.\n\n- Jesse: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:30.\n\n- Kenneth: 10:30-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\n- Joshua: 11:00-12:30, 13:30-14:30, 16:30-17:00.\n\nNow, let's see where they are all free.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n\n- 9:00-9:30: Jerry and Jesse are busy. So no.\n\n- 9:30-10:30: Let's check each person.\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free until 11:00.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy until 10:30, so after 10:30.\n\nJesse: busy until 10:30.\n\nKenneth: busy until 10:30.\n\nSo, at 9:30-10:30, only Joshua is free, others are busy. So no.\n\nNext, after 10:30:\n\n- 10:30-11:00: Jerry is busy until 12:00, Jesse until 12:00, Kenneth until 12:30, Joshua is free until 11:00.\n\nSo, at 10:30-11:00, Joshua is free, others are busy. So no.\n\nAt 11:00-12:00:\n\n- Joshua is busy from 11:00-12:30.\n\n- Jerry is busy until 12:00.\n\n- Jesse is busy until 12:00.\n\n- Kenneth is busy until 12:30.\n\nSo, from 11:00-12:00, all are busy except perhaps after 12:00.\n\nWait, but Joshua is busy until 12:30. So after 12:30, let's check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a one-hour window where all are free.\n\nLet me try to find a slot after all their busy times.\n\nLooking at the end of the day:\n\n- 16:30-17:00: Joshua is busy until 17:00.\n\nKenneth is busy until 17:00.\n\nSo, that's busy.\n\nLooking earlier:\n\n- 14:30-15:00: Jerry, Jesse, and Kenneth are busy.\n\n- 13:30-14:00: Kenneth is busy, others?\n\nJoshua is busy from 13:30-14:30.\n\nJerry is busy from 13:30-14:00.\n\nJesse is busy from 12:30-13:00, then free until 14:30.\n\nSo, at 13:30-14:00, Joshua, Jerry, and Kenneth are busy.\n\nSo, after 14:00:\n\n- 14:00-14:30: Let's see.\n\nJerry is busy until 14:00, then free until 14:30.\n\nJesse is free until 14:30.\n\nKenneth is busy until 14:30.\n\nSo, at 14:00-14:30, only Jerry and Jesse are free, but Kenneth is busy until 14:30. So no.\n\nAfter 14:30:\n\n- 14:30-15:00: All are busy (Jerry, Jesse, Kenneth).\n\n- 15:00-15:30: Let's see.\n\nJerry is busy until 15:00, then free until 15:30.\n\nJesse is busy until 15:30.\n\nKenneth is busy until 15:30.\n\nSo, at 15:00-15:30, only Jerry is free, others are busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nAfter 15:30:\n\n- 15:30-16:00: Jerry is free until 16:00, Jesse is busy until 16:30, Kenneth is busy until 16:00.\n\nSo, at 15:30-16:00, Jerry is free, others are busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps earlier in the day.\n\nLooking between 12:00-13:00:\n\n- Let's see.\n\nAt 12:00-13:00:\n\n- Jerry is busy until 12:30, then free.\n\n- Jesse is busy until 12:30, then free.\n\n- Joshua is busy until 12:30.\n\n- Kenneth is busy until 12:30.\n\nSo, after 12:30, let's check.\n\nAt 12:30-13:00:\n\n- Jerry is free, Jesse is free, Joshua is busy until 13:30, Kenneth is busy until 13:30.\n\nSo, only Jerry and Jesse are free, others are busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nNext, after 13:00:\n\n- 13:00-13:30: Let's see.\n\nJerry is busy until 13:00, then free.\n\nJesse is busy until 13:00, then free.\n\nJoshua is busy from 13:30-14:30.\n\nKenneth is busy from 13:30-14:00.\n\nSo, at 13:00-13:30, only Jerry and Jesse are free, others are busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps between 14:00-15:00, but as before, only Jerry and Jesse are free, others are busy.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's look for times when all are free. Maybe between 12:30-13:00.\n\nAt 12:30-13:00:\n\n- Jerry is free.\n\n- Jesse is free.\n\n- Joshua is busy until 13:30.\n\n- Kenneth is busy until 13:30.\n\nSo, only two people are free. Not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps after 16:00? But no, because the meeting is one hour and ends at 17:00.\n\nWait, perhaps earlier in the day.\n\nLooking at 10:30-11:00, but only Joshua is free.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider the times when all except one are free, but since it's seven people, we need all to be free.\n\nWait, perhaps after 16:30.\n\nAt 16:30-17:00, Joshua and Kenneth are busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try to list all possible free intervals for each person and find the overlap.\n\nEvelyn: 9:00-17:00 free.\n\nJoshua: free from 9:00-11:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:30-16:30.\n\nKevin: free all day.\n\nGerald: free all day.\n\nJerry: free from 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nJesse: free from 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nKenneth: free from 9:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:30-17:00.\n\nWait, no, Kenneth's busy times are 10:30-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So his free times are 9:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo, let's list all the free intervals for each person.\n\nEvelyn: 9:00-17:00.\n\nJoshua: 9:00-11:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:30-16:30.\n\nKevin: 9:00-17:00.\n\nGerald: 9:00-17:00.\n\nJerry: 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nJesse: 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nKenneth: 9:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:30-17:00.\n\nNow, to find a time when all are free, we need a one-hour window that overlaps with all their free times.\n\nLet me look for the latest possible time to maximize the chance.\n\nLooking at the end of the day:\n\n- 16:30-17:00: Jesse is free, but Joshua and Kenneth are busy until 17:00. So no.\n\nLooking earlier:\n\n- 15:30-16:00: Jerry is free, but Jesse is busy until 16:30, Kenneth is busy until 16:00. So, only Jerry is free. Not enough.\n\n- 14:30-15:00: All are busy (Jerry, Jesse, Kenneth). So no.\n\n- 13:30-14:00: Joshua is busy, Jerry is busy, Kenneth is busy. So no.\n\n- 12:30-13:00: Let's check.\n\nJerry is free from 12:00-12:30, then busy until 13:00.\n\nWait, no. Jerry is busy from 12:30-13:00. So, at 12:30-13:00, he's busy.\n\nJesse is busy until 12:30, then free.\n\nKenneth is free from 12:30-13:00.\n\nSo, at 12:30-13:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free from 12:30-13:30.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy.\n\nJesse: busy until 12:30, then free.\n\nKenneth: free.\n\nSo, at 12:30-13:00, Jerry is busy, others are free except Joshua is free from 12:30-13:30.\n\nWait, so at 12:30-13:00, only Jerry is busy. The rest are free.\n\nSo, that's a one-hour window where all except Jerry are free. But Jerry is busy, so no.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let's check each person at 12:30-13:00.\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy until 13:00.\n\nJesse: busy until 12:30, then free.\n\nKenneth: free.\n\nSo, at 12:30-13:00, only Jerry is busy. So, not all free.\n\nSo, no.\n\nNext, looking for earlier times.\n\nLet's check 11:00-12:00.\n\nAt 11:00-12:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: busy.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy until 12:00.\n\nJesse: busy until 12:00.\n\nKenneth: busy until 12:30.\n\nSo, at 11:00-12:00, Joshua, Jerry, Jesse, and Kenneth are busy. So no.\n\nNext, 10:30-11:00.\n\nAt 10:30-11:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free until 11:00.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy until 10:30, then free.\n\nJesse: busy until 10:30, then free.\n\nKenneth: busy until 10:30, then free.\n\nSo, at 10:30-11:00, only Joshua is free. Others are busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nNext, 12:00-13:00.\n\nAt 12:00-13:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free from 12:30-13:30.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy from 12:30-13:00.\n\nJesse: busy until 12:30, then free.\n\nKenneth: free from 12:30-13:00.\n\nSo, at 12:00-12:30, Jerry and Jesse are busy. At 12:30-13:00, only Jerry is busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps 14:00-15:00.\n\nAt 14:00-15:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free from 14:30-16:30.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: free from 14:00-14:30.\n\nJesse: free from 14:30-15:00.\n\nKenneth: free from 14:00-14:30.\n\nSo, at 14:00-14:30:\n\nJerry is free, Jesse is free, Kenneth is free.\n\nBut Joshua is free from 14:30-16:30, so at 14:00-14:30, only Jerry, Jesse, and Kenneth are free, while Joshua is still busy until 13:30? Wait, no. Joshua is busy from 13:30-14:30.\n\nSo, at 14:00-14:30, Joshua is busy. So, only Jerry, Jesse, and Kenneth are free, but Joshua is busy. So, no.\n\nAfter 14:30:\n\nAt 14:30-15:00, all except Joshua are busy. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps earlier.\n\nLooking at 13:00-14:00.\n\nAt 13:00-14:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: busy until 13:30.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy until 13:00, then free.\n\nJesse: busy until 13:00, then free.\n\nKenneth: busy until 13:30.\n\nSo, at 13:00-13:30:\n\nJerry is free, Jesse is free, Kenneth is busy.\n\nJoshua is busy.\n\nSo, only Jerry and Jesse are free.\n\nAt 13:30-14:00:\n\nJerry is free, Jesse is free, Kenneth is free.\n\nJoshua is free from 13:30-14:30.\n\nSo, at 13:30-14:00, all except Joshua are free. But Joshua is busy until 14:30.\n\nSo, no.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the only possible slot is between 16:30-17:00, but Joshua and Kenneth are busy until 17:00.\n\nWait, no. At 16:30-17:00, Joshua is busy until 17:00, Kenneth is busy until 17:00. So, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a slot between 9:30-10:30.\n\nAt 9:30-10:30:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy until 10:30.\n\nJesse: busy until 10:30.\n\nKenneth: busy until 10:30.\n\nSo, only Joshua is free, others are busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps after 12:30.\n\nAt 12:30-13:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy until 13:00.\n\nJesse: busy until 12:30, then free.\n\nKenneth: free.\n\nSo, at 12:30-13:00, only Jerry is busy. So, no.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the meeting can start at 16:30, but Joshua and Kenneth are busy until 17:00, so the meeting would end at 17:00, but they are busy until then. So, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the only possible slot is between 9:30-10:30, but only Joshua is free.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe the only possible slot is between 16:30-17:00, but that's when Joshua and Kenneth are busy. So, perhaps the meeting can't be scheduled during work hours. But the problem says that there exists a solution, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in checking the busy times.\n\nLet me check each person's schedule again.\n\nJerry: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00.\n\nJesse: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:30.\n\nKenneth: 10:30-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nJoshua: 11:00-12:30, 13:30-14:30, 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo, perhaps after 16:00.\n\nAt 16:00-16:30:\n\nJerry is free from 16:00-16:30.\n\nJesse is busy until 16:30.\n\nKenneth is busy until 16:30.\n\nSo, at 16:00-16:30, Jerry is free, others are busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps between 14:30-15:00.\n\nAt 14:30-15:00:\n\nJerry is busy, Jesse is busy, Kenneth is busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, maybe between 12:00-13:00.\n\nAt 12:00-13:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free from 12:30-13:30.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy until 12:30.\n\nJesse: busy until 12:30.\n\nKenneth: free from 12:30-13:00.\n\nSo, at 12:00-12:30, Jerry and Jesse are busy.\n\nAt 12:30-13:00, only Jerry is busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the only way is to have the meeting at 9:30, but only Joshua is free. So, that's not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps the meeting can be scheduled at 10:30-11:00, but only Joshua is free.\n\nNo, that's not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the meeting can start at 16:30, but Joshua and Kenneth are busy until 17:00, so the meeting would end at 17:00, which is when they are busy. So, no.\n\nWait, maybe the meeting can be scheduled at 14:00-15:00, but at that time, Jerry, Jesse, and Kenneth are busy.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps the meeting can be scheduled at 13:00-14:00, but Joshua is busy until 13:30, Jerry is busy until 13:00, and Kenneth is busy until 13:30.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the only possible slot is between 9:30-10:30, but only Joshua is free.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should try to find the latest possible time where all are free.\n\nLooking at 16:00-16:30: only Jerry is free.\n\n16:30-17:00: Joshua and Kenneth busy.\n\n15:30-16:00: Jerry free, others busy.\n\n14:30-15:00: all busy.\n\n13:30-14:00: all busy.\n\n12:30-13:00: only Jerry busy.\n\n11:00-12:00: Joshua busy, others busy.\n\n10:30-11:00: only Joshua free.\n\n9:30-10:30: only Joshua free.\n\nWait, perhaps the only way is to have the meeting at 16:30, but that's when Joshua and Kenneth are busy. So, maybe the meeting can't be scheduled during work hours. But the problem says there's a solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the free times.\n\nLet me check each person's free times again.\n\nEvelyn: free all day.\n\nJoshua: free 9:00-11:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:30-16:30.\n\nKevin: free all day.\n\nGerald: free all day.\n\nJerry: free 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nJesse: free 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nKenneth: free 9:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:30-17:00.\n\nWait, so perhaps the meeting can be scheduled at 12:30-13:00, but at that time, Jerry is busy until 13:00, Jesse is busy until 12:30, and Kenneth is free.\n\nSo, at 12:30-13:00, only Jerry is busy.\n\nBut we need all to be free.\n\nWait, perhaps the meeting can be scheduled at 14:00-15:00, but at that time, Jerry, Jesse, and Kenneth are busy.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps the meeting can be scheduled at 15:30-16:00, but Jerry is free, Jesse is busy until 16:30, Kenneth is busy until 16:00.\n\nSo, only Jerry is free.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the meeting can start at 16:30, but that's when Joshua and Kenneth are busy.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the only possible slot is between 9:30-10:30, but only Joshua is free.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a time when all have a free slot.\n\nLooking at the free times:\n\nEvelyn: all day.\n\nJoshua: 9:00-11:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:30-16:30.\n\nKevin: all day.\n\nGerald: all day.\n\nJerry: 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nJesse: 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nKenneth: 9:00-10:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo, looking for a time when all are free.\n\nLet me check 16:30-17:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free until 16:30.\n\nWait, Joshua is busy from 16:30-17:00. So, no.\n\nKenneth: busy until 17:00.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps 14:30-15:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy.\n\nJesse: busy.\n\nKenneth: busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps 12:30-13:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy until 13:00.\n\nJesse: busy until 12:30.\n\nKenneth: free.\n\nSo, at 12:30-13:00, only Jerry is busy.\n\nSo, no.\n\nWait, perhaps 10:30-11:00:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: busy until 10:30.\n\nJesse: busy until 10:30.\n\nKenneth: busy until 10:30.\n\nSo, only Joshua is free.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps 14:00-14:30:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: free.\n\nJesse: free until 14:30.\n\nKenneth: free.\n\nSo, at 14:00-14:30, all are free except Jesse, who is free until 14:30.\n\nWait, no, Jesse is free from 14:30-15:00, so at 14:00-14:30, Jesse is busy until 14:30.\n\nWait, no, Jesse is busy from 14:30-15:00, so at 14:00-14:30, he's free.\n\nWait, no, Jesse's schedule is busy from 14:30-15:00, so at 14:00-14:30, he's free.\n\nSimilarly, Kenneth is free from 14:00-14:30.\n\nSo, at 14:00-14:30, all are free.\n\nWait, let me check each person:\n\nEvelyn: free.\n\nJoshua: free from 14:30-16:30, so at 14:00-14:30, he's free.\n\nKevin: free.\n\nGerald: free.\n\nJerry: free from 14:00-14:30.\n\nJesse: free from 14:00-14:30 (since he's busy from 14:30-15:00).\n\nKenneth: free from 14:00-14:30.\n\nSo, yes! At 14:00-14:30, all are free.\n\nThat's a one-hour window where everyone is available.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 14:00 to 15:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(schedules, duration, day_of_week):\n    # Convert day of week to Monday\n    if day_of_week == 'Tuesday':\n        day = datetime.date.weekday(datetime.date.today()) + 1\n    else:\n        day = datetime.date.weekday(datetime.date.today())\n    \n    # Check if today is the correct day\n    if datetime.date.today().weekday() != day:\n        return \"No meeting possible on the specified day.\"\n    \n    # Define the meeting duration\n    start_time = datetime.time(9, 0)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17, 0)\n    \n    # Convert schedules to time ranges\n    all_busy = []\n    for person in schedules:\n        busy = []\n        for time in person:\n            if time[0] > start_time:\n                if time[0] - time[1] > datetime.timedelta(hours=1):\n                    busy.append((time[0], time[1]))\n        all_busy.append(busy)\n    \n    # Find the latest possible meeting time\n    for hour in range(17, 9, -1):\n        for minute in range(0, 60):\n            start = datetime.time(hour, minute)\n            end = datetime.time(hour + 1, minute)\n            # Check if all are free\n            conflict = False\n            for i in range(len(all_busy)):\n                # Check if the time is within any busy period\n                for b in all_busy[i]:\n                    if b[0] <= start < b[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if not conflict:\n                return f\"{hour:02}:{minute:02}:{hour+1:02}:{minute:02} {day_of_week}\"\n    \n    return \"No meeting possible within the given constraints.\"\n\n# Example usage:\n# schedules = {\n#     \"Evelyn\": [],\n#     \"Joshua\": [(11, 30), (12, 30), (13, 30), (14, 30), (16, 30)],\n#     \"Kevin\": [],\n#     \"Gerald\": [],\n#     \"Jerry\": [(9, 30), (10, 30), (12, 0), (12, 30), (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30), (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30)],\n#     \"Jesse\": [(9, 30), (10, 30), (12, 0), (12, 30), (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 30), (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 30)],\n#     \"Kenneth\": [(10, 30), (12, 30), (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30), (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 30)]\n# }\n# print(find_meeting_time(schedules, 1, \"Monday\"))\n```",
