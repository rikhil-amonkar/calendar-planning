            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to help schedule a meeting for Lisa, Bobby, and Randy on Monday from 9 AM to 5 PM. Each of them has their own schedule constraints, and Bobby has a specific preference to avoid meetings after 3 PM. I need to find a half-hour slot that works for all three without overlapping any of their existing meetings.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's busy times:\n\n- **Lisa** is busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:30-13:00, and 16:00-16:30.\n- **Bobby** is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, and 15:00-15:30.\n- **Randy** has meetings from 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nBobby's preference is to avoid meetings after 15:00, so any time slot after 3 PM needs to be checked carefully.\n\nNext, I'll convert these times into minute intervals to make it easier to check for overlaps.\n\nFor **Lisa**:\n- 9:00-10:00 \u2192 540-600 minutes\n- 10:30-11:30 \u2192 630-690 minutes\n- 12:30-13:00 \u2192 750-780 minutes\n- 16:00-16:30 \u2192 960-990 minutes\n\nFor **Bobby**:\n- 9:00-9:30 \u2192 540-570 minutes\n- 10:00-10:30 \u2192 600-630 minutes\n- 11:30-12:00 \u2192 690-720 minutes\n- 15:00-15:30 \u2192 900-930 minutes\n\nFor **Randy**:\n- 9:30-10:00 \u2192 570-600 minutes\n- 10:30-11:00 \u2192 630-660 minutes\n- 11:30-12:30 \u2192 690-750 minutes\n- 13:00-13:30 \u2192 780-810 minutes\n- 14:30-15:30 \u2192 870-900 minutes\n- 16:00-16:30 \u2192 960-990 minutes\n\nNow, I need to check each minute from 9:00 to 16:30 (570 minutes to 990 minutes) to find a half-hour slot where none of them are busy.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n\n- 540-570: Bobby is busy until 570, so no.\n- 570-600: Randy is busy until 600, so no.\n- 600-630: Bobby is busy until 630, so no.\n- 630-660: Randy is busy until 660, so no.\n- 660-690: Both Bobby and Randy are busy until 690, so no.\n- 690-720: Bobby is busy until 720, so no.\n- 720-750: Let's see, Lisa is free from 720-750, but Bobby is busy until 720, so no.\n- 750-780: Lisa is busy until 780, so no.\n- 780-810: Randy is busy until 810, so no.\n- 810-840: Free time. Let's check if this works for everyone.\n  - Lisa is free from 810-840.\n  - Bobby is free from 810-840.\n  - Randy is free from 810-840.\n  - Duration is 30 minutes, so 810-840 is a suitable slot.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure that this slot doesn't overlap with any of their busy times. From 810-840, none of them have any meetings, so this should work.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\n- Lisa: Free from 810-840.\n- Bobby: Free from 810-840.\n- Randy: Free from 810-840.\n\nYes, this slot works. So the meeting can be scheduled from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM on Monday.\n\nHowever, I should also consider Bobby's preference to avoid meetings after 15:00. Since this slot is before 15:00, it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the suitable time is 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\n'''python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Convert start time to datetime.time object\n    start_time = datetime.time(9)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17)\n\n    # Define each person's busy intervals\n    lisa_busy = [\n        (9, 0), (10, 30), (12, 30), (16, 0)\n    ]\n    bobby_busy = [\n        (9, 0), (10, 30), (11, 30), (15, 0)\n    ]\n    randy_busy = [\n        (9, 30), (10, 30), (11, 30), (13, 0), (14, 30), (16, 0)\n    ]\n\n    # Convert busy intervals to time ranges\n    def convert_intervals(intervals):\n        all_time = set()\n        for h, m in intervals:\n            start = datetime.time(h, m)\n            end = start + datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)\n            all_time.add(start)\n            all_time.add(end)\n        return all_time\n\n    lisa_busy = convert_intervals(lisa_busy)\n    bobby_busy = convert_intervals(bobby_busy)\n    randy_busy = convert_intervals(randy_busy)\n\n    # Check each minute from start_time to end_time - duration\n    for minute in range(start_time.hour * 60, end_time.hour * 60 + 1):\n        current = datetime.time(minute // 60, minute % 60)\n        end = current + datetime.timedelta(minutes=duration)\n        end_time = end.time()\n\n        # Check if current minute is free for everyone\n        if (current not in lisa_busy and\n            current not in bobby_busy and\n            current not in randy_busy):\n            # Check if the entire duration fits in the day\n            if end_time <= datetime.time(17, 0):\n                return f\"{current.hour:02d}:{current.minute:02d} to {end.hour:02d}:{end.minute:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no slot found (shouldn't happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No suitable time found\"\n\n# Get the result\nresult = find_meeting_time()\nprint(f\"{result}\")\n'''",
