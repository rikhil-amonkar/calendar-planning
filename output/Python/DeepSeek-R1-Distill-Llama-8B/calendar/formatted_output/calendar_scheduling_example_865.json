            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help Megan and Daniel find a time to meet for an hour between 9 AM and 5 PM on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Both of them have pretty busy schedules, so I need to carefully look at their calendars to find a common free slot.\n\nFirst, I'll start by listing out Megan's busy times. She has meetings on Monday from 1 PM to 1:30 PM and 2 PM to 3:30 PM. On Tuesday, she's busy from 9 AM to 9:30 AM and 12 PM to 12:30 PM, and from 4 PM to 5 PM. On Wednesday, she has meetings from 9:30 AM to 10 AM and 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM, as well as from 12:30 PM to 2 PM and 4 PM to 4:30 PM. On Thursday, she's busy from 1:30 PM to 2 PM and 3 PM to 3:30 PM.\n\nNow, looking at Daniel's schedule, he's busy on Monday from 10 AM to 11:30 AM, 12:30 PM to 3 PM, and on Tuesday from 9 AM to 10 AM, 10:30 AM to 5 PM. On Wednesday, he's busy from 9 AM to 10 AM, 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM, and from 12 PM to 5 PM. On Thursday, he's busy from 9 AM to 12 PM, 12:30 PM to 2 PM, 3 PM to 4:30 PM, and from 5 PM to 6 PM.\n\nI need to find a time where both Megan and Daniel are free. Since they want to meet as early as possible, I'll check each day starting from Monday.\n\nOn Monday, Megan is free from 9 AM to 10 AM, but Daniel is busy from 10 AM to 11:30 AM. So, the latest they can start on Monday is 9:30 AM, but Megan's first meeting starts at 1 PM, so after 9:30 AM, Megan is free until 1 PM, but Daniel is busy until 10:30 AM. So, maybe around 10:30 AM, but Megan is busy from 1 PM to 3:30 PM, so that doesn't work.\n\nOn Tuesday, Megan is free from 9 AM to 9:30 AM and 12 PM to 12:30 PM and 5 PM to 6 PM. Daniel is busy from 9 AM to 10 AM, 10:30 AM to 5 PM, and 5 PM to 6 PM. So, the only overlapping free time is after 5 PM, but Megan is free from 5 PM to 6 PM, but Daniel is busy until 6 PM. So, that doesn't work either.\n\nOn Wednesday, Megan is free from 9:30 AM to 10 AM and 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM and 3 PM to 4:30 PM. Daniel is busy from 9 AM to 10 AM, 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM, and 12 PM to 5 PM. So, the overlapping free time is from 3 PM to 4:30 PM. That seems to work because Megan is free from 3 PM to 4:30 PM, and Daniel is free from 3 PM to 5 PM.\n\nOn Thursday, Megan is free from 9 AM to 9:30 AM and 2 PM to 3 PM and 4:30 PM to 5 PM. Daniel is busy from 9 AM to 12 PM, 12:30 PM to 2 PM, and 3 PM to 4:30 PM. So, the overlapping free time is from 2 PM to 3 PM, but Megan is free from 2 PM to 3 PM, and Daniel is busy until 3 PM. So, that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the earliest available time is on Wednesday from 3 PM to 4:30 PM.\n</think>\n\n```python\n'''python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    duration = 60  # 60 minutes\n\n    # Convert start time to datetime.time object\n    start_time = datetime.time(9)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17)\n\n    # Define each person's busy intervals\n    megan_busy = [\n        (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30), (15, 0), (15, 30),\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (12, 0), (12, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30),\n        (9, 30), (10, 0), (10, 30), (11, 30), (12, 0), (12, 30),\n        (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30), (15, 0), (15, 30),\n        (16, 0), (16, 30), (17, 0), (17, 30)\n    ]\n    daniel_busy = [\n        (10, 0), (10, 30), (11, 30), (12, 30), (13, 0), (13, 30),\n        (14, 0), (14, 30), (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30),\n        (17, 0), (17, 30),\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (10, 0), (10, 30), (11, 0), (11, 30),\n        (12, 0), (12, 30), (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30),\n        (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30), (17, 0), (17, 30),\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (10, 0), (10, 30), (11, 0), (11, 30),\n        (12, 0), (12, 30), (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30),\n        (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30), (17, 0), (17, 30),\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (10, 0), (10, 30), (11, 0), (11, 30),\n        (12, 0), (12, 30), (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30),\n        (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30), (17, 0), (17, 30),\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (10, 0), (10, 30), (11, 0), (11, 30),\n        (12, 0), (12, 30), (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30),\n        (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30), (17, 0), (17, 30)\n    ]\n\n    # Convert busy intervals to time ranges\n    def convert_intervals(intervals):\n        all_time = set()\n        for h, m in intervals:\n            start = datetime.time(h, m)\n            end = start + datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)\n            all_time.add(start)\n            all_time.add(end)\n        return all_time\n\n    megan_busy = convert_intervals(megan_busy)\n    daniel_busy = convert_intervals(daniel_busy)\n\n    # Check each day from Monday to Thursday\n    for day in [datetime.weekday(), datetime.weekday() + 1, datetime.weekday() + 2, datetime.weekday() + 3]:\n        current_day = datetime.date.fromisoformat('2023-10-09') + datetime.timedelta(days=day)\n        start_day = current_day.replace(hour=9, minute=0)\n        end_day = current_day.replace(hour=17, minute=0)\n\n        # Check each minute from start_time to end_time - duration\n        for minute in range(start_day.hour * 60, end_day.hour * 60 + 1):\n            current = datetime.time(minute // 60, minute % 60)\n            end = current + datetime.timedelta(minutes=duration)\n            end_time = end.time()\n\n            # Check if current minute is free for both\n            if (current not in megan_busy and\n                current not in daniel_busy):\n                # Check if the entire duration fits in the day\n                if end_time <= datetime.time(17, 0):\n                    return f\"{current.hour:02d}:{current.minute:02d} to {end.hour:02d}:{end.minute:02d} on {current_day.weekday():02d} days\"\n\n    # If no slot found (shouldn't happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No suitable time found\"\n\n# Get the result\nresult = find_meeting_time()\nprint(f\"{result}\")\n'''",
