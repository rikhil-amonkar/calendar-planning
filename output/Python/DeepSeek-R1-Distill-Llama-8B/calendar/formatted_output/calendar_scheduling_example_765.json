The meeting should be half an hour long, and it needs to be between 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. \n\nFirst, I should look at their schedules to see when they're available. Joshua has meetings on Monday from 15:00 to 15:30 and on Tuesday from 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, and 14:30 to 15:00. So, Joshua is busy during those times, and I need to find a time outside of these periods for a half-hour meeting.\n\nJoyce is busier. She's booked on Monday from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 17:00. On Tuesday, she's busy from 9:00 to 17:00, which means the entire day is blocked. On Wednesday, she's busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nJoyce also has a preference: she would rather not meet on Monday before 12:00. So, Monday mornings before 12:00 are off the table.\n\nGiven that Joyce is fully booked on Tuesday, the meeting can't be on Tuesday. That leaves Monday and Wednesday.\n\nLooking at Monday, Joyce is available from 12:00 to 13:00, 15:00 to 15:30, and 17:00 to 17:30. But she prefers not meeting before 12:00, so the earliest available time on Monday is 12:00.\n\nJoshua on Monday is busy from 15:00 to 15:30. So, the time from 15:30 to 16:00 might be available for Joshua, but Joyce is busy until 17:00. So, that might not work.\n\nOn Wednesday, Joyce is available from 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:30 to 17:00. Joshua doesn't have any meetings on Wednesday, so any time on Wednesday should work for him.\n\nLooking for a half-hour slot, the latest possible start time would be 16:30, but that's only 30 minutes. However, Joyce is available from 16:30 to 17:00, but Joshua doesn't have any meetings after 15:30 on Wednesday.\n\nSo, the latest possible time is 16:30, but that's only a 30-minute slot. Alternatively, maybe 15:30 to 16:00, but I need to check if that's available for both.\n\nWait, Joshua doesn't have any meetings on Wednesday, so any time should work for him. Joyce is available on Wednesday from 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nSo, the latest possible start time is 16:30, but that's only 30 minutes. Alternatively, 15:30 to 16:00, but I need to see if that's available.\n\nWait, 15:30 to 16:00 is a 30-minute slot. Let me check if that works for both.\n\nJoshua is not busy then, and Joyce is available from 15:00 to 15:30 and 15:30 to 16:00. So, 15:30 to 16:00 is available for Joyce.\n\nTherefore, a suitable time would be 15:30 to 16:00 on Wednesday.\n\nBut wait, the user said Joyce prefers not meeting on Monday before 12:00, but didn't say anything about Wednesday. So, Wednesday is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the meeting can be scheduled for 15:30 to 16:00 on Wednesday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    work_hours = [(9, 17), (9, 17), (9, 17)]  # Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday\n    # Meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n    \n    # Available days based on Joyce's preferences\n    available_days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']\n    \n    # Check each day for possible meeting times\n    for day in available_days:\n        # Convert day to numerical value for easier comparison\n        day_num = {'Monday': 0, 'Tuesday': 1, 'Wednesday': 2}[day]\n        start_time = 9 * 60\n        end_time = 17 * 60\n        \n        # Create a list of all time slots for the day\n        time_slots = []\n        for hour in range(9, 17):\n            for minute in range(0, 60):\n                time_slots.append((hour * 60 + minute, hour * 60 + minute + duration))\n        \n        # Filter time slots based on blocked times\n        available_slots = []\n        for slot in time_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            # Check if the time slot is within working hours\n            if 9 * 60 <= time_start < 17 * 60 and 9 * 60 <= time_end < 17 * 60:\n                # Check if the slot is available for both participants\n                if is_available(day_num, slot):\n                    available_slots.append(slot)\n        \n        # Find the first available slot that works for both participants\n        for slot in available_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            print(f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d}:{time_end % 60:02d} {day}\")\n            return f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d} {day}\"\n    \n    # If no slot is found, return an error message\n    return \"No available time found.\"\n\ndef is_available(day_num, slot):\n    # Check Joshua's schedule\n    blocked_joshua = {\n        0: [(15 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30)],  # Monday\n        1: [(11 * 60, 12 * 60), (13 * 60, 13 * 60 + 30), (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60)]  # Tuesday\n    }\n    \n    if day_num in blocked_joshua:\n        for start, end in blocked_joshua[day_num]:\n            if start <= slot[0] < end:\n                return False\n    \n    # Check Joyce's schedule\n    blocked_joyce = {\n        0: [(9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30), (10 * 60, 11 * 60), (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60 + 30), \n            (13 * 60, 15 * 60), (15 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)],  # Monday\n        1: [(9 * 60, 17 * 60)],  # Tuesday is fully blocked\n        2: [(9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30), (10 * 60, 11 * 60), (12 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60 + 30), \n            (16 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)]  # Wednesday\n    }\n    \n    if day_num in blocked_joyce:\n        for start, end in blocked_joyce[day_num]:\n            if start <= slot[0] < end:\n                return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
