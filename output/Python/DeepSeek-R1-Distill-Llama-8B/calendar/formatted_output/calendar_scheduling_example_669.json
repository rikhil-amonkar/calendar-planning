            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting between Jean and Doris. The meeting should last half an hour, and it can be on either Monday or Tuesday. Let me look at their schedules first.\n\nJean is busy on Tuesday from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM. So on Tuesday, those times are taken. On Monday, Jean isn't mentioned, so I guess she's available unless there are other constraints.\n\nDoris has a lot more meetings. On Monday, she's busy from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM, then from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM, and from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM. That covers most of Monday. She's also busy every day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Tuesday. But there's a constraint that she doesn't want to meet on Monday after 2:00 PM. So after 2:00 PM on Monday, that's not ideal for her.\n\nSo I need to find a time that works for both. Let's check Monday first. On Monday, Doris is busy until 1:30 PM, then from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. But she doesn't want to meet after 2:00 PM. So the latest she can meet on Monday is 1:30 PM. But let's see if that works with Jean.\n\nJean isn't busy on Monday, so theoretically, they could meet any time except where Jean is busy on Tuesday. Wait, no, the meeting can be on either Monday or Tuesday. So if I choose Monday, I need to make sure it's before 2:00 PM for Doris.\n\nBut let's check Tuesday. On Tuesday, Jean is busy from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM. So on Tuesday, the possible times would be before 11:30 AM or after 4:30 PM.\n\nBut Doris is busy from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Tuesday, so the only possible time on Tuesday would be before 11:30 AM or after 4:30 PM. However, the meeting is half an hour, so if they meet after 4:30 PM, that might be too late or conflicting with Doris's schedule.\n\nWait, no, Doris is busy until 5:00 PM on Tuesday, so after 4:30 PM is also busy. So on Tuesday, the only available time is before 11:30 AM.\n\nSo let's check if there's a time before 11:30 AM on Tuesday that works for both. But let's also consider Monday.\n\nOn Monday, before 9:00 AM, but work hours start at 9:00 AM. So the earliest they can meet is 9:00 AM. But Doris is busy from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM, so they can't meet during that time.\n\nWait, no, the meeting is half an hour. So if they start at 9:00 AM, they'd end at 9:30 AM. But Doris is busy from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM. So 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM is within her busy time. So that won't work.\n\nThe next available time on Monday after her busy periods is after 1:30 PM but before 2:00 PM, but she doesn't want to meet after 2:00 PM. So the latest they can meet on Monday is 1:30 PM.\n\nSo on Monday, the possible time is between 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM (but Doris is busy) and after 1:30 PM but before 2:00 PM (since she doesn't want to meet after 2:00 PM). So the only possible time on Monday is between 1:30 PM and 2:00 PM.\n\nBut let's check if Jean is available on Monday. Jean isn't busy on Monday, so that's fine.\n\nSo the meeting could be on Monday at 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM.\n\nAlternatively, on Tuesday, they can meet before 11:30 AM. Let's see if that works.\n\nOn Tuesday, before 11:30 AM, both Jean and Doris are available. So the earliest they can meet is 9:00 AM, but let's check if that's possible.\n\nIf they start at 9:00 AM, they end at 9:30 AM. That's within Doris's busy time from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM. So that's not possible.\n\nThe next available time on Tuesday is after 11:30 AM but before 4:00 PM. But Jean is busy from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, so they can't meet during that time.\n\nAfter 12:00 PM, Doris is busy until 4:00 PM. So the next available time is after 4:00 PM, but she's busy until 5:00 PM. So the only time on Tuesday is before 11:30 AM, but that's conflicting with her busy time.\n\nWait, no. On Tuesday, Doris is busy from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. So the only time they can meet is before 9:00 AM, which is outside work hours, or after 5:00 PM, which is also outside work hours.\n\nSo the only viable option is on Monday at 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM.\n\nTherefore, the best time to schedule the meeting is Monday at 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM.\n</think>\n\n```python\nparticipants = [\n    {'name': 'Jean', 'blocks': [(330, 360), (960, 990)]},  # Tuesday 11:30-12:00 and 16:00-16:30\n    {'name': 'Doris', 'blocks': [(0, 90), (180, 210), (270, 300), (690, 750), (870, 900), (930, 960), (990, 1020)]}  # Monday: 9:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00; Tuesday: 9:00-17:00\n]\n\nday_options = ['Monday', 'Tuesday']\n\nfor day in day_options:\n    if day == 'Monday':\n        start_times = [900, 1050, 1170, 1260, 1380, 1500, 1710]\n    elif day == 'Tuesday':\n        start_times = [540, 630, 690, 780, 870, 960, 1050]\n    \n    for start in start_times:\n        slot = (start, start + 30)\n        conflict = False\n        for participant in participants:\n            for block in participant['blocks']:\n                if not (block[1] < slot[0] or block[0] > slot[1]):\n                    conflict = True\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                break\n        if not conflict:\n            print(f\"{start//30:02d}:{start%30:02d}-{(start+30)//30:02d}:{(start+30)%30:02d} {day}\")\n            exit()\n```",
