            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help schedule a meeting for seven people: Gregory, Jonathan, Barbara, Jesse, Alan, Nicole, and Catherine. The meeting needs to be half an hour long and can take place between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on Monday. Each person has their own schedule conflicts, and some have specific preferences about when they don't want to meet.\n\nFirst, I'll start by listing out everyone's blocked times and see where there's an overlap where no one has a meeting. But with seven people, this could get complicated. Maybe I should create a timeline and mark all the busy periods for each person.\n\nLet me jot down each person's blocked times:\n\n- **Gregory**: 9:00-9:30 AM and 11:30-12:00 PM.\n- **Jonathan**: 9:00-9:30 AM, 12:00-12:30 PM, 1:00-1:30 PM, 3:00-4:00 PM, and 4:30-5:00 PM.\n- **Barbara**: 10:00-10:30 AM and 1:30-2:00 PM.\n- **Jesse**: 10:00-11:00 AM and 12:30-2:30 PM.\n- **Alan**: 9:30-11:00 AM, 11:30-12:30 PM, 1:00-3:30 PM, and 4:00-5:00 PM.\n- **Nicole**: 9:00-10:30 AM, 11:30-12:00 PM, 12:30-1:30 PM, 2:00-5:00 PM.\n- **Catherine**: 9:00-10:30 AM, 12:00-1:30 PM, 3:00-3:30 PM, and 4:00-4:30 PM.\n\nLooking at these, I can see that the morning hours are pretty busy. Maybe the best time to schedule the meeting is in the late morning or early afternoon.\n\nI'll start checking from 10:00 AM onward. Let's see:\n\n- **10:00 AM**: Gregory is free until 9:30, but wait, Gregory is blocked from 9:00-9:30. After that, he's free until 11:30. So 10:00 AM is after his blocked time. But let's check others.\n\nBarbara is busy from 10:00-10:30, so 10:00 is out.\n\nJesse is busy until 11:00, so 10:30 might be available.\n\nNicole is busy until 10:30, so 10:30 is out.\n\nCatherine is busy until 10:30, so 10:30 is out.\n\nSo, 10:30 AM seems too early because multiple people are busy.\n\nLet's try 11:00 AM.\n\n- **11:00 AM**: Gregory is free until 11:30, so that's good.\n\nJonathan is busy from 12:00-12:30, so 11:00 is okay.\n\nBarbara is free after 10:30, so 11:00 is okay.\n\nJesse is busy until 11:00, so 11:00 is just the end of his meeting. Maybe he's available at 11:00.\n\nAlan is busy until 11:30, so 11:00 is just before his meeting.\n\nNicole is busy until 11:30, so 11:00 is okay.\n\nCatherine is busy until 12:00, so 11:00 is okay.\n\nSo, 11:00 AM seems possible. But let's check until when.\n\n- **11:30 AM**: Gregory is busy from 11:30-12:00, so that's out.\n\nSo, the latest we can start at 11:00 AM is until 11:30 AM.\n\nWait, the meeting is half an hour, so it needs to end by 12:00 PM.\n\nBut let's see if everyone is free from 11:00-11:30 AM.\n\n- **11:00-11:30 AM**:\n\n  - Gregory: Free (blocked until 11:30)\n  - Jonathan: Free (blocked until 12:00)\n  - Barbara: Free (blocked until 10:30)\n  - Jesse: Free (blocked until 11:00)\n  - Alan: Free (blocked until 11:30)\n  - Nicole: Free (blocked until 11:30)\n  - Catherine: Free (blocked until 12:00)\n\nSo, 11:00-11:30 AM seems to work. But let's check if there's a later slot that works.\n\nNext possible slot could be after 12:00 PM.\n\n- **12:00 PM**: Let's see.\n\nGregory is free after 11:30, so 12:00 is okay.\n\nJonathan is busy from 12:00-12:30, so 12:00 is out.\n\nBarbara is free after 10:30, so 12:00 is okay.\n\nJesse is free after 11:00, so 12:00 is okay.\n\nAlan is free after 11:30, so 12:00 is okay.\n\nNicole is free after 11:30, so 12:00 is okay.\n\nCatherine is free after 12:00, so 12:00 is okay.\n\nBut Jonathan is busy from 12:00-12:30, so the meeting can't start at 12:00.\n\nThe next available time after 12:00 would be 12:30 PM.\n\n- **12:30 PM**:\n\n  - Gregory: Free (blocked until 11:30)\n  - Jonathan: Free (blocked until 12:30)\n  - Barbara: Free (blocked until 10:30)\n  - Jesse: Free (blocked until 11:00)\n  - Alan: Free (blocked until 11:30)\n  - Nicole: Free (blocked until 11:30)\n  - Catherine: Free (blocked until 12:00)\n\nSo, 12:30 PM seems okay. But let's check the duration.\n\n- **12:30-1:00 PM**: End at 1:00 PM.\n\nIs everyone free until 1:00 PM?\n\n- **1:00 PM**: Let's check.\n\nGregory: Free until 11:30, so 1:00 PM is okay.\n\nJonathan: Free until 12:30, so 1:00 PM is okay.\n\nBarbara: Free until 10:30, so 1:00 PM is okay.\n\nJesse: Free until 11:00, so 1:00 PM is okay.\n\nAlan: Free until 11:30, so 1:00 PM is okay.\n\nNicole: Free until 11:30, so 1:00 PM is okay.\n\nCatherine: Free until 12:00, so 1:00 PM is okay.\n\nSo, 12:30-1:00 PM seems to work.\n\nBut let's check if there's a later slot.\n\n- **1:00 PM**: Let's see.\n\nGregory: Free (blocked until 11:30)\nJonathan: Free (blocked until 12:30)\nBarbara: Free (blocked until 10:30)\nJesse: Free (blocked until 11:00)\nAlan: Free (blocked until 11:30)\nNicole: Free (blocked until 11:30)\nCatherine: Free (blocked until 12:00)\n\nSo, 1:00 PM is okay. But the meeting needs to be half an hour, so it would end at 1:30 PM.\n\n- **1:30 PM**: Let's check.\n\nGregory: Free until 11:30\nJonathan: Free until 12:30\nBarbara: Free until 10:30\nJesse: Free until 11:00\nAlan: Free until 11:30\nNicole: Free until 11:30\nCatherine: Free until 12:00\n\nSo, 1:30 PM seems okay. But let's check if everyone is free until 2:00 PM.\n\n- **2:00 PM**: Let's check.\n\nGregory: Free until 11:30\nJonathan: Free until 12:30\nBarbara: Free until 10:30\nJesse: Free until 11:00\nAlan: Free until 11:30\nNicole: Free until 11:30\nCatherine: Free until 12:00\n\nSo, 2:00 PM is okay. But the meeting would end at 2:30 PM.\n\n- **2:30 PM**: Let's check.\n\nGregory: Free until 11:30\nJonathan: Free until 12:30\nBarbara: Free until 10:30\nJesse: Free until 11:00\nAlan: Free until 11:30\nNicole: Free until 11:30\nCatherine: Free until 12:00\n\nSo, 2:30 PM seems okay. But let's check if there's a later slot.\n\n- **3:00 PM**: Let's check.\n\nGregory: Free until 11:30\nJonathan: Free until 12:30\nBarbara: Free until 10:30\nJesse: Free until 11:00\nAlan: Free until 11:30\nNicole: Free until 11:30\nCatherine: Free until 12:00\n\nSo, 3:00 PM is okay. The meeting would end at 3:30 PM.\n\n- **3:30 PM**: Let's check.\n\nGregory: Free until 11:30\nJonathan: Free until 12:30\nBarbara: Free until 10:30\nJesse: Free until 11:00\nAlan: Free until 11:30\nNicole: Free until 11:30\nCatherine: Free until 12:00\n\nSo, 3:30 PM seems okay. But let's check if there's a later slot.\n\n- **4:00 PM**: Let's check.\n\nGregory: Free until 11:30\nJonathan: Free until 12:30\nBarbara: Free until 10:30\nJesse: Free until 11:00\nAlan: Free until 11:30\nNicole: Free until 11:30\nCatherine: Free until 12:00\n\nSo, 4:00 PM is okay. The meeting would end at 4:30 PM.\n\n- **4:30 PM**: Let's check.\n\nGregory: Free until 11:30\nJonathan: Free until 12:30\nBarbara: Free until 10:30\nJesse: Free until 11:00\nAlan: Free until 11:30\nNicole: Free until 11:30\nCatherine: Free until 12:00\n\nSo, 4:30 PM seems okay. But let's check if there's a later slot.\n\n- **5:00 PM**: Let's check.\n\nGregory: Free until 11:30\nJonathan: Free until 12:30\nBarbara: Free until 10:30\nJesse: Free until 11:00\nAlan: Free until 11:30\nNicole: Free until 11:30\nCatherine: Free until 12:00\n\nSo, 5:00 PM is okay. But the meeting would end at 5:30 PM, which is after work hours. So, we need to end by 5:00 PM.\n\nLooking back, the earliest available slot is 11:00-11:30 AM. But let's see if there's a later slot that everyone can attend.\n\nWait, I think I missed something. Let me double-check.\n\nAt 12:30 PM, everyone is free until 1:00 PM. So, 12:30-1:00 PM is a valid slot.\n\nSimilarly, 1:00-1:30 PM is also free.\n\nBut I need to find the earliest availability. So, 11:00-11:30 AM seems to be the earliest.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with everyone's schedules again.\n\n- **11:00-11:30 AM**:\n\n  - Gregory: Free (blocked until 11:30)\n  - Jonathan: Free (blocked until 12:00)\n  - Barbara: Free (blocked until 10:30)\n  - Jesse: Free (blocked until 11:00)\n  - Alan: Free (blocked until 11:30)\n  - Nicole: Free (blocked until 11:30)\n  - Catherine: Free (blocked until 12:00)\n\nYes, everyone is free during this slot. So, 11:00-11:30 AM is a valid meeting time.\n\nBut the user mentioned that Denise does not want to meet on Monday after 12:30. Wait, in this case, it's Monday, and the meeting is before 12:30, so that's okay.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled at 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM on Monday.\n</think>\n\nThe meeting can be scheduled at 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM on Monday.\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define the work hours for the day (Monday)\n    work_hours = [(9, 0), (17, 0)]  # (start hour, start minute), (end hour, end minute)\n\n    # Define the working day in minutes\n    work_day = 17 * 60 - 9 * 60  # 480 minutes (8 hours)\n\n    # Define the blocked times for each participant\n    gregory_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30),  # 9:00-9:30 AM\n        (11, 30), (12, 0)  # 11:30-12:00 PM\n    ]\n    jonathan_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30),  # 9:00-9:30 AM\n        (12, 0), (12, 30),  # 12:00-12:30 PM\n        (13, 0), (13, 30),  # 1:00-1:30 PM\n        (15, 0), (16, 0),  # 3:00-4:00 PM\n        (16, 30), (17, 0)  # 4:30-5:00 PM\n    ]\n    barbara_blocked = [\n        (10, 0), (10, 30),  # 10:00-10:30 AM\n        (13, 30), (14, 0)  # 1:30-2:00 PM\n    ]\n    jesse_blocked = [\n        (10, 0), (11, 0),  # 10:00-11:00 AM\n        (12, 30), (14, 30)  # 12:30-2:30 PM\n    ]\n    alan_blocked = [\n        (9, 30), (11, 0),  # 9:30-11:00 AM\n        (11, 30), (12, 30),  # 11:30-12:30 PM\n        (13, 0), (15, 30),  # 1:00-3:30 PM\n        (16, 0), (17, 0)    # 4:00-5:00 PM\n    ]\n    nicole_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (10, 30),  # 9:00-10:30 AM\n        (11, 30), (12, 0),  # 11:30-12:00 PM\n        (12, 30), (13, 30),  # 12:30-1:30 PM\n        (14, 0), (17, 0)    # 2:00-5:00 PM\n    ]\n    catherine_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (10, 30),  # 9:00-10:30 AM\n        (12, 0), (13, 30),  # 12:00-1:30 PM\n        (15, 0), (15, 30),  # 3:00-3:30 PM\n        (16, 0), (16, 30)   # 4:00-4:30 PM\n    ]\n\n    # Convert blocked times to minutes for easier comparison\n    gregory_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in gregory_blocked]\n    jonathan_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in jonathan_blocked]\n    barbara_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in barbara_blocked]\n    jesse_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in jesse_blocked]\n    alan_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in alan_blocked]\n    nicole_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in nicole_blocked]\n    catherine_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in catherine_blocked]\n\n    # Function to check if a time is blocked by a participant\n    def is_blocked(start, end, participant):\n        # Convert start and end to minutes\n        start_min = start * 60\n        end_min = end * 60\n        # Check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n        for block_start, block_end in participant:\n            if (start_min < block_end and end_min > block_start):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible start times within work hours\n    for start_h in range(9, 17):\n        for start_m in range(0, 60):\n            start_min = start_h * 60 + start_m\n            end_min = start_min + duration\n            if end_min > 17 * 60:\n                continue  # End after work hours\n\n            # Check if this time slot is free for everyone\n            if not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, gregory_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, jonathan_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, barbara_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, jesse_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, alan_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, nicole_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, catherine_blocked):\n                print(f\"{start_h:02}:{start_m:02}-{start_h:02}:{end_min//60:02}\")\n                print(\"Monday\")\n                return\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No available slot found\")\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
