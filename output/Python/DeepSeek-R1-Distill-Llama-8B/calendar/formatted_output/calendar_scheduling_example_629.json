            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to help schedule a meeting between Margaret and Alexis. The meeting should be 30 minutes long, and it can be on either Monday or Tuesday between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. \n\nFirst, I'll look at Margaret's schedule. She's blocked on Monday from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM, 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, and 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. She also has a meeting on Tuesday from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM. So, on Monday, the only free time before her first blocked slot is before 10:30 AM. After her last blocked slot on Monday at 3:00 PM, she's free until 5:00 PM. On Tuesday, she's busy from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, so she's free before that and after 12:30 PM.\n\nNext, I'll check Alexis's schedule. She has meetings on Monday from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. She also has a meeting on Tuesday from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM, and 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n\nConsidering Margaret's constraint of not wanting to meet on Monday, the only possible day is Tuesday. On Tuesday, Alexis is free from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM and from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM. Margaret is free from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM on Tuesday, so the overlapping time is 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM.\n\nWait, but Alexis has a meeting from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM on Tuesday. So, the latest they can start is after 9:30 AM. The next free slot for Alexis is from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM. Margaret is free from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM and after 12:30 PM. So, the overlapping time is from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM.\n\nBut wait, Alexis is free from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and Margaret is free from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM and after 12:30 PM. So, the latest they can start is 10:30 AM. If they start at 10:30 AM, they can meet until 11:00 AM. That's a 30-minute window.\n\nWait, but Margaret is free from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM and then from 12:30 PM onwards. So, the overlapping time where both are free is from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM. So, the latest they can start is 10:30 AM to have a 30-minute meeting ending by 11:00 AM.\n\nBut let me double-check. On Tuesday, Alexis is free from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, then she has a meeting from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM. So, after 10:30 AM, she's free until 12:00 PM. Margaret is free from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM and then from 12:30 PM onwards.\n\nSo, the overlapping time when both are free is from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM. Therefore, the latest they can start is 10:30 AM to have a 30-minute meeting ending at 11:00 AM.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM on Tuesday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define the work hours for the day (Monday or Tuesday)\n    work_hours = [(9, 0), (17, 0)]  # (start hour, start minute), (end hour, end minute)\n\n    # Define the working day in minutes\n    work_day = 17 * 60 - 9 * 60  # 480 minutes (8 hours)\n\n    # Define the blocked times for each participant\n    margaret_blocked = [\n        # Monday\n        ((10, 30), (11, 0)),\n        ((11, 30), (12, 0)),\n        ((13, 0), (13, 30)),\n        ((15, 0), (17, 0)),\n        # Tuesday\n        ((12, 0), (12, 30))\n    ]\n    alexis_blocked = [\n        # Monday\n        ((9, 30), (11, 30)),\n        ((12, 30), (13, 0)),\n        ((14, 0), (17, 0)),\n        # Tuesday\n        ((9, 0), (9, 30)),\n        ((10, 0), (10, 30)),\n        ((14, 0), (16, 30))\n    ]\n\n    # Convert blocked times to minutes for easier comparison\n    margaret_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in margaret_blocked]\n    alexis_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in alexis_blocked]\n\n    # Function to check if a time is blocked by a participant\n    def is_blocked(start, end, participant):\n        # Convert start and end to minutes\n        start_min = start * 60\n        end_min = end * 60\n        # Check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n        for block_start, block_end in participant:\n            if (start_min < block_end and end_min > block_start):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible start times within work hours\n    for day in [0, 1]:  # 0=Monday, 1=Tuesday\n        for start_h in range(9, 17):\n            for start_m in range(0, 60):\n                start_min = start_h * 60 + start_m\n                end_min = start_min + duration\n                if end_min > 17 * 60:\n                    continue  # End after work hours\n\n                # Check if this time slot is free for everyone\n                if not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, margaret_blocked) and \\\n                   not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, alexis_blocked):\n                    print(f\"{start_h:02}:{start_m:02}-{start_h:02}:{end_min//60:02}\")\n                    print(\"Monday\" if day == 0 else \"Tuesday\")\n                    return\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No available slot found\")\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
