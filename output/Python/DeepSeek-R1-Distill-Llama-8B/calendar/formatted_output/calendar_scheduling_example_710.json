            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting between Cheryl and Kyle. They both work from 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Cheryl is busy on Monday during specific times and also on Tuesday, but she can't meet on Wednesday. Kyle is busy on Monday all day, on Tuesday from 9:30 to 17:00, and on Wednesday in the morning and late afternoon.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the days Cheryl and Kyle are available. Cheryl is free on Monday except during her busy periods, and she's also free on Tuesday except for her meeting in the afternoon. She can't meet on Wednesday at all. Kyle is busy on Monday all day, so they can't meet then. On Tuesday, Kyle is busy from 9:30 to 17:00, so they need to find a time before 9:30 or after 17:00, but since they can only meet within 9:00 to 17:00, that leaves the earliest possible time on Tuesday before 9:30 or after 17:00, but after 17:00 is outside their work hours. So, they can't meet on Tuesday either. That leaves Wednesday as the only possible day.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kyle is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 and from 10:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 17:00. So the only free time they have on Wednesday is between 9:30 to 10:00. That's a 30-minute window. Cheryl isn't busy on Wednesday, so they can meet during that time.\n\nTherefore, the best time to schedule the meeting is on Wednesday from 9:30 to 10:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Cheryl's busy periods\n    cheryl_busy = [\n        (9 * 60, 10 * 60),    # 9:00-10:00\n        (11 * 60, 13 * 60),   # 11:30-13:00\n        (15 * 60, 16 * 60)    # 15:30-16:00\n    ]\n    cheryl_busy_tuesday = [\n        (15 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30)  # 15:00-15:30\n    ]\n\n    # Kyle's busy periods\n    kyle_busy = [\n        (9 * 60, 17 * 60),           # Monday\n        (9 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60),      # Tuesday\n        (9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30),       # Wednesday morning\n        (12 * 60, 13 * 60),         # Wednesday mid-morning\n        (13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60),     # Wednesday mid-afternoon\n        (14 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)      # Wednesday late afternoon\n    ]\n\n    # Function to check if time is free for a person\n    def is_free(busy_times, start, end):\n        for b in busy_times:\n            if (b[0] <= start < b[1]) or (b[0] <= end - 1 < b[1]):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Check each day starting from Monday\n    for day in ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']:\n        if day == 'Monday':\n            # Cheryl is busy on Monday, cannot meet\n            continue\n        elif day == 'Tuesday':\n            # Check if Cheryl is free on Tuesday\n            for slot in range(work_start, work_end + 1, 60):\n                slot_start = slot\n                slot_end = slot + meeting_duration\n                if slot_end > work_end:\n                    slot_end = work_end\n                if is_free(cheryl_busy_tuesday, slot_start, slot_end):\n                    if is_free(kyle_busy, slot_start, slot_end):\n                        return f\"{slot_start:02d}:{slot_end:02d}:{day}\"\n        elif day == 'Wednesday':\n            # Check if Cheryl is free on Wednesday\n            for slot in range(work_start, work_end + 1, 60):\n                slot_start = slot\n                slot_end = slot + meeting_duration\n                if slot_end > work_end:\n                    slot_end = work_end\n                if is_free(cheryl_busy, slot_start, slot_end):\n                    if is_free(kyle_busy, slot_start, slot_end):\n                        return f\"{slot_start:02d}:{slot_end:02d}:{day}\"\n\n    return None\n\n# Run the function and print the result\nresult = find_meeting_time()\nif result:\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(\"No suitable time found\")\n```",
