The meeting should last half an hour, and it has to be between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. But there are some constraints to consider.\n\nFirst, let's look at Tyler's schedule. He's busy on Tuesday from 9:00 to 9:30 and from 14:30 to 15:00. On Wednesday, he has meetings from 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, and 13:30 to 14:00, plus 16:30 to 17:00. So, Tyler is pretty busy on Tuesday and Wednesday, but on Monday, he's only busy during his work hours, which are standard.\n\nNow, Ruth has a more complex schedule. She's blocked her calendar on Monday from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. On Tuesday, she's completely booked from 9:00 to 17:00. On Wednesday, she's also booked the entire day from 9:00 to 17:00.\n\nTyler wants to avoid meetings on Monday before 16:00. So, we need to find a time that works for both of them, and also respects Tyler's preference.\n\nLet's start by checking each day one by one.\n\n**Monday:**\n- From 9:00 to 9:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 9:30 to 10:00: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 10:00 to 10:30: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 10:30 to 11:00: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 11:00 to 11:30: Both are free.\n- From 11:30 to 12:00: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 12:00 to 12:30: Both are free.\n- From 12:30 to 13:00: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 13:00 to 13:30: Both are free.\n- From 13:30 to 14:00: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 14:00 to 14:30: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 14:30 to 15:00: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 15:00 to 15:30: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 15:30 to 16:00: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 16:00 to 16:30: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n- From 16:30 to 17:00: Ruth is busy, so that's out.\n\nSo, on Monday, the only possible times are between 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, and 13:00 to 13:30. But Tyler wants to avoid meetings before 16:00 on Monday, which is already satisfied here.\n\n**Tuesday:**\n- From 9:00 to 9:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 9:30 to 10:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 10:00 to 10:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 10:30 to 11:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 11:00 to 11:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 11:30 to 12:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 12:00 to 12:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 12:30 to 13:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 13:00 to 13:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 13:30 to 14:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 14:30 to 15:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 15:00 to 15:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 15:30 to 16:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 16:30 to 17:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n\nSo, on Tuesday, there are no available times that work for Tyler.\n\n**Wednesday:**\n- From 9:00 to 9:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 9:30 to 10:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 10:00 to 10:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 10:30 to 11:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 11:00 to 11:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 11:30 to 12:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 12:00 to 12:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 12:30 to 13:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 13:00 to 13:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 13:30 to 14:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 14:00 to 14:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 14:30 to 15:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 15:00 to 15:30: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 15:30 to 16:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n- From 16:30 to 17:00: Tyler is busy, so that's out.\n\nSo, on Wednesday, there are no available times that work for Tyler.\n\nWait, that can't be right. There must be some overlap I'm missing. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back at Ruth's schedule on Monday, she's busy from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, the only free time on Monday is between 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, and 13:00 to 13:30.\n\nBut Tyler is also free during those times. However, Tyler wants to avoid meetings before 16:00 on Monday, which is already satisfied in those time slots.\n\nSo, the earliest available time is 11:00 to 11:30 on Monday.\n\nBut let me confirm with the code.\n\nThe code should iterate through each day, starting from Monday, then Tuesday, then Wednesday. For each day, it should check each hour from 9:00 to 17:00 in 30-minute increments.\n\nFor Monday, it should find the available time slots and return the earliest one.\n\nSo, the code should return 11:00-11:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\nThe suitable time for the meeting is 11:00 to 11:30 on Monday.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(schedules, duration=\"30:00\"):\n    all_free = []\n    for person in schedules:\n        free_times = []\n        for time in person:\n            if time[1] == True:\n                free_times.append((time[0], time[1]))\n        all_free.append(free_times)\n    \n    day_start = datetime.time(9, 0)\n    day_end = datetime.time(17, 0)\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n    \n    for day in days:\n        current_day = day_start\n        while current_day <= day_end:\n            end_time = datetime.time((current_day.hour + duration[0]) % 24, (current_day.minute + duration[1]) % 60)\n            if end_time > day_end:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            conflict = False\n            for person in all_free:\n                for time in person:\n                    if time[0] <= current_day < time[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            for person in all_free:\n                for time in person:\n                    if time[0] <= end_time < time[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            return f\"{current_day.hour:02}:{current_day.minute:02}:{end_time.hour:02}:{end_time.minute:02} {day}\"\n            \n            current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n    \n    return \"No suitable time found\"\n\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time([\n    [\n        (datetime.time(10, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(10, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(16, 30), False)\n    ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(9, 0), True) for _ in range(24*60)\n    ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(10, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(12, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(13, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(14, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(15, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(17, 0), True)\n    ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(10, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(12, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(13, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(14, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(15, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(17, 0), True)\n    ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(9, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(9, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(10, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(10, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(12, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(12, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(13, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(13, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(14, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(14, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(15, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(15, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(16, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(17, 0), False)\n    ]\n])\n```",
