            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I have to help schedule a meeting for six people: Doris, Theresa, Christian, Terry, Carolyn, and Kyle. The meeting needs to be half an hour long between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on Monday. Each person has their own blocked times during the day. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out when all of them are available. Let me list out each person's blocked times:\n\n- **Doris** is busy from 9:00 to 11:00 AM, then again from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, and from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n- **Theresa** is busy from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM.\n- **Christian** has no meetings the whole day, so he's completely free.\n- **Terry** is busy at 9:30 AM, then from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM, 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM, and from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n- **Carolyn** is busy from 9:00 to 10:30 AM, 11:00 to 11:30 AM, 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, and from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n- **Kyle** is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 AM, then from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM, and from 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nSince Christian is completely free, I don't need to worry about his schedule. I need to find a time where all the other five are available for at least half an hour.\n\nI think the best approach is to look for a time slot that doesn't overlap with anyone's busy periods. I'll start by listing all the blocked times and then see the gaps between them.\n\nLet me convert all blocked times to minutes past 9:00 for easier comparison:\n\n- **Doris**:\n  - 9:00 - 11:00 \u2192 0 - 60 minutes\n  - 13:30 - 14:00 \u2192 90 - 120 minutes\n  - 16:00 - 16:30 \u2192 210 - 225 minutes\n\n- **Theresa**:\n  - 10:00 - 12:00 \u2192 60 - 120 minutes\n\n- **Terry**:\n  - 9:30 - 10:00 \u2192 30 - 60 minutes\n  - 11:30 - 12:00 \u2192 90 - 120 minutes\n  - 12:30 - 13:00 \u2192 150 - 180 minutes\n  - 13:30 - 14:00 \u2192 180 - 240 minutes\n  - 14:30 - 15:00 \u2192 240 - 300 minutes\n  - 15:30 - 17:00 \u2192 300 - 420 minutes\n\n- **Carolyn**:\n  - 9:00 - 10:30 \u2192 0 - 90 minutes\n  - 11:00 - 11:30 \u2192 120 - 150 minutes\n  - 12:00 - 13:00 \u2192 180 - 240 minutes\n  - 13:30 - 14:30 \u2192 240 - 330 minutes\n  - 15:00 - 17:00 \u2192 300 - 420 minutes\n\n- **Kyle**:\n  - 9:00 - 9:30 \u2192 0 - 30 minutes\n  - 11:30 - 12:00 \u2192 90 - 120 minutes\n  - 12:30 - 13:00 \u2192 150 - 180 minutes\n  - 14:30 - 17:00 \u2192 240 - 420 minutes\n\nNow, let's list all the blocked intervals in order:\n\n1. **Kyle**: 0-30\n2. **Doris**: 0-60\n3. **Theresa**: 60-120\n4. **Terry**: 30-60\n5. **Carolyn**: 0-90\n6. **Doris**: 90-120\n7. **Theresa**: 60-120\n8. **Terry**: 90-120\n9. **Carolyn**: 120-150\n10. **Doris**: 210-225\n11. **Terry**: 180-240\n12. **Carolyn**: 180-240\n13. **Carolyn**: 240-330\n14. **Terry**: 180-240\n15. **Carolyn**: 240-330\n16. **Kyle**: 90-120\n17. **Terry**: 150-180\n18. **Kyle**: 150-180\n19. **Carolyn**: 300-420\n20. **Terry**: 300-420\n21. **Kyle**: 300-420\n\nThis is getting a bit messy. Maybe I should merge overlapping intervals first.\n\nLet's start by merging the intervals:\n\n- **0-30**: Kyle\n- **0-60**: Doris\n- **30-60**: Terry\n- **60-120**: Theresa\n- **90-120**: Doris and Terry\n- **120-150**: Carolyn\n- **150-180**: Terry and Kyle\n- **180-240**: Terry and Carolyn\n- **210-225**: Doris\n- **240-330**: Carolyn\n- **300-420**: Carolyn, Terry, and Kyle\n\nMerging:\n\n1. **0-60**: Kyle, Doris, Terry\n2. **60-120**: Theresa, Doris, Terry\n3. **120-150**: Carolyn\n4. **150-180**: Terry, Kyle\n5. **180-240**: Terry, Carolyn\n6. **210-225**: Doris\n7. **240-330**: Carolyn\n8. **300-420**: Carolyn, Terry, Kyle\n\nSo the merged blocked intervals are:\n\n- **0-60**\n- **60-120**\n- **120-150**\n- **150-180**\n- **180-240**\n- **210-225**\n- **240-330**\n- **300-420**\n\nNow, let's look for gaps between these intervals where a half-hour meeting can fit.\n\nBetween **0-60** and **60-120**: The first gap is from 60-60, which is zero. Not useful.\n\nBetween **60-120** and **120-150**: Gap from 120-120, zero again.\n\nBetween **120-150** and **150-180**: Gap from 150-150, zero.\n\nBetween **150-180** and **180-240**: Gap from 180-180, zero.\n\nBetween **180-240** and **210-225**: Gap from 210-210, zero.\n\nBetween **210-225** and **240-330**: Gap from 225-240, which is 15 minutes. Not enough.\n\nBetween **240-330** and **300-420**: Gap from 330-300, which is negative, so no gap.\n\nSo, after merging, there doesn't seem to be any gap where a half-hour meeting can fit. But that can't be right because the problem states there is a solution. Maybe I made a mistake in merging.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the intervals differently. Let me list the merged intervals again:\n\n1. **0-60**\n2. **60-120**\n3. **120-150**\n4. **150-180**\n5. **180-240**\n6. **210-225**\n7. **240-330**\n8. **300-420**\n\nLooking at these, between 0-60 and 60-120, the only gap is at 60-60, which is zero. Between 120-150 and 150-180, it's 150-150, zero. Between 210-225 and 240-330, there's a gap from 225-240, which is 15 minutes. That's not enough for a half-hour meeting.\n\nHmm, maybe I missed a gap somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meeting can start just before a blocked time ends. For example, if someone is free until 10:30, maybe the meeting can start at 10:30 and end at 11:00. But since we need half an hour, we need a 30-minute window.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the earliest possible time after the last blocked interval. The last blocked interval ends at 420 minutes (7:00 PM), which is the end of work hours. So the latest the meeting can start is at 15:30 (3:30 PM) to end at 16:00 (4:00 PM).\n\nBut looking at the blocked times, from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM, is that available?\n\nChecking the merged intervals:\n\n- **240-330**: This is 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM. So 3:30 PM is the start of this interval.\n\nSo the meeting would have to start before 3:30 PM.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the gaps more carefully. Let me list all the merged intervals with their start and end times:\n\n1. **0-60**: 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM\n2. **60-120**: 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM\n3. **120-150**: 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM\n4. **150-180**: 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM\n5. **180-240**: 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM\n6. **210-225**: 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM\n7. **240-330**: 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM\n8. **300-420**: 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM\n\nWait, interval 5 is 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and interval 6 is 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So interval 6 is entirely within interval 5. That means interval 5 should be merged with interval 6.\n\nSimilarly, interval 7 (4:00 PM to 5:30 PM) and interval 8 (5:00 PM to 7:00 PM) should be merged into 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nSo the correct merged intervals are:\n\n1. **0-60**: 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM\n2. **60-120**: 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM\n3. **120-150**: 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM\n4. **150-180**: 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM\n5. **180-240**: 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM\n6. **240-420**: 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM\n\nNow, let's look for gaps:\n\n- Before 0-60: No.\n- Between 0-60 and 60-120: 10:00 AM to 10:00 AM, no gap.\n- Between 60-120 and 120-150: 12:00 PM to 12:00 PM, no gap.\n- Between 120-150 and 150-180: 1:00 PM to 1:00 PM, no gap.\n- Between 150-180 and 180-240: 2:00 PM to 2:00 PM, no gap.\n- Between 180-240 and 240-420: 4:00 PM to 4:00 PM, no gap.\n\nSo, there are no gaps where a half-hour meeting can fit. But the problem states that a solution exists. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the meeting can start just before a blocked time ends. For example, if someone is free until 10:00 AM, maybe the meeting can start at 10:00 AM and end at 10:30 AM. But I need to check all participants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the meeting can start at 10:30 AM, but I need to ensure that all participants are free from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM.\n\nLet me check each person's availability between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM:\n\n- **Doris**: Blocked until 11:00 AM, so free at 11:00 AM. So she's busy until 11:00 AM, meaning she's free from 11:00 AM onwards. So she can meet after 11:00 AM.\n- **Theresa**: Blocked until 12:00 PM, so she's free from 12:00 PM onwards.\n- **Christian**: Free all day.\n- **Terry**: Blocked until 11:30 AM, then free from 11:30 AM onwards.\n- **Carolyn**: Blocked until 11:30 AM, then free from 11:30 AM onwards.\n- **Kyle**: Blocked until 11:30 AM, then free from 11:30 AM onwards.\n\nSo, from 11:30 AM onwards, all participants are free. The latest the meeting can start is at 15:30 (3:30 PM) to end at 16:00 (4:00 PM), as that's the latest half-hour slot before work ends at 17:00.\n\nWait, but the merged intervals show that from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM is blocked. So the latest the meeting can start is at 15:30 (3:30 PM) to end at 16:00 (4:00 PM).\n\nBut let me check if all participants are free from 15:30 to 16:00.\n\n- **Doris**: Free from 11:00 AM onwards, so yes.\n- **Theresa**: Free from 12:00 PM onwards, so yes.\n- **Christian**: Free all day, yes.\n- **Terry**: Free from 11:30 AM onwards, yes.\n- **Carolyn**: Free from 11:30 AM onwards, yes.\n- **Kyle**: Free from 11:30 AM onwards, yes.\n\nSo, 15:30 to 16:00 seems available. But wait, let me check the merged intervals again. The last merged interval is 240-420, which is 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. So 3:30 PM is before 4:00 PM, which is the start of the blocked time.\n\nSo, the meeting can start at 3:30 PM and end at 4:00 PM. But I need to ensure that all participants are free during that time.\n\nFrom the individual schedules:\n\n- **Doris**: Free after 11:00 AM, so yes.\n- **Theresa**: Free after 12:00 PM, so yes.\n- **Christian**: Free all day, yes.\n- **Terry**: Free after 11:30 AM, so yes.\n- **Carolyn**: Free after 11:30 AM, so yes.\n- **Kyle**: Free after 11:30 AM, so yes.\n\nTherefore, 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM is a viable time slot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an earlier slot. Let's see.\n\nLooking back, after 11:30 AM, all participants are free. So any time between 11:30 AM and 3:30 PM could potentially work, but I need to check for the earliest available slot.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find a time that works for everyone, not necessarily the earliest. Since the latest possible is 3:30 PM, but maybe an earlier time is better.\n\nLet me check for the earliest possible time after 11:30 AM.\n\nLooking at the merged intervals, after 11:30 AM, the next blocked time is at 12:00 PM for Theresa and Doris. So from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, is that available?\n\nWait, **Doris** is free from 11:00 AM onwards, so she's free at 11:30 AM. **Theresa** is free from 12:00 PM onwards, so she's busy until 12:00 PM. **Terry** is free from 11:30 AM onwards, **Carolyn** is free from 11:30 AM onwards, and **Kyle** is free from 11:30 AM onwards.\n\nSo, from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, all except Theresa are free. Theresa is busy until 12:00 PM, so the meeting can't include her being busy. Therefore, the meeting can't start before 12:00 PM.\n\nWait, but Theresa is free from 12:00 PM onwards. So if the meeting starts at 12:00 PM, it would end at 12:30 PM, which is after her 12:00 PM block. Wait, no, her block is from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. So she's busy until 12:00 PM, meaning she's free from 12:00 PM onwards.\n\nTherefore, the meeting can start at 12:00 PM, but it needs to end by 12:30 PM. Let me check if all participants are free from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM.\n\n- **Doris**: Free from 11:00 AM onwards, so yes.\n- **Theresa**: Free from 12:00 PM onwards, so yes.\n- **Christian**: Free all day, yes.\n- **Terry**: Free from 11:30 AM onwards, yes.\n- **Carolyn**: Free from 11:30 AM onwards, yes.\n- **Kyle**: Free from 11:30 AM onwards, yes.\n\nSo, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM is also a viable slot.\n\nSimilarly, the meeting can be scheduled any time from 12:00 PM to 3:30 PM, as all participants are free after 11:30 AM, except for their specific blocked times.\n\nBut the problem is to find a suitable time, not necessarily the earliest. However, it's good practice to find the earliest possible time that works. So, 12:00 PM seems better than 3:30 PM.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's an earlier slot before 12:00 PM.\n\nLooking back at the merged intervals, before 12:00 PM, the last blocked interval is 11:30 AM. So from 11:30 AM onwards, all participants are free except for specific times.\n\nWait, but **Doris** is free from 11:00 AM onwards, **Theresa** is free from 12:00 PM onwards, **Terry** is free from 11:30 AM onwards, **Carolyn** is free from 11:30 AM onwards, and **Kyle** is free from 11:30 AM onwards.\n\nSo, from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, **Theresa** is busy until 12:00 PM. Therefore, the meeting can't start before 12:00 PM if we need all participants to be available.\n\nTherefore, the earliest possible time is 12:00 PM.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm:\n\n- **Doris**: Free from 11:00 AM onwards, so she's available at 12:00 PM.\n- **Theresa**: Free from 12:00 PM onwards, so she's available starting at 12:00 PM.\n- **Christian**: Free all day, yes.\n- **Terry**: Free from 11:30 AM onwards, yes.\n- **Carolyn**: Free from 11:30 AM onwards, yes.\n- **Kyle**: Free from 11:30 AM onwards, yes.\n\nSo, 12:00 PM is a viable start time.\n\nAlternatively, if we start at 12:30 PM, that's also possible, but 12:00 PM is earlier.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM.\n\nBut wait, let's check the merged intervals again. The merged intervals after 11:30 AM are:\n\n- **180-240**: 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM\n- **240-420**: 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM\n\nBut we're considering times after 11:30 AM, which is outside the merged intervals. So, the meeting can be scheduled any time after 11:30 AM, as long as it doesn't conflict with any individual's blocked times.\n\nTherefore, the earliest possible time is 12:00 PM.\n\nI think 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM is a good time slot that works for everyone.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal time for the meeting is from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM on Monday.\n\n```python\n# Define the work hours\nstart_work = (9, 0)\nend_work = (17, 0)\n\n# Define the blocked times for each participant\ndoris_blocked = [(9, 0), (10, 0), (13, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30)]\ntheresa_blocked = [(10, 0), (12, 0)]\nchristian_blocked = []\nterry_blocked = [(9, 30), (11, 30), (12, 30), (13, 30), (14, 30), (15, 30), (16, 30)]\ncarolyn_blocked = [(9, 0), (10, 30), (11, 0), (12, 0), (13, 30), (15, 0), (16, 0), (17, 0)]\nkyle_blocked = [(9, 0), (11, 30), (12, 30), (14, 30)]\n\n# Convert blocked times to minutes since 00:00\ndef to_minutes(time):\n    return time[0] * 60 + time[1]\n\ndoris_blocked_mins = [to_minutes(t) for t in doris_blocked]\ntheresa_blocked_mins = [to_minutes(t) for t in theresa_blocked]\nchristian_blocked_mins = [to_minutes(t) for t in christian_blocked]\nterry_blocked_mins = [to_minutes(t) for t in terry_blocked]\ncarolyn_blocked_mins = [to_minutes(t) for t in carolyn_blocked]\nkyle_blocked_mins = [to_minutes(t) for t in kyle_blocked]\n\n# Combine all blocked times\nall_blocked = [\n    (0, 60),\n    (60, 120),\n    (90, 120),\n    (120, 150),\n    (150, 180),\n    (180, 240),\n    (210, 225),\n    (240, 420)\n]\n\n# Sort the blocked intervals\nall_blocked.sort()\n\n# Find the earliest available time slot that fits the meeting duration\nmeeting_duration = 30\ncurrent_time = start_work\nday_of_week = \"Monday\"\n\nwhile True:\n    # Convert current_time to minutes\n    current_mins = current_time[0] * 60 + current_time[1]\n    \n    # Check if there's space for the meeting before the next blocked time\n    next_available = current_mins + meeting_duration\n    next_blocked = None\n    \n    for block in all_blocked:\n        if block[0] >= current_mins:\n            if next_available < block[0]:\n                next_available = block[0] - meeting_duration\n                next_blocked = block[0]\n                break\n        else:\n            if next_available < block[1]:\n                next_available = block[1] - meeting_duration\n                next_blocked = block[1]\n                break\n    \n    # If found a suitable slot, break the loop\n    if next_blocked is not None:\n        break\n    \n    # Move to the next hour if no slot is found\n    if current_time[1] == 59:\n        current_time = (current_time[0] + 1, 0)\n    else:\n        current_time = (current_time[0], current_time[1] + 1)\n\n# Convert next_available back to hours and minutes\nstart_hh, start_mm = divmod(next_available, 60)\nend_hh, end_mm = divmod(next_available + meeting_duration, 60)\n\n# Format the output\nprint(f\"{start_hh:02}:{start_mm:02}:{end_hh:02}:{end_mm:02}\")\nprint(f\"{day_of_week}\")\n```",
