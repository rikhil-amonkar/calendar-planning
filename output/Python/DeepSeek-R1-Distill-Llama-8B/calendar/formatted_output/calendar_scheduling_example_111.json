            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to help schedule a meeting for Gregory, Natalie, Christine, and Vincent. The meeting should last 30 minutes between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on Monday. Let's go through each person's schedule and see where they have free time.\n\nFirst, Gregory has blocked times on Monday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:30-13:00, and 13:30-14:00. So, his busy periods are in the morning and early afternoon.\n\nNatalie has no meetings all day, so she's completely free.\n\nChristine has meetings from 9:00-11:30 and 13:30-17:00. That means she's busy in the morning and afternoon, with a break between 11:30 AM and 13:30 PM.\n\nVincent has blocked times on Monday: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-14:00, and 14:30-17:00. So, he's busy in the early morning, mid-morning, midday, and late afternoon.\n\nLooking for a 30-minute window where everyone is free. Let's check each time slot.\n\nFrom 9:00 to 9:30, Gregory is busy, so that's out.\n\nFrom 9:30 to 10:00, Gregory is busy until 10:00. So, 9:30-10:00 is partially free but Gregory is busy until 10:00, so not good.\n\nFrom 10:00 to 10:30, Gregory is busy until 10:30. So, 10:00-10:30 is partially free but Gregory is busy until 10:30, so not good.\n\nFrom 10:30 to 11:00, Gregory is busy until 11:30, so no good.\n\nFrom 11:00 to 11:30, Gregory is busy until 11:30, so no good.\n\nFrom 11:30 to 12:00, Gregory is busy until 12:30, so no good.\n\nFrom 12:00 to 12:30, Gregory is busy until 12:30, so no good.\n\nFrom 12:30 to 13:00, Gregory is busy until 13:00, so no good.\n\nFrom 13:00 to 13:30, Gregory is busy until 13:30, so no good.\n\nFrom 13:30 to 14:00, Gregory is busy until 14:00, so no good.\n\nFrom 14:00 to 14:30, Gregory is busy until 14:30, so no good.\n\nFrom 14:30 to 15:00, Gregory is busy until 17:00, so no good.\n\nFrom 15:00 to 15:30, Gregory is busy until 17:00, so no good.\n\nFrom 15:30 to 16:00, Gregory is busy until 17:00, so no good.\n\nFrom 16:00 to 16:30, Gregory is busy until 17:00, so no good.\n\nFrom 16:30 to 17:00, Gregory is busy until 17:00, so no good.\n\nWait, that can't be right. There must be some overlap where everyone is free. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking again, maybe I missed a window. Let's see:\n\n- Between 11:30 AM and 12:00 PM, Gregory is busy until 12:30, so no.\n\n- Between 12:30 PM and 1:00 PM, Gregory is busy until 1:00 PM, so no.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that after 12:00 PM, some people become free.\n\nLet me check each person's free times:\n\n- Gregory: Free from 14:00-14:30 and 17:00-17:30.\n\n- Natalie: Entire day is free.\n\n- Christine: Busy until 11:30 AM and from 13:30 PM to 17:00 PM.\n\n- Vincent: Free from 14:00-14:30 and 17:00-17:30.\n\nSo, the only overlapping free time is between 14:00-14:30 PM.\n\nThat's the only window where everyone is free.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(schedules, duration=\"30:00\"):\n    all_free = []\n    for person in schedules:\n        free_times = []\n        for time in person:\n            if time[1] == True:\n                free_times.append((time[0], time[1]))\n        all_free.append(free_times)\n    \n    day_start = datetime.time(9, 0)\n    day_end = datetime.time(17, 0)\n    days = [\"Monday\"]\n    \n    for day in days:\n        current_day = day_start\n        while current_day <= day_end:\n            end_time = datetime.time((current_day.hour + duration[0]) % 24, (current_day.minute + duration[1]) % 60)\n            if end_time > day_end:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            conflict = False\n            for person in all_free:\n                for time in person:\n                    if time[0] <= current_day < time[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            for person in all_free:\n                for time in person:\n                    if time[0] <= end_time < time[1]:\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n                continue\n            \n            return f\"{current_day.hour:02}:{current_day.minute:02}:{end_time.hour:02}:{end_time.minute:02} {day}\"\n            \n            current_day += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)\n    \n    return \"No suitable time found\"\n\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time([\n    [\n        (datetime.time(9, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(9, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(10, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(10, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(12, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(12, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(13, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(13, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(14, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(14, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(15, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(15, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(16, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(17, 0), False)\n    ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(9, 0), True) for _ in range(24*60)\n    ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(9, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(10, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(12, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(13, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(14, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(15, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(17, 0), True)\n    ],\n    [\n        (datetime.time(9, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(9, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(10, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(10, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(11, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(11, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(12, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(12, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(13, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(13, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(14, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(14, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(15, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(15, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(16, 0), True),\n        (datetime.time(16, 30), False),\n        (datetime.time(17, 0), False)\n    ]\n])\n```",
