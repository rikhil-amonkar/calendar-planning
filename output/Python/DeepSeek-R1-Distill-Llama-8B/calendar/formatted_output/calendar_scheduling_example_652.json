            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting between Jesse and Lawrence for half an hour between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on either Monday or Tuesday. Let me start by looking at their schedules.\n\nFirst, Jesse's schedule on Monday is blocked from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM. On Tuesday, Jesse is busy from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM and again from 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM and 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. So, Jesse has some busy times on both days.\n\nLawrence is more restricted. On Monday, he's busy the entire day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. On Tuesday, his blocked times are from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM, and 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. Lawrence can't meet on Tuesday after 4:30 PM.\n\nSince Lawrence can't meet on Tuesday after 4:30 PM, I should look for times on Tuesday before 4:30 PM that work for both. Also, considering that Jesse is busy on Tuesday from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM and from 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM and 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, I need to find a time that doesn't overlap with these periods.\n\nLet me check the work hours from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. On Tuesday, possible slots before 4:30 PM could be between 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM, but Jesse is busy from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM. Wait, no, Jesse is busy from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM on Tuesday. So that slot is taken.\n\nNext, between 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM, Lawrence is busy, so that's not available. After 1:00 PM, Jesse is busy until 1:30 PM and again from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. So, the only slot left on Tuesday before 4:30 PM is between 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM.\n\nWait, but Lawrence is busy from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM on Tuesday. So the latest available time on Tuesday before 4:30 PM is 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. Let me check if Jesse is available during that time.\n\nJesse's Tuesday schedule shows he's busy from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, so 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM might be free. Lawrence is busy from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM, so the meeting would end at 3:30 PM, which is before his block starts. That should work.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Monday, Lawrence is fully booked, so the only available time is on Tuesday before 4:30 PM. Therefore, the earliest available time is 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM on Tuesday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define the work hours for the day (Monday or Tuesday)\n    work_hours = [(9, 0), (17, 0)]  # (start hour, start minute), (end hour, end minute)\n\n    # Define the working day in minutes\n    work_day = 17 * 60 - 9 * 60  # 480 minutes (8 hours)\n\n    # Define the blocked times for each participant\n    jesse_blocked = [\n        # Monday\n        ((13, 0), (14, 0)),  # 1:00-2:00 PM\n        ((14, 30), (15, 0)),  # 2:30-3:00 PM\n        # Tuesday\n        ((9, 0), (9, 30)),  # 9:00-9:30 AM\n        ((13, 0), (13, 30)),  # 1:00-1:30 PM\n        ((14, 0), (15, 0))    # 2:00-3:00 PM\n    ]\n    lawrence_blocked = [\n        # Monday\n        ((9, 0), (17, 0)),  # 9:00-5:00 PM\n        # Tuesday\n        ((9, 30), (10, 30)),  # 9:30-10:30 AM\n        ((11, 30), (12, 30)),  # 11:30-12:30 PM\n        ((13, 0), (13, 30)),  # 1:00-1:30 PM\n        ((14, 30), (15, 0)),  # 2:30-3:00 PM\n        ((15, 30), (16, 30))  # 3:30-4:30 PM\n    ]\n\n    # Convert blocked times to minutes for easier comparison\n    jesse_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in jesse_blocked]\n    lawrence_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in lawrence_blocked]\n\n    # Function to check if a time is blocked by a participant\n    def is_blocked(start, end, participant):\n        # Convert start and end to minutes\n        start_min = start * 60\n        end_min = end * 60\n        # Check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n        for block_start, block_end in participant:\n            if (start_min < block_end and end_min > block_start):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible start times within work hours\n    for day in [0, 1]:  # 0=Monday, 1=Tuesday\n        for start_h in range(9, 17):\n            for start_m in range(0, 60):\n                start_min = start_h * 60 + start_m\n                end_min = start_min + duration\n                if end_min > 17 * 60:\n                    continue  # End after work hours\n\n                # Check if this time slot is free for everyone\n                if not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, jesse_blocked) and \\\n                   not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, lawrence_blocked):\n                    print(f\"{start_h:02}:{start_m:02}-{start_h:02}:{end_min//60:02}\")\n                    print(\"Monday\" if day == 0 else \"Tuesday\")\n                    return\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No available slot found\")\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
