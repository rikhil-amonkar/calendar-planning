            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to figure out how to schedule a meeting for Adam, John, Stephanie, and Anna on Monday. The meeting should last half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each person's schedule to see when they're free. \n\nAdam is busy from 14:00 to 15:00. So, the latest he can start is after 15:00. But since the meeting is half an hour, his latest possible start time would be 16:00.\n\nJohn is busy from 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. This means John has gaps between these busy periods. Specifically, he's free from 11:00 to 13:00, and again from 14:30 to 15:30.\n\nStephanie is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. Her free time is from 13:00 to 14:00 and 15:00 to 16:00.\n\nAnna is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:30, and 16:30 to 17:00. She prefers not meeting before 14:30. So, her earliest available time after 14:30 is 14:30.\n\nNow, considering everyone's constraints:\n\n- Adam is free after 15:00.\n- John is free between 14:30 to 15:30.\n- Stephanie is free between 13:00 to 14:00 and 15:00 to 16:00.\n- Anna is free after 14:30.\n\nLooking for a time that works for all, the latest possible time after Anna's constraint is 14:30. Checking John's availability, he's free from 14:30 to 15:30. Stephanie is also free from 15:00 to 16:00. Adam is free after 15:00.\n\nSo, the latest time that fits all is 15:00. This gives a meeting time from 15:00 to 16:00.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(schedules, duration, day_of_week):\n    # Convert day of week to Monday\n    if day_of_week == 'Tuesday':\n        day = datetime.date.weekday(datetime.date.today()) + 1\n    else:\n        day = datetime.date.weekday(datetime.date.today())\n    \n    # Check if today is the correct day\n    if datetime.date.today().weekday() != day:\n        return \"No meeting possible on the specified day.\"\n    \n    # Define the work hours\n    start_time = datetime.time(9, 0)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17, 0)\n    \n    # Function to check if a time is within a busy period\n    def is_busy(person, time):\n        for period in person:\n            if period[0] <= time < period[1]:\n                return True\n        return False\n    \n    # Convert schedules to time ranges\n    all_busy = [person for person in schedules]\n    \n    # Check each day from earliest to latest\n    for day in day_of_week:\n        day = datetime.date.fromisoformat(day)\n        if day < datetime.date.today():\n            continue\n        \n        # Check each possible time slot\n        for hour in range(17, 9, -1):\n            for minute in range(0, 60):\n                start = datetime.time(hour, minute)\n                end = start + datetime.timedelta(hours=duration)\n                \n                # Check if the time is within work hours\n                if end > end_time:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Check if all are free\n                conflict = False\n                for person in all_busy:\n                    if is_busy(person, start):\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Return the earliest possible time\n                return f\"{hour:02}:{minute:02}:{end.hour:02}:{end.minute:02} {day.weekday():strftime('%A', day)}\"\n    \n    return \"No meeting possible within the given constraints.\"\n\n# Example usage:\n# schedules = {\n#     \"Adam\": [(datetime.time(14, 0), datetime.time(15, 0))],\n#     \"John\": [\n#         (datetime.time(13, 0), datetime.time(13, 30)),\n#         (datetime.time(14, 0), datetime.time(14, 30)),\n#         (datetime.time(15, 30), datetime.time(16, 0)),\n#         (datetime.time(16, 30), datetime.time(17, 0))\n#     ],\n#     \"Stephanie\": [\n#         (datetime.time(9, 30), datetime.time(10, 0)),\n#         (datetime.time(10, 30), datetime.time(11, 0)),\n#         (datetime.time(11, 30), datetime.time(16, 0)),\n#         (datetime.time(16, 30), datetime.time(17, 0))\n#     ],\n#     \"Anna\": [\n#         (datetime.time(9, 30), datetime.time(10, 0)),\n#         (datetime.time(12, 0), datetime.time(12, 30)),\n#         (datetime.time(13, 0), datetime.time(15, 30)),\n#         (datetime.time(16, 30), datetime.time(17, 0))\n#     ]\n# }\n# print(find_meeting_time(schedules, datetime.timedelta(hours=0.5), [\"Monday\"]))\n```",
