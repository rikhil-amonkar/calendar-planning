            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Diane, Jack, Eugene, and Patricia on Monday. The meeting should last half an hour between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. Let me see what each person's schedule looks like.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Diane. She's busy from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM and again from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM. So those times are definitely off the table.\n\nNext, Jack is blocked from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM and again from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM. So I need to avoid those slots too.\n\nEugene has a lot of blocks. He's busy from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM, 12:00 PM to 2:30 PM, and 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM. That's a lot of time already taken up.\n\nLastly, Patricia is busy from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM, and 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM. So her schedule is pretty packed as well.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that's free for all four of them. Since everyone is busy in the morning, maybe the best time is in the afternoon. Let's see.\n\nLooking at Diane's blocks, she's free from 10:00 AM to 9:30 AM? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to check each person's schedule more carefully.\n\nWait, no, Diane's blocks are from 9:30 to 10:00 and 2:30 to 3:00. So between 10:00 AM and 2:30 PM, she's free. But Jack is blocked from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM. So there's a window from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM where both Diane and Jack are free, but Eugene is blocked from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me list out all the blocked times again.\n\nDiane:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 2:30-3:00\n\nJack:\n- 1:30-2:00\n- 2:30-3:00\n\nEugene:\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 10:30-11:30\n- 12:00-2:30\n- 3:00-4:30\n\nPatricia:\n- 9:30-10:30\n- 11:00-12:00\n- 12:30-2:00\n- 3:00-4:30\n\nSo, looking for a half-hour window where none of them are busy. Let's check from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM. Diane is free there, but Patricia is blocked from 9:30 to 10:30. So that's no good.\n\nWhat about after 2:00 PM? Diane is free from 2:30 PM onwards, but Jack is blocked from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM and again from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM. So between 3:00 PM and 4:30 PM, both Diane and Jack are free, but Eugene and Patricia are blocked until 4:30 PM.\n\nWait, is there any time where all four are free? Maybe in the late afternoon after 4:30 PM, but the meeting has to be within 9:00 to 5:00 PM. So the latest we can start is 4:30 PM, but that's when Eugene and Patricia are free, but Jack is blocked until 3:00 PM. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each person's schedule again.\n\nDiane is free from 10:00 AM to 9:30 AM? That doesn't make sense. Maybe she's free from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM, excluding her blocked times.\n\nJack is free from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM and from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n\nEugene is free from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM and from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nPatricia is free from 2:00 PM to 9:30 PM, but she's blocked until 4:30 PM.\n\nWait, no, Patricia is blocked until 4:30 PM, so she's free from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- Diane is free from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM and from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n- Jack is free from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM and from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n- Eugene is free from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM and from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n- Patricia is free from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM and from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nSo the overlapping free times are from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nBut the meeting needs to be half an hour, so starting at 4:30 PM would end at 5:00 PM, which is within the work hours.\n\nSo the only possible time is from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    work_hours = [(9, 17)]  # Monday\n    # Meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n    \n    # Available day\n    available_day = 'Monday'\n    \n    # Define blocked times for each person\n    blocked_times = {\n        'Diane': {\n            'Monday': [(9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60), (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60)]\n        },\n        'Jack': {\n            'Monday': [(13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60), (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60)]\n        },\n        'Eugene': {\n            'Monday': [(9 * 60, 10 * 60), (10 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60), (12 * 60, 14 * 60 + 30), (15 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)]\n        },\n        'Patricia': {\n            'Monday': [(9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60 + 30), (11 * 60, 12 * 60), (12 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60), (15 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)]\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Convert day to numerical value\n    day_num = {'Monday': 0}\n    \n    # Check each time slot in the working hours\n    for hour in range(9, 17):\n        for minute in range(0, 60):\n            start = hour * 60 + minute\n            end = start + duration\n            \n            # Check if the time slot is within working hours\n            if start < 9 * 60 or end > 17 * 60:\n                continue\n            \n            # Check against each person's blocked times\n            all_available = True\n            for person in ['Diane', 'Jack', 'Eugene', 'Patricia']:\n                if person in blocked_times and day_num == 0:  # Only check for Monday\n                    for block_start, block_end in blocked_times[person]['Monday']:\n                        if block_start <= start < block_end:\n                            all_available = False\n                            break\n                    if not all_available:\n                        break\n            \n            if all_available:\n                print(f\"{start // 60:02d}:{start % 60:02d}-{end // 60:02d}:{end % 60:02d} Monday\")\n                return f\"{start // 60:02d}:{start % 60:02d}-{end // 60:02d}:{end % 60:02d} Monday\"\n    \n    # If no slot is found, return an error message\n    return \"No available time found.\"\n```",
