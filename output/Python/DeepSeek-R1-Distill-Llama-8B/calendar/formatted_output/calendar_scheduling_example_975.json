Let me look at their schedules to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I'll check Nicole's schedule. She has meetings on Tuesday from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM, Wednesday from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM, and Friday from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM and 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So, Nicole is busy on those specific times on those days.\n\nNext, Daniel's schedule is more extensive. He's busy on Monday from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, and 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM. On Tuesday, he's busy from 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM. On Wednesday, he's busy from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM. On Thursday, he's busy from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, and 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. On Friday, he's busy from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM, 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM, and 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that's available for both Nicole and Daniel, preferably as early as possible. Let me go through each day one by one, starting from Monday.\n\nOn Monday, Daniel is busy from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM, so the earliest available time after that is 12:30 PM. Nicole isn't busy on Monday, so maybe 12:30 PM could work. But let's check if there's an earlier slot on another day.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nicole is busy from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM. Daniel is busy from 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM. So, the earliest available time after 4:30 PM would be 4:30 PM, but Nicole is busy until 4:30 PM, and Daniel is busy until 5:00 PM. So, maybe 5:00 PM, but that's the end of the workday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nicole is busy from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. Daniel is busy from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM. So, the earliest available time after 3:30 PM would be 3:30 PM, but Daniel is busy until 4:30 PM. So, maybe 4:30 PM, but Nicole isn't busy then, and Daniel is available.\n\nOn Thursday, Daniel is busy from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, and 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. So, the earliest available time after 3:30 PM would be 3:30 PM, but Nicole isn't busy then. So, 3:30 PM might work.\n\nOn Friday, Nicole is busy from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM and 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. Daniel is busy from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM, 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM, and 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM. So, the earliest available time after 12:30 PM would be 12:30 PM, but Daniel is busy until 4:30 PM. So, maybe 4:30 PM, but Nicole isn't busy then.\n\nComparing all the options, the earliest available time is on Wednesday at 3:30 PM or Thursday at 3:30 PM. Since the group wants to meet at their earliest availability, Wednesday at 3:30 PM seems better.\n\nWait, but on Wednesday, Nicole is busy from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM, so she's available at 3:30 PM. Daniel is busy until 4:30 PM, so he's available at 3:30 PM. So, 3:30 PM on Wednesday is a good time.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's an earlier time on another day.\n\nOn Monday, after 12:30 PM, is there a slot before that? Daniel is busy until 12:30 PM, so the next available time is 12:30 PM. Nicole isn't busy then, so maybe 12:30 PM on Monday.\n\nBut the group prefers the earliest availability, so 12:30 PM on Monday is earlier than 3:30 PM on Wednesday.\n\nWait, but I thought Nicole isn't busy on Monday. Let me confirm. Nicole's meetings on Monday are only on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. So, she's available on Monday after her meetings, which are on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. So, on Monday, she's free all day except for her meetings on other days.\n\nWait, no, Nicole's schedule is on specific days: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. So on Monday, she's free the entire day.\n\nSo, on Monday, after Daniel's meeting ends at 12:30 PM, at 12:30 PM, Nicole is free. So, 12:30 PM on Monday is a possible time.\n\nThat's earlier than Wednesday's 3:30 PM, so that's better.\n\nWait, but let me check if both are available at 12:30 PM on Monday.\n\nDaniel's schedule on Monday is busy from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM, so he's available at 12:30 PM.\n\nNicole isn't busy on Monday, so she's available.\n\nSo, 12:30 PM on Monday is a good time.\n\nBut let me see if there's an earlier time on Monday.\n\nDaniel is busy until 12:30 PM, so the earliest time after that is 12:30 PM.\n\nNicole isn't busy on Monday, so 12:30 PM is possible.\n\nSo, 12:30 PM on Monday is the earliest time.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a time before 12:30 PM on Monday.\n\nDaniel is busy until 12:30 PM, so before that, he's busy.\n\nNicole isn't busy on Monday, but Daniel is busy until 12:30 PM.\n\nSo, the earliest time is 12:30 PM on Monday.\n\nBut the group wants the earliest availability, so 12:30 PM on Monday is better than later times on other days.\n\nSo, the meeting should be at 12:30 PM on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nparticipants = [\n    {'name': 'Nicole', 'blocks': [(630, 660), (900, 930), (780, 810), (990, 1020)]},  # Tuesday 16:00-16:30, Wednesday 15:00-15:30, Friday 12:00-12:30, 15:30-16:00\n    {'name': 'Daniel', 'blocks': [(270, 300), (540, 570), (630, 660), (690, 720), (780, 840), (870, 900), (930, 960), (990, 1020)]}  # Monday: 9:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-16:30; Tuesday: 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00; Wednesday: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 16:30-17:00; Thursday: 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 15:00-15:30; Friday: 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n]\n\nday_options = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']\n\nfor day in day_options:\n    if day == 'Monday':\n        start_times = [900, 1050, 1170, 1260, 1380, 1500, 1710]\n    elif day == 'Tuesday':\n        start_times = [540, 630, 690, 780, 870, 960, 1050]\n    elif day == 'Wednesday':\n        start_times = [900, 1050, 1170, 1260, 1380, 1500, 1710]\n    elif day == 'Thursday':\n        start_times = [630, 690, 750, 840, 930, 1020, 1110]\n    elif day == 'Friday':\n        start_times = [600, 630, 690, 750, 870, 930, 1020]\n    \n    for start in start_times:\n        slot = (start, start + 60)\n        conflict = False\n        for participant in participants:\n            for block in participant['blocks']:\n                if not (block[1] < slot[0] or block[0] > slot[1]):\n                    conflict = True\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                break\n        if not conflict:\n            print(f\"{start//30:02d}:{start%30:02d}-{(start+60)//30:02d}:{(start+60)%30:02d} Monday\")\n            exit()\n```",
