            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to schedule a meeting between James and John for one hour during their work hours on Monday. Let me start by understanding the existing schedules and constraints.\n\nFirst, James has blocked times on Monday from 11:30 to 12:00 and again from 14:30 to 15:00. That means those time slots are already taken and can't be used. John, on the other hand, is busy from 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, and 14:30 to 16:30. So John's schedule is pretty packed, especially in the morning and late afternoon.\n\nThe meeting needs to last one hour, and it has to fit within the 9:00 to 17:00 work hours on Monday. Since both James and John are available for an hour, I should look for a time slot that doesn't overlap with their busy periods.\n\nLet me list out all the available slots for both. For James, the blocked times are 11:30-12:00 and 14:30-15:00. So the available time before 11:30 is from 9:00 to 11:30. But John is busy from 9:30 to 11:00, so James can only meet John after 11:00. However, James is busy from 11:30 onwards, so the only possible time before that is 11:00 to 11:30. But John is busy until 11:30, so that doesn't work.\n\nNext, looking at the time after John's busy periods. John is free from 13:30 to 14:30 and again from 16:30 to 17:00. James is free from 15:00 onwards, except his blocked time at 14:30-15:00. So maybe the meeting can happen at 13:30-14:00 or 15:00-16:00. But wait, John is busy from 14:30 to 16:30, so 14:00 to 15:00 is free for John but James is busy until 15:00. So that might not work.\n\nWait, let me double-check. James is free from 15:00 onwards. John is free from 13:30 to 14:30 and then again from 16:30. So perhaps the best time is 15:00 to 16:00. Let me check if both are available then.\n\nJames: He's free from 15:00, but his blocked time is until 15:00, so the meeting can start at 15:00. John: He's free from 16:30 onwards, but the meeting needs to be an hour. So starting at 15:00, the meeting would end at 16:00, which is before John's next busy time. So that works.\n\nAlternatively, could we start earlier? John is free at 13:30, but James is busy until 14:30. So maybe 13:30 to 14:00? But James is busy until 14:30, so he can't start before 14:30. So the meeting would have to start at 14:30, but James is busy until 15:00, so that doesn't work.\n\nSo the only feasible time is 15:00 to 16:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Define the work hours\nstart_work = (9, 30)\nend_work = (17, 0)\n\n# Define the blocked times for each participant\njames_blocked = [(11, 30), (14, 30)]\njohn_blocked = [(9, 30), (11, 30), (12, 30), (14, 30), (16, 30)]\n\n# Convert blocked times to minutes since 00:00\ndef to_minutes(time):\n    return time[0] * 60 + time[1]\n\njames_blocked_mins = [to_minutes(t) for t in james_blocked]\njohn_blocked_mins = [to_minutes(t) for t in john_blocked]\n\n# Find the earliest available time slot that fits the meeting duration\nmeeting_duration = 60\ncurrent_time = start_work\nday_of_week = \"Monday\"\n\nwhile True:\n    # Convert current_time to minutes\n    current_mins = current_time[0] * 60 + current_time[1]\n    \n    # Check if there's space for the meeting before the next blocked time\n    next_available = current_mins + meeting_duration\n    next_blocked = None\n    \n    for block in john_blocked_mins + james_blocked_mins:\n        if block >= current_mins:\n            if next_available < block:\n                next_available = block - meeting_duration\n                next_blocked = block\n                break\n        else:\n            if next_available < block:\n                next_available = block - meeting_duration\n                next_blocked = block\n                break\n    \n    # If found a suitable slot, break the loop\n    if next_blocked is not None:\n        break\n    \n    # Move to the next hour if no slot is found\n    if current_time[1] == 59:\n        current_time = (current_time[0] + 1, 0)\n    else:\n        current_time = (current_time[0], current_time[1] + 1)\n\n# Convert next_available back to hours and minutes\nstart_hh, start_mm = divmod(next_available, 60)\nend_hh, end_mm = divmod(next_available + meeting_duration, 60)\n\n# Format the output\nprint(f\"{start_hh:02}:{start_mm:02}:{end_hh:02}:{end_mm:02}\")\nprint(f\"{day_of_week}\")\n```",
