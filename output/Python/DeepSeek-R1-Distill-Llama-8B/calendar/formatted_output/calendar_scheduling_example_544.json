            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting between Deborah and Albert on Monday. Deborah is completely free all day, which is a big help. Albert, on the other hand, has some blocked times that I need to avoid. Let's see what I can do.\n\nFirst, let me list out Albert's blocked times. He's busy from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, and 15:00 to 16:30 on Monday. Plus, he can't meet after 11:00. So, I need to find a time slot that fits these constraints.\n\nSince the meeting is half an hour long, I'll need to find a 30-minute window that's free for both Deborah and Albert. Deborah being free all day means I just have to focus on Albert's schedule.\n\nI think the best approach is to look at the gaps between Albert's blocked times and see if any of those gaps can accommodate a 30-minute meeting. Also, I need to make sure that the meeting starts before 11:00 because Albert can't meet after that.\n\nLet's break down Albert's schedule:\n\n1. **9:00 to 10:00**: He's busy here, so no meeting before 10:00.\n2. **10:30 to 12:00**: Another busy period. The gap between 10:00 and 10:30 might be a good spot.\n3. **15:00 to 16:30**: He's busy in the late afternoon. The gap between 14:00 and 15:00 could work.\n\nWait, but he can't meet after 11:00. So, any slot after 11:00 needs to be checked against his 15:00 to 16:30 block.\n\nLet me visualize the time slots:\n\n- **9:00-10:00**: Blocked\n- **10:00-10:30**: Free\n- **10:30-12:00**: Blocked\n- **12:00-14:00**: Free\n- **14:00-15:00**: Free\n- **15:00-16:30**: Blocked\n- **16:30-17:00**: Free\n\nNow, considering the meeting is half an hour, let's see where it can fit:\n\n1. **10:00-10:30**: Perfect! There's a 30-minute gap here.\n2. **12:00-14:00**: That's two hours free. Plenty of room for a 30-minute meeting.\n3. **14:00-15:00**: Another 60-minute gap. A 30-minute meeting fits here.\n4. **16:30-17:00**: Only 30 minutes free, which is exactly what we need.\n\nBut wait, the meeting has to start before 11:00. So, the 12:00 slot is after 11:00. Let me check if 10:00-10:30 is feasible. It starts at 10:00, which is before 11:00, so that's good.\n\nHowever, Albert can't meet after 11:00, so starting at 10:00 is fine. But Deborah is free all day, so she doesn't mind.\n\nAlternatively, starting at 14:00 would also work because that's before 15:00 when Albert is busy again. So, the 14:00-14:30 slot is available.\n\nBut the earliest possible time would be better. So, 10:00 seems like the best option.\n\nWait, but the meeting is half an hour. So, from 10:00 to 10:30. That fits perfectly in the 10:00-10:30 gap.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I choose 10:00, that's within his blocked time. No, wait, his blocked time starts at 10:00, so the meeting can't start at 10:00 because he's busy then.\n\nOh, I see. So, the gap is from 10:00 to 10:30, but he's busy at 10:00. So, the meeting can't start at 10:00 exactly. It has to start after 10:00.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. So, the earliest possible start time would be 10:30, but that's when his next blocked time starts. So, that's not available.\n\nWait, no. His blocked time is from 10:30 to 12:00. So, the gap is from 10:00 to 10:30. But he's busy at 10:00, so the meeting can't start at 10:00. It has to start after 10:00 but before 10:30.\n\nSo, the latest it can start is 10:29:59, which is practically 10:30. But that's the same as his blocked time. So, maybe that slot isn't available.\n\nThen, the next available slot would be after his blocked time from 12:00 to 14:00. So, starting at 12:00, we can have a 30-minute meeting.\n\nAlternatively, starting at 14:00 would also work because he's free from 14:00 to 15:00.\n\nSo, the earliest possible time would be 12:00, but let me check if that's feasible.\n\nFrom 12:00 to 12:30, that's a 30-minute slot. Perfect.\n\nAlternatively, starting at 14:00 would give us 14:00 to 14:30, which is also good.\n\nBut since 12:00 is earlier, that's better.\n\nWait, but after 11:00, he can't meet. So, starting at 12:00 is after 11:00, which is fine because he can't meet after 11:00, but he's free from 12:00 onwards.\n\nSo, 12:00 seems like a good time.\n\nAlternatively, 14:00 is also possible, but 12:00 is earlier.\n\nWait, but his blocked time is until 12:00, so from 12:00 onwards, he's free until 14:00.\n\nSo, the meeting can start at 12:00.\n\nBut let me make sure. His blocked times are:\n\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 10:30-12:00\n- 15:00-16:30\n\nSo, the gaps are:\n\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 12:00-14:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nSo, the available slots are:\n\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 12:00-14:00\n- 14:00-15:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nBut considering the meeting has to be half an hour and start before 11:00, the only slot that fits is 10:00-10:30, but he's busy at 10:00, so the meeting can't start at 10:00. It has to start after 10:00 but before 10:30.\n\nSo, the latest it can start is 10:29:59, which is practically 10:30, but that's his blocked time. So, that slot isn't available.\n\nTherefore, the next available slot is 12:00-12:30.\n\nSo, the meeting can start at 12:00.\n\nAlternatively, starting at 14:00 would also work, but 12:00 is earlier.\n\nSo, 12:00 seems like the best option.\n\nWait, but his blocked time ends at 12:00, so he's free from 12:00 onwards.\n\nSo, starting at 12:00 is fine.\n\nBut let me make sure that the meeting doesn't conflict with his blocked times.\n\nFrom 12:00 to 12:30, that's within his free time.\n\nSo, that should work.\n\nAlternatively, starting at 14:00 is also possible, but 12:00 is earlier.\n\nSo, I think 12:00 is the best time to schedule the meeting.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf I choose 12:00, the meeting ends at 12:30, which is before his next blocked time at 14:00.\n\nWait, no. His blocked time is from 10:30 to 12:00, so after 12:00, he's free until 14:00.\n\nSo, 12:00 is a good time.\n\nAlternatively, starting at 14:00 would also work, but 12:00 is earlier.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled at 12:00-12:30.\n\nBut let me make sure that this doesn't conflict with any other constraints.\n\nDeborah is free all day, so she doesn't have any conflicts.\n\nAlbert's blocked times are as given, and 12:00-12:30 is within his free time.\n\nSo, that should work.\n\nAlternatively, starting at 14:00 would also work, but 12:00 is earlier.\n\nSo, I think 12:00 is the best time.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that Albert can't meet after 11:00. So, starting at 12:00 is after 11:00, which is allowed because he can't meet after 11:00, but he's free from 12:00 onwards.\n\nSo, that's fine.\n\nTherefore, the meeting can be scheduled at 12:00-12:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Define the work hours\nstart_work = (9, 0)\nend_work = (17, 0)\n\n# Define the blocked times for each participant\ndeborah_blocked = []\nalbert_blocked = [(9, 0), (10, 30), (12, 0), (15, 0)]\n\n# Convert blocked times to minutes since 00:00\ndef to_minutes(time):\n    return time[0] * 60 + time[1]\n\ndeborah_blocked_mins = [to_minutes(t) for t in debarah_blocked]\nalbert_blocked_mins = [to_minutes(t) for t in albert_blocked]\n\n# Find the earliest available time slot that fits the meeting duration\nmeeting_duration = 30\ncurrent_time = start_work\nday_of_week = \"Monday\"\n\nwhile True:\n    # Convert current_time to minutes\n    current_mins = current_time[0] * 60 + current_time[1]\n    \n    # Check if there's space for the meeting before the next blocked time\n    next_available = current_mins + meeting_duration\n    next_blocked = None\n    \n    for block in albert_blocked_mins:\n        if block >= current_mins:\n            if next_available < block:\n                next_available = block - meeting_duration\n                next_blocked = block\n                break\n        else:\n            if next_available < block:\n                next_available = block - meeting_duration\n                next_blocked = block\n                break\n    \n    # If found a suitable slot, break the loop\n    if next_blocked is not None:\n        break\n    \n    # Move to the next hour if no slot is found\n    if current_time[1] == 59:\n        current_time = (current_time[0] + 1, 0)\n    else:\n        current_time = (current_time[0], current_time[1] + 1)\n\n# Convert next_available back to hours and minutes\nstart_hh, start_mm = divmod(next_available, 60)\nend_hh, end_mm = divmod(next_available + meeting_duration, 60)\n\n# Format the output\nprint(f\"{start_hh:02}:{start_mm:02}:{end_hh:02}:{end_mm:02}\")\nprint(f\"{day_of_week}\")\n```",
