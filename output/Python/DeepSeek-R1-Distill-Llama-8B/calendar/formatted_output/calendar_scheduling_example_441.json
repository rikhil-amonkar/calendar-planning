            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to help schedule a meeting for Joan, Megan, Austin, Betty, Judith, Terry, and Kathryn on Monday. The meeting should last half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00. Let me look at each person's schedule to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the blocked times for each person on Monday.\n\nJoan is busy from 11:30 to 12:00 and 14:30 to 15:00. So, those times are off the table.\n\nMegan has meetings from 9:00 to 10:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 16:00 to 16:30. So, I need to avoid those slots.\n\nAustin is free the entire day, so no conflicts there.\n\nBetty is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, and 16:00 to 16:30. Those times are blocked.\n\nJudith has blocked times from 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, and 14:00 to 15:00. So, the meeting can't overlap with those periods.\n\nTerry is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. I need to avoid those times.\n\nKathryn is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, I need to check against those blocks.\n\nNow, I'll go through the possible time slots from 9:00 to 17:00 in half-hour increments and check if any slot is free for all participants.\n\nStarting from 9:00, the first slot is 9:00 to 9:30. But Megan is busy from 9:00 to 10:00, so this slot is blocked.\n\nNext, 9:30 to 10:00. Both Megan and Kathryn are busy during this time, so it's not available.\n\n10:00 to 10:30. Let's check each person:\n\n- Joan: Not busy\n- Megan: Not busy (she's free between 10:00 and 14:00)\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Not busy\n- Judith: Busy until 11:00\n- Terry: Busy until 10:00\n- Kathryn: Busy until 10:30\n\nSince Terry is busy until 10:00, the slot ends at 10:30, but Terry's block ends at 10:00. Wait, no, Terry is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, so the meeting at 10:00 to 10:30 would start after Terry's busy time. But let me double-check. If the meeting starts at 10:00, it would conflict with Terry's meeting until 10:00. So, maybe this slot is partially conflicting. It's better to skip this to avoid any issues.\n\nNext slot: 10:30 to 11:00. Let's check:\n\n- Joan: Not busy\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Not busy\n- Judith: Busy until 11:00\n- Terry: Busy until 11:30\n- Kathryn: Busy until 11:00\n\nSince Judith and Kathryn are busy until 11:00, the meeting can't start at 10:30.\n\nNext: 11:00 to 11:30. Check each person:\n\n- Joan: Busy from 11:30 to 12:00, so this slot is free.\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Not busy\n- Judith: Busy until 12:00\n- Terry: Busy until 11:30\n- Kathryn: Busy until 11:30\n\nTerry and Kathryn are busy until 11:30, so the meeting can't start at 11:00.\n\nNext slot: 11:30 to 12:00. Let's check:\n\n- Joan: Busy until 12:00\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Not busy\n- Judith: Busy until 12:00\n- Terry: Busy until 12:30\n- Kathryn: Busy until 12:30\n\nJoan and Judith are busy until 12:00, so the meeting can't start at 11:30.\n\nNext: 12:00 to 12:30. Check each person:\n\n- Joan: Free\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Not busy\n- Judith: Busy until 12:00, so free after 12:00\n- Terry: Busy until 12:30\n- Kathryn: Busy until 12:30\n\nTerry and Kathryn are busy until 12:30, so the meeting can't start at 12:00.\n\nNext slot: 12:30 to 13:00. Let's check:\n\n- Joan: Free\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Not busy\n- Judith: Free\n- Terry: Busy until 13:00\n- Kathryn: Busy until 13:00\n\nTerry and Kathryn are busy until 13:00, so the meeting can't start at 12:30.\n\nNext: 13:00 to 13:30. Check each person:\n\n- Joan: Free\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Busy until 13:30\n- Judith: Free\n- Terry: Busy until 13:00\n- Kathryn: Busy until 13:00\n\nBetty is busy until 13:30, so the meeting can't start at 13:00.\n\nNext slot: 13:30 to 14:00. Check each person:\n\n- Joan: Free\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Busy until 14:00\n- Judith: Free\n- Terry: Busy until 14:00\n- Kathryn: Busy until 14:00\n\nBetty, Terry, and Kathryn are busy until 14:00, so the meeting can't start at 13:30.\n\nNext: 14:00 to 14:30. Let's check:\n\n- Joan: Busy from 14:30 to 15:00, so free before 14:30\n- Megan: Busy from 14:00 to 14:30\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Busy until 14:00\n- Judith: Busy until 14:00\n- Terry: Busy until 14:00\n- Kathryn: Busy until 14:00\n\nMegan is busy during this slot, so it's not available.\n\nNext slot: 14:30 to 15:00. Check each person:\n\n- Joan: Busy until 15:00\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Not busy\n- Judith: Busy until 15:00\n- Terry: Not busy (Terry is busy from 15:00 to 15:30)\n- Kathryn: Not busy\n\nWait, let me check Kathryn's schedule. Kathryn is busy from 14:00 to 16:00, so 14:30 to 15:00 is within that block. So, the meeting can't start at 14:30.\n\nNext slot: 15:00 to 15:30. Check each person:\n\n- Joan: Busy until 15:00\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Not busy\n- Judith: Busy until 15:00\n- Terry: Busy from 15:00 to 15:30\n- Kathryn: Busy until 16:00\n\nTerry is busy during this slot, so it's not available.\n\nNext: 15:30 to 16:00. Check each person:\n\n- Joan: Free\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Not busy\n- Judith: Free\n- Terry: Not busy (Terry is free after 15:30)\n- Kathryn: Busy until 16:00\n\nKathryn is busy until 16:00, so the meeting can't start at 15:30.\n\nNext slot: 16:00 to 16:30. Let's check:\n\n- Joan: Free\n- Megan: Busy from 16:00 to 16:30\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Busy until 16:30\n- Judith: Free\n- Terry: Free\n- Kathryn: Busy until 16:30\n\nMegan and Betty are busy during this slot, so it's not available.\n\nNext: 16:30 to 17:00. Check each person:\n\n- Joan: Free\n- Megan: Not busy\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Not busy\n- Judith: Free\n- Terry: Free\n- Kathryn: Busy until 17:00\n\nKathryn is busy until 17:00, so the meeting can't start at 16:30.\n\nWait, I've checked all the possible slots and none seem to work. Did I miss something? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back, maybe I made a mistake with Kathryn's schedule. Kathryn is busy from 14:00 to 16:00, so 14:30 to 15:00 is within that block. Also, at 16:00 to 16:30, Kathryn is busy until 17:00.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the meeting can end after Kathryn's busy time. Let me check the latest possible slot.\n\nIf the meeting starts at 16:30, it would end at 17:00. But Kathryn is busy until 17:00, so that's a conflict. So, the meeting can't start at 16:30.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for a slot that ends before Kathryn's busy time. Let me check the 16:00 to 16:30 slot again. Megan is busy during that time, so it's not available.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any participant has a free slot that I missed. Let me go through each person's schedule again.\n\nJoan: 11:30-12:00 and 14:30-15:00 are busy. So, she's free from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nMegan: 9:00-10:00, 14:00-14:30, 16:00-16:30 are busy. So, she's free from 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:00-11:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:00-13:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:00-15:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nAustin: Entire day is free.\n\nBetty: 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:30-14:00, 16:00-16:30 are busy. So, she's free from 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:00-15:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nJudith: 9:00-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 14:00-15:00 are busy. So, she's free from 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 15:00-16:00, 16:00-17:00.\n\nTerry: 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-14:00, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00 are busy. So, he's free from 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nKathryn: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-13:00, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00 are busy. So, she's free from 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 13:00-14:00, 16:00-16:30, 17:00-17:30.\n\nNow, let's look for a half-hour slot where all seven people are free.\n\nLooking at 10:00-10:30:\n\n- Joan: Free\n- Megan: Free\n- Austin: Free\n- Betty: Free\n- Judith: Free\n- Terry: Free\n- Kathryn: Free\n\nThis seems to be a possible slot. Let me confirm:\n\n- Joan is free from 10:00-10:30.\n- Megan is free from 10:00-10:30.\n- Austin is free the entire day.\n- Betty is free from 10:00-10:30.\n- Judith is free from 11:00-12:00, so 10:00-10:30 is free.\n- Terry is free from 10:00-10:30.\n- Kathryn is free from 10:00-10:30.\n\nYes, 10:00-10:30 seems to work for everyone. I think that's the best slot available.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    work_hours = [(9, 17)]  # Monday\n    # Meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n    \n    # Blocked times for each person on Monday\n    blocked_times = {\n        'Joan': {\n            'Monday': [(11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60), (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60)]\n        },\n        'Megan': {\n            'Monday': [(9 * 60, 10 * 60), (14 * 60, 14 * 60 + 30), (16 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)]\n        },\n        'Austin': {\n            'Monday': []\n        },\n        'Betty': {\n            'Monday': [(9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60), (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60), (13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60), (16 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)]\n        },\n        'Judith': {\n            'Monday': [(9 * 60, 11 * 60), (12 * 60, 13 * 60), (14 * 60, 15 * 60)]\n        },\n        'Terry': {\n            'Monday': [(9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60), (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60 + 30), (13 * 60, 14 * 60), (15 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30), (16 * 60, 17 * 60)]\n        },\n        'Kathryn': {\n            'Monday': [(9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60), (10 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60), (11 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60), (14 * 60, 16 * 60), (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)]\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Check each time slot in the working hours\n    for hour in range(9, 17):\n        for minute in range(0, 60):\n            start = hour * 60 + minute\n            end = start + duration\n            \n            # Check if the time slot is within working hours\n            if start < 9 * 60 or end > 17 * 60:\n                continue\n            \n            # Check against each person's blocked times\n            all_available = True\n            for person in ['Joan', 'Megan', 'Austin', 'Betty', 'Judith', 'Terry', 'Kathryn']:\n                if person in blocked_times and start // 60 == 9 and end // 60 == 17:\n                    for block_start, block_end in blocked_times[person]['Monday']:\n                        if block_start <= start < block_end:\n                            all_available = False\n                            break\n                    if not all_available:\n                        break\n            \n            if all_available:\n                print(f\"{start // 60:02d}:{start % 60:02d}-{end // 60:02d}:{end % 60:02d} Monday\")\n                return f\"{start // 60:02d}:{start % 60:02d}-{end // 60:02d}:{end % 60:02d} Monday\"\n    \n    # If no slot is found, return an error message\n    return \"No available time found.\"\n```",
