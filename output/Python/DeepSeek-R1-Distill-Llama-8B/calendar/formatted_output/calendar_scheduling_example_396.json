Let's see what their schedules look like.\n\nFirst, Andrea's calendar is completely open, so she's available the entire day from 9:00 to 17:00. That's good because it gives me more flexibility.\n\nNext, let's look at Jack. He has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30 and again from 14:00 to 14:30. So, Jack is busy during those two time blocks. That means the meeting can't overlap with those times.\n\nMadison has several blocked times: 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, Madison is busy during those periods and available in the gaps between them.\n\nRachel is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. So, Rachel has several busy blocks throughout the day.\n\nDouglas is busy from 9:00 to 11:30 and from 12:00 to 16:30. That leaves Douglas available from 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nRyan has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 17:00. So, Ryan is busy during those times and available otherwise.\n\nNow, I need to find a half-hour window where all six people are free. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the time blocks where each person is free.\n\nAndrea is free from 9:00 to 17:00.\n\nJack is free from 9:30 to 9:30 (wait, that doesn't make sense. He's busy from 9:00 to 9:30, so he's free from 9:30 onwards until 14:00, and then again from 14:30 to 17:00.\n\nMadison is free from 11:00 to 9:30, which doesn't make sense either. Wait, no, Madison is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, so she's free from 10:30 to 13:00, then busy again from 13:00 to 14:00, free from 14:00 to 15:00, and busy from 15:00 to 15:30, then free from 15:30 to 16:30, and busy again from 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nRachel is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, so she's free from 10:30 to 11:00, then busy from 11:00 to 11:30, free from 11:30 to 12:00, busy from 12:00 to 13:30, free from 13:30 to 14:00, busy from 14:00 to 15:30, free from 15:30 to 16:00, and busy from 16:00 to 17:00.\n\nDouglas is busy from 9:00 to 11:30, so he's free from 11:30 to 12:00, then busy again from 12:00 to 16:30, so free from 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nRyan is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, so free from 9:30 to 13:00, busy from 13:00 to 14:00, free from 14:00 to 14:30, busy again from 14:30 to 17:00, so free from 17:00 onwards, but our meeting ends by 17:00.\n\nNow, let's find the overlapping free time for all.\n\nLooking at the free times:\n\nAndrea: 9:00 to 17:00\n\nJack: 9:30 to 9:30 (free until 14:00), then 14:30 to 17:00\n\nMadison: 10:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30\n\nRachel: 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00\n\nDouglas: 11:30 to 12:00, 16:30 to 17:00\n\nRyan: 9:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30\n\nSo, let's look for a half-hour window where all are free.\n\nStarting from 9:30:\n\nJack is free from 9:30 onwards.\n\nRyan is free from 9:30 to 13:00.\n\nMadison is free from 10:30 onwards.\n\nRachel is free from 10:30 onwards.\n\nDouglas is free from 11:30 onwards.\n\nAndrea is always free.\n\nSo, the earliest possible time after 9:30 when everyone is free is 10:30.\n\nFrom 10:30 to 11:00:\n\nCheck if all are free.\n\nJack: 10:30 is after 9:30, so he's free until 14:00.\n\nMadison: free from 10:30.\n\nRachel: free from 10:30.\n\nDouglas: not free until 11:30.\n\nSo, at 10:30, Douglas is still busy until 11:30.\n\nTherefore, 10:30 to 11:00 is not available.\n\nNext, 11:00 to 11:30:\n\nJack: free.\n\nMadison: free.\n\nRachel: free from 11:00.\n\nDouglas: free from 11:30.\n\nSo, at 11:00, Douglas is still busy until 11:30.\n\nThus, 11:00 to 11:30 is not available.\n\nNext, 11:30 to 12:00:\n\nJack: free.\n\nMadison: free.\n\nRachel: free.\n\nDouglas: free from 11:30.\n\nAndrea: free.\n\nSo, this seems like a possible slot.\n\nCheck if this slot is free for all.\n\nFrom 11:30 to 12:00:\n\nJack: free.\n\nMadison: free.\n\nRachel: free.\n\nDouglas: free.\n\nAndrea: free.\n\nYes, this slot works.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 11:30 to 12:00.\n\nAlternatively, let's check later slots to see if there's an earlier one.\n\nWait, from 10:30 to 11:00, Douglas is busy until 11:30, so 10:30-11:00 is not available.\n\nFrom 11:00 to 11:30, Douglas is busy until 11:30, so 11:00-11:30 is not available.\n\nFrom 11:30 to 12:00, everyone is free.\n\nSo, 11:30 to 12:00 is the earliest available slot.\n\nTherefore, the meeting should be scheduled from 11:30 to 12:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Define the meeting duration in hours\nmeeting_duration = 30  # 0.5 hours in minutes\n\n# Function to convert time string to minutes since 9:00\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n# Function to convert minutes back to time string\ndef minutes_to_time(m):\n    hours = m // 60\n    minutes = m % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n# Define the days in order: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday\ndays = ['Monday']\n\n# Schedules for each participant\nandrea_schedule = {'Monday': []}\njack_schedule = {\n    'Monday': [\n        (0, 30),  # 9:00-9:30\n        (840, 900)  # 14:00-14:30\n    ]\n}\nmadison_schedule = {\n    'Monday': [\n        (210, 240),  # 9:30-10:30\n        (630, 690),  # 13:00-14:00\n        (900, 930),  # 15:00-15:30\n        (1050, 1170) # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n}\nrachel_schedule = {\n    'Monday': [\n        (150, 180),  # 9:30-10:30\n        (330, 360),  # 11:00-11:30\n        (420, 450),  # 12:00-12:30\n        (690, 750),  # 13:30-14:00\n        (900, 930),  # 15:00-15:30\n        (1020, 1080) # 16:00-17:00\n    ]\n}\ndouglas_schedule = {\n    'Monday': [\n        (0, 690),  # 9:00-11:30\n        (780, 1170) # 12:00-16:30\n    ]\n}\nryan_schedule = {\n    'Monday': [\n        (0, 30),  # 9:00-9:30\n        (630, 690),  # 13:00-14:00\n        (900, 1170) # 14:30-17:00\n    ]\n}\n\n# Function to find the first available meeting time\ndef find_meeting_time(schedules, meeting_duration):\n    for day in days:\n        # Get free times for this day\n        free_times = [schedule[day] for schedule in schedules]\n        \n        # Check possible start times from 9:00 to 16:30 (9:00 is 0, 16:30 is 990 minutes)\n        for start in range(0, 990 -
