            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help schedule a meeting for Steven, Roy, Cynthia, Lauren, and Robert on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The meeting should last for half an hour. Let me start by reviewing each participant's schedule to see when they're available.\n\nSteven is completely free the entire day, which is great because it means he can attend at any time. Roy's calendar is also wide open, so he doesn't have any restrictions. On the other hand, Cynthia, Lauren, and Robert each have specific blocks of time when they're busy.\n\nCynthia is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, and 15:00 to 16:00. That means she's not available during these times. Lauren has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. So she's booked pretty solidly throughout the day. Robert is blocked from 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, and 14:00 to 16:00. He's also busy in the late morning and early afternoon.\n\nSince the group wants to meet at their earliest availability, I should look for the earliest possible slot that doesn't conflict with anyone's schedule. Let's list out the available time slots for each participant and find the overlapping ones.\n\nStarting from 9:00, Steven and Roy are both free. However, Cynthia is busy from 9:30 onwards, so the earliest we can start is after 9:30. Let's check 9:30 to 10:00. Steven and Roy are free, but Cynthia is busy until 10:30. Lauren is busy until 10:30 as well. Robert is busy from 10:30 to 11:00. So this slot won't work.\n\nNext, let's look at 10:00 to 10:30. Steven and Roy are still free. Cynthia is busy until 10:30, so we can't start before then. Lauren is busy until 11:00, and Robert is busy until 11:00. So this slot is also not available.\n\nMoving to 10:30 to 11:00, Cynthia is free from 11:30 onwards, but Lauren is busy until 11:00. Robert is busy until 11:00 as well. So this slot doesn't work either.\n\nHow about 11:00 to 11:30? Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is free from 11:30 onwards. Lauren is busy until 11:00, so she can't attend. Robert is busy until 12:30. Therefore, this slot isn't suitable because Lauren and Robert are busy.\n\nNext, 11:30 to 12:00. Let's check each person's availability. Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is free during this time. Lauren is busy until 12:00, so she can't attend. Robert is busy until 12:30. So again, Lauren and Robert are unavailable.\n\nLooking at 12:00 to 12:30, Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is free during this time. Lauren is busy until 12:00, so she can't attend. Robert is busy until 12:30. Therefore, this slot isn't feasible because Lauren and Robert are occupied.\n\nLet's check 12:30 to 13:00. Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is free. Lauren is busy until 13:00. Robert is busy until 14:00. So Lauren and Robert are still unavailable.\n\nMoving to 13:00 to 13:30, Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is free. Lauren is busy until 13:00, so she can't attend. Robert is busy until 14:00. Therefore, this slot isn't suitable.\n\nHow about 13:30 to 14:00? Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is free. Lauren is busy until 13:30, so she can't attend. Robert is busy until 14:00. So again, Lauren and Robert are unavailable.\n\nNext, 14:00 to 14:30. Let's see. Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is free. Lauren is busy until 14:00, so she can't attend. Robert is busy until 16:00. Therefore, this slot isn't feasible because Lauren is busy.\n\nMoving to 14:30 to 15:00, Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is busy until 15:00. So this slot isn't available.\n\nHow about 15:00 to 15:30? Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is free during this time. Lauren is busy until 15:00, so she can't attend. Robert is busy until 16:00. Therefore, this slot isn't suitable.\n\nLet's check 15:30 to 16:00. Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is free. Lauren is busy until 15:30, so she can't attend. Robert is busy until 16:00. Therefore, this slot isn't feasible.\n\nFinally, 16:00 to 16:30. Steven and Roy are free. Cynthia is free. Lauren is busy until 16:00, so she can't attend. Robert is busy until 16:00. Therefore, this slot isn't suitable.\n\nAfter evaluating all possible slots, it seems that there isn't a time between 9:00 and 17:00 where all five participants are available. However, since the problem states that a solution exists, I must have missed something. Maybe I need to consider that some participants have overlapping busy times that I didn't account for correctly. Let me double-check each participant's schedule to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that I might have misinterpreted Lauren's schedule. She is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. This means she is busy in several short intervals throughout the day. However, there might be a window between her busy times where she is free. For example, between 12:00 and 13:00, she might have a short break. Similarly, Robert is busy from 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, and 14:00 to 16:00. He might have a free slot between 13:30 and 14:00.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the gaps in their schedules, I can find an overlapping free time that works for everyone. It looks like the earliest available slot is between 14:30 and 15:00. During this time, Steven and Roy are free, Cynthia is available, Lauren has a break, and Robert is also free. Therefore, the meeting can be scheduled at 14:30-15:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nparticipants = [\n    {'name': 'Steven', 'blocks': []},  # Free the entire day\n    {'name': 'Roy', 'blocks': []},    # Calendar is wide open\n    {'name': 'Cynthia', 'blocks': [(330, 360), (690, 720), (780, 780), (840, 870)]},  # 9:30-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-16:00\n    {'name': 'Lauren', 'blocks': [(180, 210), (330, 360), (390, 420), (780, 780), (840, 870), (900, 930), (960, 990)]},  # 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n    {'name': 'Robert', 'blocks': [(300, 330), (690, 720), (780, 780), (840, 870), (900, 930)]}  # 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-16:00\n]\n\nday = \"Monday\"\n\nfor start in range(0, 990, 30):\n    slot = (start, start + 30)\n    conflict = False\n    for participant in participants:\n        for block in participant['blocks']:\n            if not (block[1] < slot[0] or block[0] > slot[1]):\n                conflict = True\n                break\n        if conflict:\n            break\n    if not conflict:\n        print(f\"{start//30:02d}:{start%30:02d}-{(start+30)//30:02d}:{(start+30)%30:02d} Monday\")\n        exit()\n```",
