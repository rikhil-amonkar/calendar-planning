The meeting should be half an hour long between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Each person has their own schedule, and I need to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each person's schedule and see where they're free. Let's start with Emily. She has meetings from 10:00 to 10:30 and again from 16:00 to 16:30. So, she's busy during those times, but she's free before 10:00, between 10:30 and 16:00, and after 16:30.\n\nNext, Mason is free the entire day, which is helpful because that gives us more flexibility. Maria has meetings from 10:30 to 11:00 and again from 14:00 to 14:30. So, she's busy during those slots, but free otherwise.\n\nCarl has a lot of meetings: 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. That leaves Carl free from 12:00 to 13:30 and from 15:00 to 16:00. \n\nDavid is blocked from 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 17:00. So, David is free from 13:30 to 14:00 and from 15:00 to 16:00.\n\nFrank has meetings from 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, and 14:30 to 17:00. That means Frank is free from 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, and from 13:30 to 14:30.\n\nNow, I'll need to find a 30-minute slot that doesn't overlap with anyone's busy times. Let's look at the gaps between their meetings.\n\nStarting from 9:00, Emily is free until 10:00. But Mason is free all day, Maria is free until 10:30, Carl is free until 9:30, David is free until 9:30, and Frank is free until 9:30. So, the earliest possible time is after 9:30.\n\nLooking at the time slots:\n\n- 9:30 to 10:00: Carl is busy, Frank is busy, David is busy, Emily is free, Maria is free, Mason is free. But since some are busy, this slot isn't available.\n- 10:00 to 10:30: Emily is busy, Maria is free until 10:30, Carl is busy until 10:30, David is busy until 11:00, Frank is free until 10:30. So, this slot might be possible, but Emily is busy, so it's not available.\n- 10:30 to 11:00: Emily is free, Maria is busy, Carl is busy until 12:30, David is busy until 11:30, Frank is free until 11:00. So, this slot is partially free but not entirely.\n- 11:00 to 11:30: David is busy until 12:00, Frank is busy until 11:30. So, this slot is not free.\n- 11:30 to 12:00: David is busy until 12:00, Frank is free until 12:30. So, this slot is partially free.\n- 12:00 to 12:30: Carl is free, David is busy until 12:30, Maria is free, Frank is free until 12:30. So, this slot might be possible.\n- 12:30 to 13:00: Carl is busy until 13:30, David is busy until 13:30, Frank is busy until 13:30. So, this slot is not free.\n- 13:00 to 13:30: Carl is busy until 14:00, David is busy until 14:00. So, this slot is not free.\n- 14:00 to 14:30: Maria is busy, Carl is busy until 15:00, David is busy until 15:00, Frank is busy until 17:00. So, this slot is not free.\n- 15:00 to 15:30: Carl is busy until 16:00, David is busy until 16:00, Frank is busy until 17:00. So, this slot is not free.\n- 16:00 to 16:30: Emily is busy, David is busy until 17:00, Frank is busy until 17:00. So, this slot is not free.\n\nAfter checking all these slots, the only time that works for everyone is between 12:00 and 12:30. This slot is free for Emily, Mason, Maria, Carl, David, and Frank. So, the meeting can be scheduled from 12:00 to 12:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    start_time = datetime.time(9)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17)\n    \n    # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 for easier calculations\n    def time_to_min(t):\n        return t.hour * 60 + t.minute\n    \n    # Define each person's busy periods as sets of minutes since 9:00\n    emily = {\n        (600, 30),  # 10:00-10:30\n        (960, 30)   # 16:00-16:30\n    }\n    \n    mason = set()\n    \n    maria = {\n        (690, 30),  # 10:30-11:00\n        (840, 30)   # 14:00-14:30\n    }\n    \n    carl = {\n        (570, 30),  # 9:30-10:00\n        (690, 90),  # 10:30-12:30\n        (1050, 30), # 13:30-14:00\n        (1380, 30), # 14:30-15:00\n        (1800, 60)  # 16:00-17:00\n    }\n    \n    david = {\n        (570, 60),  # 9:30-11:00\n        (690, 30),  # 11:30-12:00\n        (780, 60),  # 12:30-13:30\n        (840, 60),  # 14:00-15:00\n        (1800, 60)  # 16:00-17:00\n    }\n    \n    frank = {\n        (570, 60),  # 9:30-10:30\n        (690, 30),  # 11:00-11:30\n        (780, 90),  # 12:30-13:30\n        (1380, 150) # 14:30-17:00\n    }\n    \n    # Convert busy times to sets for easier checking\n    emily = set(emily for t in emily for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    mason = set()\n    maria = set(maria for t in maria for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    carl = set(carl for t in carl for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    david = set(david for t in david for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    frank = set(frank for t in frank for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    \n    # Check each possible time slot\n    for minute in range(540, 1080):  # 9:00 to 16:30 in 10-minute increments\n        if minute % 10 != 0:\n            continue\n        start = datetime.time(9, (minute // 10) % 6)\n        end = start + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\n        if end > datetime.time(17):\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the time slot is free for everyone\n        all_free = True\n        for person in [emily, mason, maria, carl, david, frank]:\n            if minute in person:\n                all_free = False\n                break\n        if all_free:\n            print(f\"{start.hour}:{start.minute}:{end.hour}:{end.minute} {start.weekday()}\")\n            return\n    \n    # If no slot found (though problem says there is one)\n    print(\"No available time found\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
