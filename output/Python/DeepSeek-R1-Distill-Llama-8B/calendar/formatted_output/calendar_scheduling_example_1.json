            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy, and Donald between 9 AM and 5 PM on Monday. Each of them has some existing meetings or blocked times, and Billy especially wants to avoid any meetings after 3 PM. The meeting is supposed to be half an hour long, and I need to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I should look at each person's schedule separately and see when they're free. Let's start with Raymond. He's blocked from 9:00 to 9:30 AM, then from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, and 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. So, Raymond is free from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM, 12:00 PM to 11:30 AM, 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, and 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I misread it. Let me check again.\n\nRaymond's blocked times are 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:00, 1:00-1:30, and 3:00-3:30. So his free times would be 9:30-10:30, 12:00-11:30 (which is the same as 11:30-12:00, but that's blocked), 1:30-3:00, and 3:30-5:00. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe I should represent his busy times as intervals and then find the gaps.\n\nNext, Billy has meetings from 10:00 to 10:30 AM, 12:00 to 1:00 PM, and 4:30 to 5:00 PM. So Billy is busy during those times and wants to avoid meetings after 3:00 PM. That means after 3:00 PM, he's free until 4:30 PM, but he prefers not to have meetings then. So the latest he's willing to meet is by 3:00 PM.\n\nDonald has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30 AM, 10:00 to 11:00 AM, 1:00 to 2:00 PM, 2:30 to 3:00 PM, and 4:00 to 5:00 PM. So his free times are 9:30-10:00, 11:00-1:00 PM, 3:00-4:00 PM, and 5:00 PM onward.\n\nNow, I need to find a half-hour slot that fits within the work hours and doesn't overlap with anyone's busy times. Also, considering Billy's preference to avoid after 3:00 PM, the latest possible meeting time would be at 3:00 PM.\n\nLet me list out possible time slots:\n\n1. **9:30 AM to 10:00 AM:**\n   - Raymond is free.\n   - Billy is free until 10:00 AM.\n   - Donald is free.\n   - This slot works, but it's early in the day. Maybe there's a better option.\n\n2. **10:00 AM to 10:30 AM:**\n   - Billy is busy until 10:30 AM.\n   - So this slot is out.\n\n3. **10:30 AM to 11:00 AM:**\n   - Raymond is free.\n   - Billy is free after 10:30 AM.\n   - Donald is free.\n   - This is another possible slot.\n\n4. **11:00 AM to 11:30 AM:**\n   - Raymond is free.\n   - Billy is free.\n   - Donald is busy until 11:00 AM.\n   - So this slot is out.\n\n5. **11:30 AM to 12:00 PM:**\n   - Raymond is busy until 12:00 PM.\n   - So this slot is out.\n\n6. **12:00 PM to 12:30 PM:**\n   - Raymond is free.\n   - Billy is busy until 1:00 PM.\n   - Donald is free.\n   - This slot works.\n\n7. **12:30 PM to 1:00 PM:**\n   - Raymond is free.\n   - Billy is busy until 1:00 PM.\n   - Donald is busy until 1:00 PM.\n   - So this slot is out.\n\n8. **1:00 PM to 1:30 PM:**\n   - Raymond is free.\n   - Billy is free after 1:00 PM.\n   - Donald is busy until 2:00 PM.\n   - So this slot is out.\n\n9. **1:30 PM to 2:00 PM:**\n   - Raymond is free.\n   - Billy is free.\n   - Donald is busy until 2:00 PM.\n   - So this slot is out.\n\n10. **2:00 PM to 2:30 PM:**\n    - Raymond is free.\n    - Billy is free.\n    - Donald is free from 3:00 PM onward.\n    - This slot works.\n\n11. **2:30 PM to 3:00 PM:**\n    - Raymond is free.\n    - Billy is free.\n    - Donald is busy until 3:00 PM.\n    - So this slot is out.\n\n12. **3:00 PM to 3:30 PM:**\n    - Raymond is free.\n    - Billy is free.\n    - Donald is free from 3:00 PM onward.\n    - This slot works, but Billy prefers to avoid after 3:00 PM.\n\n13. **3:30 PM to 4:00 PM:**\n    - Raymond is free.\n    - Billy is free.\n    - Donald is free.\n    - This slot works and is after 3:00 PM, which fits Billy's preference.\n\n14. **4:00 PM to 4:30 PM:**\n    - Billy is busy until 4:30 PM.\n    - So this slot is out.\n\n15. **4:30 PM to 5:00 PM:**\n    - Billy is busy until 5:00 PM.\n    - So this slot is out.\n\nLooking at the possible slots, the ones that work are:\n\n- 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM\n- 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM\n- 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM\n- 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM\n- 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM\n- 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM\n\nConsidering Billy's preference to avoid after 3:00 PM, the latest possible slot would be 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. However, if we want to give Billy more flexibility, maybe 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM or 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM would be better. But since Billy is okay with 3:30 PM, that might be the best option to accommodate everyone.\n\nAlternatively, if we look for the latest possible time before 3:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM seems suitable. It's earlier than 3:30 PM and still within Billy's preferred time frame.\n\nSo, the best time to schedule the meeting would be 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM on Monday.\n</think>\n\nTo schedule the meeting for Raymond, Billy, and Donald between 9 AM and 5 PM on Monday, considering each participant's schedule and Billy's preference to avoid meetings after 3 PM, the suitable time is:\n\n**02:00:02:30 on Monday**\n\nThis time slot is free for all three participants and fits within Billy's preferred meeting schedule.",
