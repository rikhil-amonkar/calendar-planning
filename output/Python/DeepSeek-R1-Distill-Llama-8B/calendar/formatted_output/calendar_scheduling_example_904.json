            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to schedule a meeting for Daniel and Bradley. The meeting should last for half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. \n\nFirst, I should look at Daniel's schedule. He's busy on:\n- Monday: 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00\n- Tuesday: 11:00-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n- Wednesday: 9:00-10:00, 14:00-14:30\n- Thursday: 10:30-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00\n- Friday: 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 16:30-17:00\n\nSo Daniel is not available on those specific times on those days. \n\nNow, Bradley's schedule is even more packed. He's busy on:\n- Monday: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-15:00\n- Tuesday: 10:30-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:30-16:30\n- Wednesday: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-17:00\n- Thursday: 9:00-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:30\n- Friday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:30\n\nSo Bradley is also not available during those times on those days.\n\nThe constraints are:\n- Daniel does not want to meet on Wednesday or Thursday.\n- Bradley does not want to meet on Monday or Friday.\n- There's a preference to not meet on Tuesday before 12:00.\n\nGiven these constraints, the possible days left are Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, but with some restrictions.\n\nWait, but Daniel doesn't want to meet on Wednesday or Thursday, so we can eliminate Wednesday and Thursday. That leaves Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. But Bradley doesn't want to meet on Monday or Friday, so the only possible day left is Tuesday.\n\nBut there's a constraint that on Tuesday, meetings should not be before 12:00. So, I need to find a time on Tuesday after 12:00 that works for both Daniel and Bradley.\n\nLet me look at Daniel's Tuesday schedule: he's busy from 11:00-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So Daniel is free from 12:00-13:00 and 14:00-15:00.\n\nBradley's Tuesday schedule: he's busy from 10:30-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:30-16:30. So Bradley is free from 11:00-12:00, 14:00-15:00, and 16:00-17:00.\n\nSo the overlapping free time on Tuesday is from 14:00-15:00.\n\nTherefore, the meeting can be scheduled from 14:00 to 14:30 on Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check:\n\nDaniel's free time on Tuesday is 12:00-13:00 and 14:00-15:00. Bradley's free time is 11:00-12:00, 14:00-15:00, and 16:00-17:00.\n\nSo the overlapping free time is 14:00-15:00.\n\nYes, that works.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days):\n    # Convert schedules to time objects for easier manipulation\n    free_times = []\n    for person in participants:\n        free = []\n        for time in person:\n            start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n            end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n            free.append((start, end))\n        free_times.append(free)\n    \n    # Check each preferred day\n    for day in preferred_days:\n        day_free = True\n        for person in participants:\n            for time in person:\n                if time[0].date() == day.date():\n                    start = time[0]\n                    end = time[1]\n                    if not (end < start + meeting_duration):\n                        day_free = False\n                        break\n            if not day_free:\n                break\n        if day_free:\n            for time in participants[0]:\n                start = time[0]\n                end = time[1]\n                if start.date() == day.date() and end.date() == day.date():\n                    return f\"{start.strftime('%H:%M')}:{end.strftime('%H:%M')}: {day}\"\n    \n    # If no time found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No time found\"\n\n# Example usage\nparticipants = [\n    [\n        (\"09:30\", \"10:30\"),\n        (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"14:00\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"15:00\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"16:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:30\", \"11:00\"),\n        (\"11:30\", \"12:00\"),\n        (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"),\n        (\"14:00\", \"15:00\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"16:30\")\n    ]\n]\n\nmeeting_duration = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\npreferred_days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n\nprint(find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days))\n```",
