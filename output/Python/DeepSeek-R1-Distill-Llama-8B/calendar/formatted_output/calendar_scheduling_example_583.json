            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help Lisa and Anthony find a time to meet on Monday. They both have some busy times during the workday, and I need to find a half-hour slot that works for both of them. Plus, I should look for their earliest availability. Let me start by listing out their blocked times.\n\nFirst, let's see Lisa's schedule. She's busy from 9:00 to 9:30 AM, which is pretty early. Then, she has a meeting from 10:30 to 11:00 AM, which is mid-morning. Her biggest block is from 14:00 to 16:00, which is the afternoon. So Lisa is unavailable from 9-9:30, 10:30-11, and 14-16.\n\nNow, looking at Anthony's schedule. He's busy from 9:00 to 9:30 AM as well. Then, he has a meeting from 11:00 to 11:30 AM. After that, he's busy from 12:30 to 13:30 PM, which is lunchtime. Then, he has another block from 14:00 to 15:00 PM, and again from 15:30 to 16:00 PM. Finally, he's busy from 16:30 to 17:00 PM, right at the end of the workday.\n\nSo, both Lisa and Anthony are busy in the morning and afternoon, but there might be some gaps where they can meet. I need to find a time that doesn't overlap with either of their busy periods.\n\nLet's break it down by time blocks:\n\n- **9:00-9:30 AM**: Both are busy. Can't meet here.\n- **9:30-10:00 AM**: Lisa is busy until 9:30, but Anthony is busy until 9:30. So, no available slot right after 9:30.\n- **10:00-10:30 AM**: Lisa is busy until 10:30. Anthony is busy until 11:00. So, Lisa is free from 10:00-10:30, but Anthony is busy until 11:00. Can't meet here.\n- **10:30-11:00 AM**: Lisa is free here, but Anthony is busy until 11:00. So, no slot.\n- **11:00-11:30 AM**: Anthony is busy until 11:30. Lisa is free, but Anthony is occupied. No slot.\n- **11:30-12:00 PM**: Anthony is busy until 12:30, and Lisa is free. So, Lisa is available here, but Anthony isn't. No slot.\n- **12:00-12:30 PM**: Anthony is busy until 12:30. Lisa is free. No slot.\n- **12:30-13:00 PM**: Anthony is busy until 13:30. Lisa is free. No slot.\n- **13:00-13:30 PM**: Anthony is busy until 13:30. Lisa is free. No slot.\n- **13:30-14:00 PM**: Both are free here. Lisa is free from 14:00-16:00, but Anthony is busy until 14:00. Wait, Anthony is busy from 14:00-15:00. So, from 13:30-14:00, both are free. That's a potential slot.\n\nLet me check if there's a half-hour slot here. 13:30-14:00 is exactly 30 minutes. Perfect.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's an earlier slot. After 11:30 AM, the next available time for Lisa is 14:00-16:00. But Anthony is busy from 14:00-15:00, so that's overlapping. So, the only available slot is 13:30-14:00 PM.\n\nWait, but Anthony is busy from 14:00-15:00, so 14:00 is when his meeting starts. So, the latest we can start is 13:30 to avoid overlapping.\n\nSo, the earliest available time is 13:30-14:00 PM.\n\nI think that's the best time that works for both Lisa and Anthony.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define the work hours for the day (Monday)\n    work_hours = [(9, 0), (17, 0)]  # (start hour, start minute), (end hour, end minute)\n\n    # Define the working day in minutes\n    work_day = 17 * 60 - 9 * 60  # 480 minutes (8 hours)\n\n    # Define the blocked times for each participant\n    lisa_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30),  # 9:00-9:30 AM\n        (10, 30), (11, 0),  # 10:30-11:00 AM\n        (14, 0), (16, 0)    # 2:00-4:00 PM\n    ]\n    anthony_blocked = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30),  # 9:00-9:30 AM\n        (11, 0), (11, 30),  # 11:00-11:30 AM\n        (12, 30), (13, 30),  # 12:30-1:30 PM\n        (14, 0), (15, 0),  # 2:00-3:00 PM\n        (15, 30), (16, 0),  # 3:30-4:00 PM\n        (16, 30), (17, 0)   # 4:30-5:00 PM\n    ]\n\n    # Convert blocked times to minutes for easier comparison\n    lisa_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in lisa_blocked]\n    anthony_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in anthony_blocked]\n\n    # Function to check if a time is blocked by a participant\n    def is_blocked(start, end, participant):\n        # Convert start and end to minutes\n        start_min = start * 60\n        end_min = end * 60\n        # Check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n        for block_start, block_end in participant:\n            if (start_min < block_end and end_min > block_start):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible start times within work hours\n    for start_h in range(9, 17):\n        for start_m in range(0, 60):\n            start_min = start_h * 60 + start_m\n            end_min = start_min + duration\n            if end_min > 17 * 60:\n                continue  # End after work hours\n\n            # Check if this time slot is free for everyone\n            if not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, lisa_blocked) and \\\n               not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, anthony_blocked):\n                print(f\"{start_h:02}:{start_m:02}-{start_h:02}:{end_min//60:02}\")\n                print(\"Monday\")\n                return\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No available slot found\")\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
