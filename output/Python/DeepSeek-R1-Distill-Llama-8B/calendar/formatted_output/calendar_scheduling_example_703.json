            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, we need to find a time to meet Stephanie and Betty for one hour between 9 AM to 5 PM on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. There are some constraints to consider, like Stephanie avoiding meetings on Monday and Betty not meeting on Tuesday after 12:30 PM.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the blocked times for both Stephanie and Betty. For Stephanie, on Monday, she has meetings from 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, and 14:00 to 14:30. On Tuesday, she has a meeting from 12:00 to 13:00, and on Wednesday, from 9:00 to 10:00 and 13:00 to 14:00.\n\nBetty's schedule is a bit more complex. On Monday, she's busy from 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 16:00. On Tuesday, she has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, and 15:30 to 16:00. On Wednesday, her meetings are from 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 17:00.\n\nStephanie prefers not to meet on Monday, so we'll have to look at Tuesday or Wednesday. But Betty can't meet on Tuesday after 12:30 PM, so we need to find a time on Tuesday before 12:30 PM or on Wednesday.\n\nLet's start by checking Tuesday. On Tuesday, Stephanie is free from 13:00 to 14:00. Betty is free from 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, and 12:00 to 12:30. However, since Betty can't meet after 12:30 PM, the latest we can start on Tuesday is 12:30 PM. But Stephanie is only free until 14:00, so we can consider times from 13:00 to 14:00.\n\nLooking at Betty's availability on Tuesday, she is free from 12:00 to 12:30. But since she can't meet after 12:30 PM, the latest start time on Tuesday would be 12:30 PM, but that would end at 13:30 PM, which is within Stephanie's free time. However, we need to ensure that the entire duration fits within their free slots.\n\nIf we choose 12:30 PM to 13:30 PM on Tuesday, let's check if both are available. Stephanie is free from 13:00 to 14:00, so that fits. Betty is free from 12:00 to 12:30 and 12:30 to 13:00, but she can't meet after 12:30 PM. Therefore, the meeting can start at 12:30 PM and end at 13:30 PM.\n\nAlternatively, we could look at Wednesday. On Wednesday, Stephanie is free from 10:00 to 11:00 and 14:00 to 15:00. Betty is free from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:00 to 11:30, 11:30 to 12:00, and 12:00 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 17:00. However, we need to find a time that fits within the meeting duration of one hour.\n\nLooking at Wednesday, we can consider starting at 10:00 AM, ending at 11:00 AM, or starting at 14:00 PM, ending at 15:00 PM. Both of these times are within both participants' free slots.\n\nGiven that Stephanie prefers not to meet on Monday, and we found a suitable time on Tuesday and Wednesday, the earliest available time is on Tuesday at 12:30 PM. However, since Betty can't meet after 12:30 PM, the latest we can start is 12:30 PM, but the meeting would end at 13:30 PM, which is within both participants' free slots.\n\nTherefore, the best time to schedule the meeting is on Tuesday from 12:30 PM to 13:30 PM.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    work_hours = [(9, 17)]  # Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday\n    # Meeting duration\n    duration = 1  # 1 hour\n    \n    # Blocked times for each person\n    blocked_times = {\n        'Stephanie': {\n            'Monday': [(9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60), (10 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60), (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60), (14 * 60, 14 * 60 + 30)],\n            'Tuesday': [(12 * 60, 13 * 60)],\n            'Wednesday': [(9 * 60, 10 * 60), (13 * 60, 14 * 60)]\n        },\n        'Betty': {\n            'Monday': [(9 * 60, 10 * 60), (11 * 60, 11 * 60 + 30), (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60), (15 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60)],\n            'Tuesday': [(9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30), (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60), (12 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60 + 30), (15 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60)],\n            'Wednesday': [(10 * 60, 11 * 60 + 30), (12 * 60, 14 * 60), (14 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)]\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Function to check availability\n    def is_available(start, end, person):\n        for block_start, block_end in blocked_times[person].values():\n            if block_start <= start < block_end:\n                return False\n        return True\n    \n    # Check each possible start time\n    for day in ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']:\n        day_num = {'Monday': 0, 'Tuesday': 1, 'Wednesday': 2}[day]\n        start_time = 9 * 60\n        end_time = 17 * 60\n        \n        # Create a list of all time slots for the day\n        time_slots = []\n        for hour in range(9, 17):\n            for minute in range(0, 60):\n                time_slots.append((hour * 60 + minute, hour * 60 + minute + duration))\n        \n        # Filter time slots based on blocked times\n        available_slots = []\n        for slot in time_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            # Check if the time slot is within working hours\n            if not (9 * 60 <= time_start < 17 * 60 and 9 * 60 <= time_end < 17 * 60):\n                continue\n            # Check if the slot is available for both participants\n            if is_available(time_start, time_end, 'Stephanie') and is_available(time_start, time_end, 'Betty'):\n                available_slots.append(slot)\n        \n        # Find the first available slot that works for both participants\n        for slot in available_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            print(f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d}:{time_end % 60:02d} {day}\")\n            return f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d} {day}\"\n    \n    # If no slot is found, return an error message\n    return \"No available time found.\"\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
