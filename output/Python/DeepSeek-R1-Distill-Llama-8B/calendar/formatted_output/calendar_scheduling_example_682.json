            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help Amanda and Nathan find a suitable meeting time. They can meet either on Monday or Tuesday, but there are some constraints to consider. Amanda doesn't want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00, and Nathan can't meet on Monday. \n\nFirst, I'll look at Amanda's schedule for Monday. She's busy from 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00. So, the only free time on Monday before her first meeting is from 10:30 to 11:00. But Nathan is busy on Monday, so that won't work.\n\nNext, I'll check Amanda's schedule for Tuesday. She's free from 9:00 to 9:30 and from 10:30 to 11:00. But Amanda doesn't want to meet after 11:00 on Tuesday. So the latest they can meet on Tuesday is 11:00 to 11:30.\n\nNow, looking at Nathan's schedule for Tuesday. He's free from 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 16:00 to 16:30. The overlapping free time with Amanda's Tuesday availability is from 11:00 to 13:00.\n\nCombining both schedules, the best time to meet is from 11:00 to 11:30 on Tuesday. This fits within Amanda's constraint of not meeting after 11:00 on Tuesday and aligns with Nathan's availability.\n</think>\n\n```python\n'''python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Convert start time to datetime.time object\n    start_time = datetime.time(9)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17)\n\n    # Define each person's busy intervals\n    amanda_busy = [\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (10, 0), (10, 30),\n        (11, 0), (11, 30), (12, 30), (13, 0),\n        (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30), (15, 0),\n        (15, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30), (17, 0)\n    ]\n    nathan_busy = [\n        (10, 0), (10, 30), (11, 0), (11, 30),\n        (13, 30), (14, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30),\n        (9, 0), (9, 30), (10, 0), (10, 30),\n        (11, 0), (11, 30), (12, 0), (12, 30),\n        (13, 0), (13, 30), (14, 0), (14, 30),\n        (15, 0), (15, 30), (16, 0), (16, 30),\n        (17, 0), (17, 30)\n    ]\n\n    # Convert busy intervals to time ranges\n    def convert_intervals(intervals):\n        all_time = set()\n        for h, m in intervals:\n            start = datetime.time(h, m)\n            end = start + datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)\n            all_time.add(start)\n            all_time.add(end)\n        return all_time\n\n    amanda_busy = convert_intervals(amanda_busy)\n    nathan_busy = convert_intervals(nathan_busy)\n\n    # Check each day from Monday to Tuesday\n    for day in [datetime.weekday(), datetime.weekday() + 1]:  # Monday (0), Tuesday (1)\n        current_day = datetime.date.fromisoformat('2023-10-09') + datetime.timedelta(days=day)\n        start_day = current_day.replace(hour=9, minute=0)\n        end_day = current_day.replace(hour=17, minute=0)\n\n        # Check each minute from start_time to end_time - duration\n        for minute in range(start_day.hour * 60, end_day.hour * 60 + 1):\n            current = datetime.time(minute // 60, minute % 60)\n            end = current + datetime.timedelta(minutes=duration)\n            end_time = end.time()\n\n            # Check if current minute is free for both\n            if (current not in amanda_busy and\n                current not in nathan_busy):\n                # Check if the entire duration fits in the day\n                if end_time <= datetime.time(17, 0):\n                    return f\"{current.hour:02d}:{current.minute:02d} to {end.hour:02d}:{end.minute:02d} on {current_day.weekday():02d} days\"\n\n    # If no slot found (shouldn't happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No suitable time found\"\n\n# Get the result\nresult = find_meeting_time()\nprint(f\"{result}\")\n'''",
