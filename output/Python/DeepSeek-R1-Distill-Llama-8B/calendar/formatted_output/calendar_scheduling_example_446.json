            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to figure out a time to schedule a meeting for all these people: Megan, Christine, Gabriel, Sara, Bruce, Kathryn, and Billy. The meeting should be half an hour long between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's busy times and figure out their free slots. Then, I'll look for a time where all of them have a slot that doesn't overlap and is at least 30 minutes long.\n\nStarting with Megan. She's busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30. So her free times are 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:00-14:00, and 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. Wait, no, actually, the meeting is on Monday, so I need to check if she's free during the day. Let me correct that.\n\nMegan's schedule on Monday:\n- 9:00-9:30: busy\n- 9:30-10:00: free\n- 10:00-11:00: busy\n- 11:00-11:30: free\n- 11:30-12:00: busy (Christine's schedule says she's busy from 11:30-12:00)\n- 12:00-12:30: busy\n- 12:30-13:00: free\n- 13:00-14:00: busy (Christine is busy from 13:00-14:00)\n- 14:00-14:30: free\n- 14:30-15:00: busy (Sara is busy here)\n- 15:00-15:30: free\n- 15:30-16:00: busy (Billy is busy from 15:30-16:00)\n- 16:00-16:30: free\n- 16:30-17:00: free\n\nWait, but the meeting needs to be between 9:00 and 17:00, so the latest it can start is 16:30 to end at 17:00.\n\nNext, Christine's schedule:\n- 9:00-9:30: busy\n- 9:30-11:30: free\n- 11:30-12:00: busy\n- 12:00-13:00: free\n- 13:00-14:00: busy\n- 14:00-15:30: free\n- 15:30-16:30: busy\n- 16:30-17:00: free\n\nGabriel is free the entire day, so any time works for him.\n\nSara's meetings:\n- 11:30-12:00: busy\n- 14:30-15:00: busy\n\nBruce's schedule:\n- 9:30-10:00: busy\n- 10:00-12:00: busy\n- 12:30-14:00: busy\n- 14:30-15:00: busy\n- 15:30-16:30: busy\n- 16:30-17:00: free\n\nKathryn is busy from 10:00-15:30 and 16:00-16:30.\n\nBilly's meetings:\n- 9:00-9:30: busy\n- 11:00-11:30: busy\n- 12:00-14:00: busy\n- 14:30-15:30: busy\n- 15:30-16:00: busy (overlaps with Bruce)\n- 16:00-16:30: busy\n- 16:30-17:00: free\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute window where all of them are free.\n\nLet me list all possible time slots and check each.\n\nStarting from 9:30, Megan is free from 9:30-10:00. Let's see others:\n\n- Megan: 9:30-10:00 free\n- Christine: free 9:30-11:30, so yes\n- Gabriel: free\n- Sara: free before 11:30\n- Bruce: busy from 9:30-10:00\n- Kathryn: busy from 10:00-15:30, so no\n- Billy: busy from 9:00-9:30, then free 9:30-10:00 (since he's busy from 9:00-9:30, but after that, 9:30-10:00 is free? Wait, his schedule says 9:00-9:30 busy, so 9:30-10:00 is free. So Billy is free from 9:30-10:00.\n\nWait, but Bruce is busy from 9:30-10:00, so the meeting can't be during that time because Bruce is busy.\n\nSo 9:30-10:00 is out because Bruce is busy.\n\nNext possible slot: 11:30-12:00.\n\nCheck each person:\n\n- Megan: 11:30-12:00 is busy (she's busy from 11:30-12:00)\n- Christine: busy from 11:30-12:00\n- Sara: busy from 11:30-12:00\n- So that slot is out.\n\nNext, 12:30-13:00.\n\nMegan is free here.\n\nChristine: free from 12:00-13:00, so yes.\n\nSara: free after 12:00, so yes.\n\nBruce: busy from 12:30-14:00.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is when Bruce is busy, so can't use that.\n\nNext slot: 13:00-14:00.\n\nChristine is busy here.\n\nSo no.\n\nNext, 14:00-14:30.\n\nMegan is free here.\n\nChristine is free from 14:00-15:30.\n\nSara is busy from 14:30-15:00.\n\nSo 14:00-14:30: check others.\n\nGabriel: free.\n\nBruce: busy from 12:30-14:00, so 14:00 is the end of his busy time, so free from 14:00 onwards? Wait, his schedule is 12:30-14:00, so 14:00 is free.\n\nKathryn: busy until 15:30, so 14:00-15:30 is busy.\n\nBilly: busy from 12:00-14:00, so 14:00 is free.\n\nSo, 14:00-14:30: Megan, Christine, Sara (free after 14:00?), wait no, Sara is busy from 14:30-15:00, so 14:00-14:30 is free for her.\n\nWait, Sara is busy from 14:30-15:00, so 14:00-14:30 is free.\n\nBut Kathryn is busy from 14:00-15:30, so 14:00-14:30 is during her busy time.\n\nSo that slot is out because Kathryn is busy.\n\nNext slot: 14:30-15:00.\n\nSara is busy here.\n\nSo no.\n\nNext, 15:00-15:30.\n\nMegan is free here.\n\nChristine is free from 15:30 onwards, so 15:00-15:30 is free for her.\n\nSara is busy until 15:00, so 15:00 is the end of her busy time, so free from 15:00 onwards.\n\nWait, Sara's meetings end at 15:00, so she's free from 15:00 onwards.\n\nSo 15:00-15:30: check others.\n\nGabriel: free.\n\nBruce: busy from 15:30-16:30, so 15:00-15:30 is free.\n\nKathryn: busy until 15:30, so 15:00-15:30 is during her busy time.\n\nBilly: busy until 15:30, so 15:00-15:30 is during his busy time.\n\nSo that slot is out because Kathryn and Billy are busy.\n\nNext, 15:30-16:00.\n\nCheck each person:\n\nMegan: free from 15:30-16:00.\n\nChristine: busy until 16:30, so 15:30-16:00 is during her busy time.\n\nSo no.\n\nNext, 16:00-16:30.\n\nMegan is free here.\n\nChristine is busy until 16:30, so 16:00-16:30 is during her busy time.\n\nSo no.\n\nFinally, 16:30-17:00.\n\nMegan is free here.\n\nChristine is free from 16:30-17:00.\n\nGabriel: free.\n\nSara: free.\n\nBruce: free from 16:30 onwards.\n\nKathryn: busy until 16:30, so 16:30 is the end of her busy time, so free from 16:30 onwards.\n\nBilly: busy until 16:30, so 16:30 is free.\n\nSo, 16:30-17:00: everyone is free except Kathryn and Billy, who are busy until 16:30, so they are free from 16:30 onwards.\n\nWait, no, Kathryn is busy from 16:00-16:30, so 16:30 is free.\n\nBilly is busy from 16:00-16:30, so 16:30 is free.\n\nSo the meeting can be scheduled at 16:30-17:00.\n\nBut wait, the duration is 30 minutes, so starting at 16:30 would end at 17:00, which is within the 9:00-17:00 window.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Megan: 16:30-17:00 is free.\n- Christine: 16:30-17:00 is free.\n- Gabriel: free.\n- Sara: free.\n- Bruce: free.\n- Kathryn: free from 16:30 onwards.\n- Billy: free from 16:30 onwards.\n\nYes, everyone is free during 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo the meeting can be scheduled at 16:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(schedules,
