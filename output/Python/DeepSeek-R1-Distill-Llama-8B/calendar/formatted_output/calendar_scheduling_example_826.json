Cheryl's calendar is completely open, which is good, but James has a lot of meetings throughout the week. The goal is to find the earliest available time for a half-hour meeting between 9 AM and 5 PM on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.\n\nFirst, I should look at James's schedule and see when he has the most availability. Since Cheryl is free all week, the meeting can be on any day, but I need to make sure it doesn't conflict with James's meetings.\n\nLet me start by checking each day one by one, from Monday to Thursday, and see if there's a slot where James isn't busy. I'll go day by day and look for the earliest possible time.\n\nOn Monday, James has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30, then from 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:30, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, the free times on Monday would be between 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, and 15:30 to 16:30. The earliest slot here is 11:00.\n\nOn Tuesday, James has meetings from 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00. So, the free times are from 12:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00, and 17:00 onwards, but 17:00 is the end of the working day. The earliest available slot on Tuesday is 12:00.\n\nOn Wednesday, James has meetings from 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 16:00. So, the free times are from 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, and 16:00 onwards. The earliest slot on Wednesday is 11:00.\n\nOn Thursday, James has meetings from 9:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, the free times are from 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 16:00. The earliest slot on Thursday is 11:30.\n\nNow, comparing the earliest slots across all days, Monday at 11:00 is the earliest possible time where both Cheryl and James are available. Therefore, the meeting should be scheduled for Monday at 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    work_hours = [(9, 17), (9, 17), (9, 17), (9, 17)]  # Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday\n    # Meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n    \n    # Blocked times for James\n    blocked_times = {\n        'Monday': [(9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30), (10 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60), (12 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60), \n                  (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60 + 30), (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)],\n        'Tuesday': [(9 * 60, 11 * 60), (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60), (12 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60 + 30), \n                  (16 * 60, 17 * 60)],\n        'Wednesday': [(10 * 60, 11 * 60), (12 * 60, 13 * 60), (13 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60)],\n        'Thursday': [(9 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60 + 30), (12 * 60, 12 * 60 + 30), (13 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60 + 60), \n                  (14 * 60, 14 * 60 + 30), (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)]\n    }\n    \n    # Function to check availability\n    def is_available(start, end):\n        return not any(block_start <= start < block_end for block_start, block_end in blocked_times.get(day, []))\n    \n    # Check each day for possible meeting times\n    for day in ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday']:\n        day_num = {'Monday': 0, 'Tuesday': 1, 'Wednesday': 2, 'Thursday': 3}[day]\n        start_time = 9 * 60\n        end_time = 17 * 60\n        \n        # Create a list of all time slots for the day\n        time_slots = []\n        for hour in range(9, 17):\n            for minute in range(0, 60):\n                time_slots.append((hour * 60 + minute, hour * 60 + minute + duration))\n        \n        # Filter time slots based on blocked times\n        available_slots = []\n        for slot in time_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            if 9 * 60 <= time_start < 17 * 60 and 9 * 60 <= time_end < 17 * 60:\n                if is_available(time_start, time_end):\n                    available_slots.append(slot)\n        \n        # Find the first available slot that works for both participants\n        for slot in available_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            print(f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d}:{time_end % 60:02d} {day}\")\n            return f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d} {day}\"\n    \n    # If no slot is found, return an error message\n    return \"No available time found.\"\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
