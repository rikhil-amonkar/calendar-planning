            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Christine, Janice, Bobby, Elizabeth, Tyler, and Edward. The meeting should be half an hour long and take place on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Janice prefers not meeting after 13:00, so I need to keep that in mind.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each person's schedule to see when they're available. Christine is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30. That leaves gaps in the morning, between 10:30 to 12:00, and from 13:30 to 14:30.\n\nJanice has no meetings, so she's available the entire day. Bobby is busy from 12:00 to 12:30 and 14:30 to 15:00. Elizabeth is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. So she's free from 9:30 to 11:30, 14:00 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 16:00. Tyler is busy from 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. That leaves him free from 11:00 to 12:00, 13:30 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30. Edward is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. So his free times are from 11:00 to 11:30, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:30 to 16:00.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that works for everyone. Since Janice doesn't want to meet after 13:00, I should focus on times before that. Looking at Christine's free slots, she's available from 10:30 to 12:00 and 13:30 to 14:30. Bobby is busy from 12:00 to 12:30 and 14:30 to 15:00, so he's free from 12:30 to 14:30. Elizabeth is free from 14:00 to 15:00. Tyler is free from 13:30 to 15:00. Edward is free from 14:00 to 14:30.\n\nCombining these, the latest time before 13:00 is 12:00 to 12:30. But Bobby is busy then. The next available slot is from 13:30 to 14:30. Checking everyone's availability:\n\n- Christine is free from 13:30 to 14:30.\n- Bobby is free from 12:30 to 14:30.\n- Elizabeth is free from 14:00 to 15:00.\n- Tyler is free from 13:30 to 15:00.\n- Edward is free from 14:00 to 14:30.\n\nSo the overlapping free time is from 14:00 to 14:30. That seems to work for everyone. So the meeting can be scheduled from 14:00 to 14:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days):\n    # Convert schedules to time objects for easier manipulation\n    free_times = []\n    for person in participants:\n        free = []\n        for time in person:\n            start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n            end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n            free.append((start, end))\n        free_times.append(free)\n    \n    # Check each preferred day\n    for day in preferred_days:\n        day_free = True\n        for person in participants:\n            for time in person:\n                if time[0].date() == day.date():\n                    start = time[0]\n                    end = time[1]\n                    if not (end < start + meeting_duration):\n                        day_free = False\n                        break\n            if not day_free:\n                break\n        if day_free:\n            for time in participants[0]:\n                start = time[0]\n                end = time[1]\n                if start.date() == day.date() and end.date() == day.date():\n                    return f\"{start.strftime('%H:%M')}:{end.strftime('%H:%M')}: {day}\"\n    \n    # If no time found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No time found\"\n\n# Example usage\nparticipants = [\n    [\n        (\"09:30\", \"10:30\"),\n        (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"15:00\"),\n        (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"17:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"15:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n        (\"11:30\", \"13:00\"),\n        (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"),\n        (\"15:00\", \"15:30\"),\n        (\"16:00\", \"17:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"11:00\"),\n        (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"16:00\"),\n        (\"16:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n        (\"10:00\", \"11:00\"),\n        (\"11:30\", \"14:00\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"15:30\"),\n        (\"16:00\", \"17:00\")\n    ]\n]\n\nmeeting_duration = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\npreferred_days = [\"Monday\"]\n\nprint(find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days))\n```",
