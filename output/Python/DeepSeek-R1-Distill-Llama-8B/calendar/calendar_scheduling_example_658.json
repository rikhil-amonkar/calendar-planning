Let me look at their schedules to find a suitable time.\n\nFirst, I'll check Shirley's blocks. On Monday, she's busy from 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, and 16:00 to 16:30. On Tuesday, she's blocked from 9:30 to 10:00. So, Shirley is free on Monday before 10:30, after 12:30 until 16:00, and on Tuesday before 9:30 and after 16:30.\n\nNow, looking at Albert's schedule. On Monday, he's fully booked from 9:00 to 17:00. That means he's busy all day Monday. On Tuesday, he's busy from 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, Albert is free on Tuesday between 12:30 to 13:00 and 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nSince Shirley doesn't want to meet on Tuesday after 10:30, I need to find a time that works for both on Monday or Tuesday before 10:30 or after 16:30.\n\nOn Monday, Shirley is free from 9:00 to 10:30, 12:30 to 16:00. Albert is fully booked on Monday, so there's no conflict there. But since Albert is busy all day Monday, we can't meet on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Shirley is free before 9:30 and after 16:30. Albert is free on Tuesday between 12:30 to 13:00 and 16:00 to 16:30. So, the overlapping free times are after 16:30 on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the earliest available time is 16:30 to 17:00 on Tuesday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nparticipants = [\n    {'name': 'Shirley', 'blocks': [(330, 360), (420, 450), (960, 990)]},  # Monday: 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 16:00-16:30; Tuesday: 9:30-10:00\n    {'name': 'Albert', 'blocks': [(270, 300), (540, 570), (630, 660), (780, 780), (840, 870), (900, 930), (960, 990), (990, 1020)]}  # Monday: 9:00-17:00; Tuesday: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n]\n\nday_options = ['Monday', 'Tuesday']\n\nfor day in day_options:\n    if day == 'Monday':\n        start_times = [900, 1050, 1170, 1260, 1380, 1500, 1710]\n    elif day == 'Tuesday':\n        start_times = [540, 630, 690, 780, 870, 960, 1050]\n    \n    for start in start_times:\n        slot = (start, start + 30)\n        conflict = False\n        for participant in participants:\n            for block in participant['blocks']:\n                if not (block[1] < slot[0] or block[0] > slot[1]):\n                    conflict = True\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                break\n        if not conflict:\n            print(f\"{start//30:02d}:{start%30:02d}-{(start+30)//30:02d}:{(start+30)%30:02d} Tuesday\")\n            exit()\n```",
