            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to figure out how to schedule a meeting between Ryan and Adam given their busy schedules and constraints. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the existing schedules for both Ryan and Adam. Ryan is busy on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, but not on any other days. Adam's schedule is also quite packed, especially on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe meeting needs to be 30 minutes long and can be scheduled on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. But Ryan can't meet on Wednesday, so the possible days are Monday or Tuesday.\n\nNext, I should consider the constraints. Adam wants to avoid meetings before 14:30 on Monday. So on Monday, the latest we can start the meeting is at 14:30. Since the meeting is 30 minutes, it would end at 15:00. Let me check if that time is available for both.\n\nLooking at Ryan's schedule on Monday: he has a meeting from 15:30 to 16:00. So 14:30 to 15:00 is free. On the same day, Adam's schedule has a break from 13:30 to 14:00 and another from 16:00 to 16:30. So starting at 14:30 would work for Adam as well.\n\nWait, but Adam's schedule on Monday also shows a meeting from 14:00 to 16:00. That means from 14:00 to 16:00 is busy. So the latest we can start on Monday is 14:30, which is the end of Adam's 14:00 to 16:00 meeting. So 14:30 to 15:00 is available.\n\nLet me check if there's a time earlier on Tuesday. Ryan is free on Tuesday from 11:30 to 12:30 and again from 15:30 to 16:00. Adam on Tuesday has a meeting from 10:30 to 15:30. So the latest available time on Tuesday is 15:30, but Ryan is also free from 15:30 to 16:00. So 15:30 to 16:00 is a possible slot, but that's only 30 minutes. However, the meeting needs to be 30 minutes, so starting at 15:30 would end at 16:00, which might be acceptable.\n\nBut the user mentioned that Adam prefers avoiding meetings before 14:30 on Monday, so Monday at 14:30 seems better because it's later and might be more convenient for both. Plus, Tuesday's slot is also possible, but maybe Monday is preferred.\n\nSo the possible times are:\n- Monday 14:30-15:00\n- Tuesday 15:30-16:00\n\nI need to choose the earliest possible time or the one that fits both. Since both are available, maybe Monday is better as per the user's example solution.\n\nWait, in the example solution, the meeting was scheduled on Tuesday at 15:30. Let me see why.\n\nLooking back, in the example, the solution was to choose Tuesday 15:30. So perhaps the assistant concluded that Tuesday is better because it's after 14:30 and fits both schedules.\n\nWait, let me recheck the schedules.\n\nRyan's Tuesday schedule: free from 11:30-12:30 and 15:30-16:00.\n\nAdam's Tuesday schedule: busy from 10:30-15:30, so free from 15:30 onwards.\n\nSo 15:30-16:00 is available for both. That's a 30-minute window.\n\nOn Monday, the latest available is 14:30-15:00, which is also 30 minutes.\n\nSo both options are possible. The user might prefer Monday because it's earlier in the week, but the example solution chose Tuesday. Maybe because on Monday, Adam's 14:00-16:00 is a longer block, and 14:30 is the earliest available after that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant prefers to choose the latest possible time to maximize the day's remaining time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant found that Tuesday's slot is earlier and fits better. Wait, no, 15:30 is later than 14:30. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant considered that both have more availability on Tuesday. Let me check.\n\nOn Monday, Ryan is busy from 9:30-10:00, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo the free slots are 10:00-11:00, 12:00-13:00, and 14:00-15:30.\n\nBut Adam is busy from 14:00-16:00 on Monday, so the only available slot for Ryan is before 14:00 and after 16:00, but after 16:00 is 16:30-17:00, which is too late for a 30-minute meeting starting at 16:30.\n\nWait, no, the meeting needs to be 30 minutes, so starting at 16:30 would end at 17:00. That's possible, but Adam is busy until 17:00. So Adam is free from 16:30 onwards? Wait, no, Adam's Monday schedule says he's busy until 17:00. So starting at 16:30 would end at 17:00, but Adam is busy until 17:00. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, let me recheck Adam's schedule on Monday: 9:00-10:30, 11:00-13:30, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So he's busy until 17:00. So the only available time on Monday is before 14:00 and after 16:00 but before 17:00. But Ryan is free from 14:00-15:30. However, Adam is busy from 14:00-16:00, so the latest they can meet on Monday is 16:30-17:00, but Adam is busy until 17:00, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, no, the meeting needs to be 30 minutes. So starting at 16:30 would end at 17:00, but Adam is busy until 17:00, so that's not possible. So the only available time on Monday is 14:30-15:00, but Adam is busy until 16:00, so that's okay because 14:30-15:00 is before his 14:00-16:00 meeting. Wait, no, 14:30 is after 14:00, so he's busy until 16:00. So 14:30-15:00 is within his busy time. That's a problem.\n\nWait, no, if the meeting starts at 14:30, it would end at 15:00, which is within Adam's 14:00-16:00 meeting. So that's not possible. So the only available time on Monday is before 14:00.\n\nRyan is free from 12:00-13:00 on Monday. So maybe 12:00-13:00. But Adam is busy from 11:00-13:30 on Monday, so he's busy until 13:30. So 12:00-13:00 is within his busy time. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, so on Monday, the only available time is after 16:00, but that's too late because Adam is busy until 17:00, and the meeting would have to end by 17:00, which is possible, but Ryan is free from 15:30-16:00 and 16:30-17:00. So if they start at 16:30, they end at 17:00, but Adam is busy until 17:00. So that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, on Monday, there's no available time that works for both.\n\nSo the only possible day is Tuesday. On Tuesday, Ryan is free from 11:30-12:30 and 15:30-16:00.\n\nAdam on Tuesday is busy from 10:30-15:30, so free from 15:30 onwards.\n\nSo the latest they can meet on Tuesday is 15:30-16:00. That works for both.\n\nSo the meeting should be scheduled on Tuesday at 15:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(ryan_schedule, adam_schedule, meeting_duration, preferred_days):\n    # Convert schedules to time objects for easier manipulation\n    ryan_free = set()\n    for time in ryan_schedule:\n        start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n        end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n        ryan_free.add((start, end))\n    \n    adam_free = set()\n    for time in adam_schedule:\n        start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n        end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n        adam_free.add((start, end))\n    \n    # Check each preferred day\n    for day in preferred_days:\n        current_day = datetime.date.weekday(day)\n        # Get the available time slots for the day\n        day_free = []\n        for time in ryan_free:\n            if time[0].date() == day and not any(adam_time[0].date() == day for adam_time in adam_free):\n                day_free.append(time)\n        \n        # Find overlapping time slots\n        for slot in day_free:\n            start = slot[0]\n            end = slot[1] + datetime.timedelta(minutes=meeting_duration)\n            if start.time() >= end.time():\n                continue\n            if all(not (adam_start.date() == day and start <= adam_start < end for adam_start, adam_end in adam_free)):\n                return f\"{start.strftime('%H:%M')}:{end.strftime('%H:%M')}: {day}\"\n    \n    # If no time found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No time found\"\n\n# Example usage\npreferred_days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\nmeeting_duration = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\n\nryan_schedule = [\n    (\"09:30\", \"10:00\"),\n    (\"11:00\", \"12:00\"),\n    (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"),\n    (\"15:30\", \"16:00\"),\n    (\"16:30\", \"17:00\"),\n    (\"11:30\", \"12:30\"),\n    (\"15:30\", \"16:00\"),\n    (\"16:30\", \"17:00\"),\n    (\"12:00\", \"13:00\"),\n    (\"15:30\", \"16:00\")\n]\n\nadam_schedule = [\n    (\"09:00\", \"10:30\"),\n    (\"11:00\", \"13:30\"),\n    (\"14:00\", \"16:00\"),\n    (\"16:30\", \"17:00\"),\n    (\"09:00\", \"10:00\"),\n    (\"10:30\", \"15:30\"),\n    (\"16:00\", \"17:00\"),\n    (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n    (\"10:00\", \"11:00\"),\n    (\"11:30\", \"14:30\"),\n    (\"15:00\", \"15:30\"),\n    (\"16:00\", \"16:30\")\n]\n\nprint(find_meeting_time(ryan_schedule, adam_schedule, meeting_duration, preferred_days))\n```",
