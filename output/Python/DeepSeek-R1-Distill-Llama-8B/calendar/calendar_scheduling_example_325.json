The meeting should be half an hour long and can be on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Jose doesn't want to meet after 15:30 on Monday, so the latest we can start is 15:30. Let me look at everyone's schedules to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's busy times:\n\n- **Jose**: \n  - 11:00 to 11:30\n  - 12:30 to 13:00\n\n- **Keith**:\n  - 14:00 to 14:30\n  - 15:00 to 15:30\n\n- **Logan**:\n  - 9:00 to 10:00\n  - 12:00 to 12:30\n  - 15:00 to 15:30\n\n- **Megan**:\n  - 9:00 to 10:30\n  - 11:00 to 12:00\n  - 13:00 to 13:30\n  - 14:30 to 16:30\n\n- **Gary**:\n  - 9:00 to 9:30\n  - 10:00 to 10:30\n  - 11:30 to 13:00\n  - 13:30 to 14:00\n  - 14:30 to 16:30\n\n- **Bobby**:\n  - 11:00 to 11:30\n  - 12:00 to 12:30\n  - 13:00 to 16:00\n\nJose's constraint is the most restrictive because he doesn't want to meet after 15:30. So, the latest we can start the meeting is at 15:30. Let's check if 15:30 to 16:00 works.\n\nLooking at Jose's schedule, he's busy until 13:00, so 15:30 is after his last meeting. Keith is busy from 15:00 to 15:30, so he's free from 15:30 onwards. Logan is free from 15:00 to 17:00, so 15:30 is fine. Megan is busy until 16:30, so 15:30 to 16:00 is within her free time. Gary is also free from 15:30 onwards, and Bobby is free from 16:00 onwards.\n\nSo, 15:30 to 16:00 seems to be a good time that works for everyone. I'll write a Python script to check this.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days):\n    # Convert schedules to time objects for easier manipulation\n    free_times = []\n    for person in participants:\n        free = []\n        for time in person:\n            start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n            end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n            free.append((start, end))\n        free_times.append(free)\n    \n    # Check each preferred day\n    for day in preferred_days:\n        day_free = True\n        for person in participants:\n            for time in person:\n                if time[0].date() == day.date():\n                    start = time[0]\n                    end = time[1]\n                    if not (end < start + meeting_duration):\n                        day_free = False\n                        break\n            if not day_free:\n                break\n        if day_free:\n            for time in participants[0]:\n                start = time[0]\n                end = time[1]\n                if start.date() == day.date() and end.date() == day.date():\n                    return f\"{start.strftime('%H:%M')}:{end.strftime('%H:%M')}: {day}\"\n    \n    # If no time found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No time found\"\n\n# Example usage\nparticipants = [\n    [\n        (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"),\n        (\"12:30\", \"13:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"14:00\", \"14:30\"),\n        (\"15:00\", \"15:30\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"10:00\"),\n        (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n        (\"15:00\", \"15:30\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"10:30\"),\n        (\"11:00\", \"12:00\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"16:30\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n        (\"10:00\", \"10:30\"),\n        (\"11:30\", \"13:00\"),\n        (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"16:30\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"11:00\", \"11:30\"),\n        (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"16:00\")\n    ]\n]\n\nmeeting_duration = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\npreferred_days = [\"Monday\"]\n\nprint(find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days))\n```",
