            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to help schedule a meeting for Andrew, Grace, and Samuel on Monday. The meeting should last half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00. Let's see what each person's schedule looks like.\n\nFirst, Andrew is completely free the entire day. That's good because it gives us more flexibility. Grace also has no meetings, so she's fully available. Samuel, on the other hand, has several blocked periods: 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nSo, I need to find a time that doesn't overlap with any of Samuel's busy periods. Since the group wants the earliest availability, I should start checking from the earliest possible time after 9:00.\n\nLet's list out the busy times for Samuel:\n- 9:00-10:30\n- 11:30-12:00\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 14:00-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nThe gaps between these busy periods are:\n- 10:30-11:30\n- 12:00-13:00\n- 13:30-14:00\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nLooking at these gaps, the earliest slot after 9:00 that's free is 10:30-11:30. But I need to check if that works for everyone. Andrew and Grace are free, so that should be fine.\n\nWait, but the group prefers the earliest availability. Let me make sure there's no earlier slot that works. The first free slot after 9:00 is right after 10:30, so 10:30 seems to be the earliest.\n\nI should also consider the duration. The meeting is half an hour, so if we start at 10:30, we end at 11:00. That fits within the 10:30-11:30 gap. Let me double-check if any other person has a meeting during that time. Andrew and Grace are free, and Samuel's busy periods don't include 10:30-11:00.\n\nSo, 10:30 seems to be a good time. But wait, the group wants the earliest time. Is there an even earlier time that works? Let's see.\n\nAfter 9:00, the first free slot is 10:30. Before that, from 9:00-10:30, Samuel is busy. So 10:30 is the earliest they can all meet.\n\nI think that's the best option. Let me confirm by checking each person's schedule again. Andrew and Grace are fully free, so they don't have any conflicts. Samuel's schedule shows he's free from 10:30-11:00, so the meeting fits.\n\nTherefore, the meeting should be scheduled for 10:30 to 11:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(schedules, duration, day_of_week):\n    # Convert day of week to Monday\n    if day_of_week == 'Tuesday':\n        day = datetime.date.weekday(datetime.date.today()) + 1\n    else:\n        day = datetime.date.weekday(datetime.date.today())\n    \n    # Check if today is the correct day\n    if datetime.date.today().weekday() != day:\n        return \"No meeting possible on the specified day.\"\n    \n    # Define the work hours\n    start_time = datetime.time(9, 0)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17, 0)\n    \n    # Function to check if a time is within a busy period\n    def is_busy(person, time):\n        for period in person:\n            if period[0] <= time < period[1]:\n                return True\n        return False\n    \n    # Convert schedules to time ranges\n    all_busy = [person for person in schedules]\n    \n    # Check each day from earliest to latest\n    for day in day_of_week:\n        day = datetime.date.fromisoformat(day)\n        if day < datetime.date.today():\n            continue\n        \n        # Check each possible time slot\n        for hour in range(17, 9, -1):\n            for minute in range(0, 60):\n                start = datetime.time(hour, minute)\n                end = start + datetime.timedelta(hours=duration)\n                \n                # Check if the time is within work hours\n                if end > end_time:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Check if all are free\n                conflict = False\n                for person in all_busy:\n                    if is_busy(person, start):\n                        conflict = True\n                        break\n                if conflict:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Return the earliest possible time\n                return f\"{hour:02}:{minute:02}:{end.hour:02}:{end.minute:02} {day.weekday():strftime('%A', day)}\"\n    \n    return \"No meeting possible within the given constraints.\"\n\n# Example usage:\n# schedules = {\n#     \"Andrew\": [],\n#     \"Grace\": [],\n#     \"Samuel\": [\n#         (datetime.time(9, 0), datetime.time(10, 30)),\n#         (datetime.time(11, 30), datetime.time(12, 0)),\n#         (datetime.time(13, 0), datetime.time(13, 30)),\n#         (datetime.time(14, 0), datetime.time(16, 0)),\n#         (datetime.time(16, 30), datetime.time(17, 0))\n#     ]\n# }\n# print(find_meeting_time(schedules, datetime.timedelta(hours=0.5), [\"Monday\"]))\n```",
