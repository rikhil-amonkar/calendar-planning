Let me start by looking at their schedules.\n\nFirst, I'll check Arthur's schedule. He has meetings on Monday from 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00, and 15:00 to 15:30. On Tuesday, he's busy from 13:00 to 13:30 and 16:00 to 16:30. On Wednesday, he has meetings from 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, and 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nNext, Michael's schedule is a bit more extensive. On Monday, he's busy from 9:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 17:00. On Tuesday, he has meetings from 9:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:30, and 14:00 to 15:30. On Wednesday, he's busy from 10:00 to 12:30 and 13:00 to 13:30.\n\nArthur can't meet on Tuesday, so I'll focus on Monday and Wednesday. I'll start by checking the earliest available time on Monday. Let's look at the time slots from 9:00 onwards.\n\nBetween 9:00 and 11:00, Arthur is free, but Michael is busy until 12:00. So, the first possible slot might be right after Michael's meeting. After Michael's 12:00 to 13:00 block, the next available time is 13:00. Let's see if Arthur is free at 13:00. Arthur has a meeting from 13:30 to 14:00, so 13:00 to 13:30 seems available. That's a half-hour slot, which fits the meeting duration.\n\nI should check if this time works for both. Michael is free from 13:00 to 13:30, and Arthur is also free during that time. Perfect! So, the meeting can be scheduled at 13:00 to 13:30 on Monday.\n\nI should also consider Wednesday, but since they can meet earlier on Monday, it's better to choose Monday. This way, they can have the earliest possible time without waiting until Wednesday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nparticipants = [\n    {'name': 'Arthur', 'blocks': [(330, 360), (690, 720), (780, 780), (840, 870), (900, 930)]},  # Monday: 11:00-11:30, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30; Tuesday: 13:00-13:30, 16:00-16:30; Wednesday: 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 14:00-14:30, 16:00-16:30\n    {'name': 'Michael', 'blocks': [(270, 300), (540, 600), (630, 660), (780, 780), (840, 870), (900, 930), (960, 990), (1020, 1050)]}  # Monday: 9:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-17:00; Tuesday: 9:30-11:30, 12:00-13:30, 14:00-15:30; Wednesday: 10:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30\n]\n\nday_options = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']\n\nfor day in day_options:\n    if day == 'Monday':\n        start_times = [900, 1050, 1170, 1260, 1380, 1500, 1710]\n    elif day == 'Tuesday':\n        start_times = [540, 630, 690, 780, 870, 960, 1050]\n    elif day == 'Wednesday':\n        start_times = [900, 1050, 1170, 1260, 1380, 1500, 1710]\n    \n    for start in start_times:\n        slot = (start, start + 30)\n        conflict = False\n        for participant in participants:\n            for block in participant['blocks']:\n                if not (block[1] < slot[0] or block[0] > slot[1]):\n                    conflict = True\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                break\n        if not conflict:\n            print(f\"{start//30:02d}:{start%30:02d}-{(start+30)//30:02d}:{(start+30)%30:02d} Monday\")\n            exit()\n```",
