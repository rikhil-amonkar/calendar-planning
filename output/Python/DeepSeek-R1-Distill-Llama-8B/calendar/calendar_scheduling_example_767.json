The meeting can be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, but it has to fit within their work hours of 9:00 to 17:00. I also need to consider their blocked times and any preferences they have.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Martha's schedule. She's busy on Monday from 16:00 to 17:00, which is the end of the workday. On Tuesday, she has a block from 15:00 to 15:30. On Wednesday, she's busy from 10:00 to 11:00 and again from 14:00 to 14:30.\n\nNext, Beverly's schedule is more extensive. On Monday, she's blocked from 9:00 to 13:30 and from 14:00 to 17:00. That leaves a small window between 13:30 to 14:00. On Tuesday, she's fully booked from 9:00 to 17:00, so no availability there. On Wednesday, she's busy from 9:30 to 15:30 and from 16:30 to 17:00, leaving a gap from 15:30 to 16:30.\n\nI need to find a time that works for both of them. Let's check each day:\n\n- **Monday**: Martha is free before 16:00, but Beverly is busy until 13:30 and again from 14:00. The only small window is from 13:30 to 14:00. However, that's only 30 minutes, and the meeting needs to be an hour. So Monday isn't possible.\n\n- **Tuesday**: Beverly is fully booked, so no availability.\n\n- **Wednesday**: Martha is free from 11:00 to 14:00 and 14:30 to 16:00. Beverly is free from 15:30 to 16:30. The overlapping time is from 15:30 to 16:30. That fits the meeting duration of one hour.\n\nSo the best time is Wednesday from 15:30 to 16:30.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    work_hours = [(9, 17), (9, 17), (9, 17)]  # Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday\n    # Meeting duration\n    duration = 1\n    \n    # Available days based on the participants' constraints\n    available_days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']\n    \n    # Check each day for possible meeting times\n    for day in available_days:\n        # Convert day to numerical value for easier comparison\n        day_num = {'Monday': 0, 'Tuesday': 1, 'Wednesday': 2}[day]\n        start_time = 9 * 60\n        end_time = 17 * 60\n        \n        # Create a list of all time slots for the day\n        time_slots = []\n        for hour in range(9, 17):\n            for minute in range(0, 60):\n                time_slots.append((hour * 60 + minute, hour * 60 + minute + duration))\n        \n        # Filter time slots based on blocked times\n        available_slots = []\n        for slot in time_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            # Check if the time slot is within working hours\n            if 9 * 60 <= time_start < 17 * 60 and 9 * 60 <= time_end < 17 * 60:\n                # Check if the slot is available for both participants\n                if is_available(day_num, slot):\n                    available_slots.append(slot)\n        \n        # Find the first available slot that works for both participants\n        for slot in available_slots:\n            time_start, time_end = slot\n            print(f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d}:{time_end % 60:02d} {day}\")\n            return f\"{time_start // 60:02d}:{time_start % 60:02d}-{time_end // 60:02d} {day}\"\n    \n    # If no slot is found, return an error message\n    return \"No available time found.\"\n\ndef is_available(day_num, slot):\n    # Check Martha's schedule\n    blocked_martha = {\n        0: [(16 * 60, 17 * 60)],  # Monday\n        1: [(15 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30)],  # Tuesday\n        2: [(10 * 60, 11 * 60), (14 * 60, 14 * 60 + 30)]  # Wednesday\n    }\n    \n    if day_num in blocked_martha:\n        for start, end in blocked_martha[day_num]:\n            if start <= slot[0] < end:\n                return False\n    \n    # Check Beverly's schedule\n    blocked_beverly = {\n        0: [(9 * 60, 13 * 60 + 30), (14 * 60, 17 * 60)],  # Monday\n        1: [(9 * 60, 17 * 60)],  # Tuesday\n        2: [(9 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60 + 30), (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)]  # Wednesday\n    }\n    \n    if day_num in blocked_beverly:\n        for start, end in blocked_beverly[day_num]:\n            if start <= slot[0] < end:\n                return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
