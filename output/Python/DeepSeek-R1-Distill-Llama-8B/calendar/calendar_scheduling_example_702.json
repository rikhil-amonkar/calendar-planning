            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help schedule a meeting between Robert and Ralph. They both have pretty busy schedules, and I need to find a time that works for both of them. The meeting should be half an hour long, and it has to be between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n\nFirst, I should look at Robert's schedule. On Monday, he has meetings from 11:00 to 11:30, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:30 to 16:00. That leaves some gaps in his schedule. On Tuesday, he's busy from 10:30 to 11:00 and 15:00 to 15:30. On Wednesday, he has meetings from 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, and 15:00 to 15:30, along with 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nRalph's schedule is even more packed. On Monday, he's busy from 10:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 17:00. On Tuesday, he has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. On Wednesday, he's busy from 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:30, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nRobert wants to avoid more meetings on Monday, so I should look for a time on Tuesday or Wednesday. Ralph's schedule is pretty tight, so I need to find a time that doesn't conflict with his meetings either.\n\nLet me check Robert's availability on Tuesday. He's free from 11:00 to 10:30? Wait, that doesn't make sense. I think I need to look at his schedule more carefully. On Tuesday, Robert has a meeting from 10:30 to 11:00 and another from 15:00 to 15:30. So, he's free from 11:00 to 10:30, which is actually a negative time, so maybe I misread it. Perhaps he's free from 11:00 to 10:30, but that doesn't make sense because time can't go backward. Maybe it's a typo, and he's free from 11:00 to 10:30, which would mean he's busy during that time.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me write down Robert's schedule clearly.\n\nRobert's schedule:\n- Monday: 11:00-11:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00\n- Tuesday: 10:30-11:00, 15:00-15:30\n- Wednesday: 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n\nRalph's schedule:\n- Monday: 10:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-17:00\n- Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 14:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n- Wednesday: 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-14:30, 16:30-17:00\n\nNow, Robert wants to avoid more meetings on Monday, so I should look at Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Robert is busy from 10:30-11:00 and 15:00-15:30. So, he's free from 11:00-10:30 (which doesn't make sense) and also from 15:30-15:00 (again, negative time). It seems like he's busy from 10:30-11:00 and 15:00-15:30. So, the gaps would be before 10:30 and after 15:30.\n\nBut since the meeting needs to be at least half an hour, I need to find a time slot that doesn't overlap with their existing meetings.\n\nLet me look at Tuesday. After 15:00, Robert is free until 15:30. But Ralph is busy from 14:00-15:30 on Tuesday. So, that's a conflict.\n\nWhat about Wednesday? Let's check Robert's schedule on Wednesday. He's busy from 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-16:30. So, he's free from 14:00-15:00 and 13:00-13:30.\n\nRalph's schedule on Wednesday is 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-14:30, and 16:30-17:00. So, he's free from 14:30-16:30, but he's busy from 13:00-14:30.\n\nLooking at Robert's free time on Wednesday, from 14:00-15:00, that's a one-hour window. But Ralph is busy until 14:30. So, the latest they can start is 14:30, but the meeting is half an hour, so they need to end by 15:00.\n\nWait, but Ralph is busy until 14:30, so the meeting can't start after that. So, the latest they can start is 14:00 to finish by 14:30.\n\nBut Robert is free from 14:00-15:00. So, the latest they can start is 14:00.\n\nBut Ralph is busy until 14:30, so they can start at 14:00 and end at 14:30.\n\nBut Robert is free from 14:00-15:00, so that works.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nRobert's schedule on Wednesday:\n- 10:00-11:00\n- 11:30-12:00\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 13:30-14:00\n- 15:00-15:30\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nSo, he's free from 14:00-15:00.\n\nRalph's schedule on Wednesday:\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 11:30-12:00\n- 13:00-14:30\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nSo, he's free from 14:30-16:30.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled at 14:00-14:30 on Wednesday.\n\nThat seems to work for both of them.\n\nI think that's the earliest available time that works for both Robert and Ralph.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define the work hours for the day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday)\n    work_hours = [(9, 0), (17, 0)]  # (start hour, start minute), (end hour, end minute)\n\n    # Define the working day in minutes\n    work_day = 17 * 60 - 9 * 60  # 480 minutes (8 hours)\n\n    # Define the blocked times for each participant\n    robert_blocked = [\n        # Monday\n        ((11, 0), (11, 30)),\n        ((14, 0), (14, 30)),\n        ((15, 30), (16, 0)),\n        # Tuesday\n        ((10, 30), (11, 0)),\n        ((15, 0), (15, 30)),\n        # Wednesday\n        ((10, 0), (11, 0)),\n        ((11, 30), (12, 0)),\n        ((12, 30), (13, 0)),\n        ((13, 30), (14, 0)),\n        ((15, 0), (15, 30)),\n        ((16, 0), (16, 30))\n    ]\n    ralph_blocked = [\n        # Monday\n        ((10, 0), (13, 30)),\n        ((14, 0), (14, 30)),\n        ((15, 0), (17, 0)),\n        # Tuesday\n        ((9, 0), (9, 30)),\n        ((10, 0), (10, 30)),\n        ((11, 0), (11, 30)),\n        ((12, 0), (13, 0)),\n        ((14, 0), (15, 30)),\n        ((16, 0), (17, 0)),\n        # Wednesday\n        ((10, 30), (11, 0)),\n        ((11, 30), (12, 0)),\n        ((13, 0), (14, 30)),\n        ((16, 30), (17, 0))\n    ]\n\n    # Convert blocked times to minutes for easier comparison\n    robert_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in robert_blocked]\n    ralph_blocked = [(t[0], t[1]) for t in ralph_blocked]\n\n    # Function to check if a time is blocked by a participant\n    def is_blocked(start, end, participant):\n        # Convert start and end to minutes\n        start_min = start * 60\n        end_min = end * 60\n        # Check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked time\n        for block_start, block_end in participant:\n            if (start_min < block_end and end_min > block_start):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all possible start times within work hours\n    for day in [0, 1, 2]:  # 0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, 2=Wednesday\n        for start_h in range(9, 17):\n            for start_m in range(0, 60):\n                start_min = start_h * 60 + start_m\n                end_min = start_min + duration\n                if end_min > 17 * 60:\n                    continue  # End after work hours\n\n                # Check if this time slot is free for everyone\n                if not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, robert_blocked) and \\\n                   not is_blocked(start_min, end_min, ralph_blocked):\n                    print(f\"{start_h:02}:{start_m:02}-{start_h:02}:{end_min//60:02}\")\n                    print(\"Monday\" if day == 0 else\n                          \"Tuesday\" if day == 1 else\n                          \"Wednesday\")\n                    return\n\n    # If no slot found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    print(\"No available slot found\")\n\n# Run the function to find the meeting time\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
