            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Susan and Sandra. They both have pretty busy schedules, and there are some constraints to consider. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the days available: Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. The meeting needs to be a half-hour long between 9 AM and 5 PM. Susan has blocked specific times on each day, and Sandra has meetings scheduled on each day as well. Also, Susan prefers not to meet on Tuesday, and Sandra can't meet on Monday after 4 PM.\n\nOkay, starting with Monday. Susan is busy from 12:30 to 1 PM and 1:30 to 2 PM. Sandra has meetings from 9 AM to 1 PM and again from 2 to 3 PM, 4 to 5 PM, and 5:30 to 6 PM. Since the meeting needs to be half an hour, and Sandra can't meet after 4 PM on Monday, the latest we can start is 3:30 PM. But Susan is free from 2 PM to 3:30 PM. Wait, is that right? Let me check her schedule again.\n\nSusan is blocked on Monday from 12:30 to 1 PM and 1:30 to 2 PM. So, she's free from 2 PM to 12:30 PM? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I misread. Let me look again. Oh, she's blocked from 12:30 to 1 PM and 1:30 to 2 PM. So, she's free from 2 PM onwards until her next blocked time. Wait, no, she's blocked again at 12:30 PM, so that's mid-day. Maybe I need to visualize this better.\n\nLet me list out the time slots for Susan on Monday:\n\n- Blocked: 12:30 PM to 1 PM\n- Blocked: 1:30 PM to 2 PM\n\nSo, she's free from 9 AM to 12:30 PM, then from 2 PM to 1:30 PM? That doesn't add up. It must be that she's busy in those specific intervals, so the free times would be:\n\n- 9 AM to 12:30 PM\n- 2 PM to 1:30 PM (which doesn't make sense because 2 PM is after 1:30 PM). Hmm, maybe I need to consider that her schedule is non-overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list the free times as:\n\n- 9 AM to 12:30 PM\n- 2 PM to 12:30 PM? That can't be right. Maybe she's only busy during those specific blocks, so her free time is everything else.\n\nSimilarly, Sandra's schedule on Monday is:\n\n- Busy from 9 AM to 1 PM\n- Busy from 2 PM to 3 PM\n- Busy from 4 PM to 5 PM\n- Busy from 5:30 PM to 6 PM\n\nSo, Sandra is free from 1 PM to 2 PM and from 3 PM to 4 PM on Monday.\n\nGiven that, the only overlapping free time on Monday is from 1 PM to 2 PM when both Susan and Sandra are free. But wait, Susan is busy from 12:30 PM to 1 PM and 1:30 PM to 2 PM, so she's free from 2 PM onwards? No, that doesn't align. I think I need to correct my understanding.\n\nLet me create a timeline for both Susan and Sandra on Monday:\n\nSusan:\n- Busy: 12:30 PM to 1 PM\n- Busy: 1:30 PM to 2 PM\n\nSo, Susan is free from 9 AM to 12:30 PM, then from 2 PM onwards.\n\nSandra:\n- Busy: 9 AM to 1 PM\n- Busy: 2 PM to 3 PM\n- Busy: 4 PM to 5 PM\n- Busy: 5:30 PM to 6 PM\n\nSo, Sandra is free from 1 PM to 2 PM and from 3 PM to 4 PM.\n\nTherefore, the overlapping free time on Monday is from 1 PM to 2 PM when both are free.\n\nBut Susan is busy from 1:30 PM to 2 PM, so she's free until 1:30 PM, then busy again. Sandra is free from 1 PM to 2 PM. So, the latest they can start is 1:30 PM.\n\nBut the meeting needs to be half an hour, so starting at 1:30 PM would end at 2 PM. That should work because Susan is free until 1:30 PM, and Sandra is free until 2 PM.\n\nWait, but Susan is busy from 1:30 PM to 2 PM. So, she can't meet during that time. Therefore, the latest they can start is 1:30 PM, but that's when Susan is busy. So, the only possible time is before 1:30 PM.\n\nBut Sandra is free until 2 PM, so maybe 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM. Let me check Susan's schedule again.\n\nSusan is busy from 12:30 PM to 1 PM and 1:30 PM to 2 PM. So, she's free from 1 PM to 1:30 PM. Sandra is free from 1 PM to 2 PM. Therefore, the meeting can be scheduled from 1 PM to 1:30 PM.\n\nWait, but the duration is half an hour, so starting at 1 PM would end at 1:30 PM, which is within Susan's free time and Sandra's free time.\n\nBut Susan is busy from 1:30 PM to 2 PM, so the meeting can't start after 1:30 PM. Therefore, the latest start time is 1:00 PM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM, but Susan is busy until 1 PM. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try to list all possible half-hour slots on Monday where both are free.\n\nSusan's free slots on Monday:\n\n- 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM\n- 2:00 PM onwards\n\nSandra's free slots on Monday:\n\n- 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM\n- 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM\n\nThe overlapping free time is from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM.\n\nWithin that, the latest they can start is 1:30 PM to end at 2:00 PM, but Susan is busy from 1:30 PM to 2 PM, so she can't meet then.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible time is from 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM.\n\nSo, the meeting can be scheduled from 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\n'''python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the meeting duration in minutes\n    duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Convert start time to datetime.time object\n    start_time = datetime.time(9)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17)\n\n    # Define each person's busy intervals\n    susan_busy = [\n        datetime.time(12, 30), datetime.time(13, 0),\n        datetime.time(13, 30), datetime.time(14, 0)\n    ]\n    sandra_busy = [\n        datetime.time(9, 0), datetime.time(10, 0),\n        datetime.time(11, 0), datetime.time(12, 0),\n        datetime.time(14, 0), datetime.time(14, 30),\n        datetime.time(15, 0), datetime.time(15, 30),\n        datetime.time(16, 0), datetime.time(16, 30),\n        datetime.time(17, 0)\n    ]\n\n    # Convert busy intervals to time ranges\n    def convert_intervals(intervals):\n        all_time = set()\n        for h, m in intervals:\n            start = datetime.time(h, m)\n            end = start + datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)\n            all_time.add(start)\n            all_time.add(end)\n        return all_time\n\n    susan_busy = convert_intervals(susan_busy)\n    sandra_busy = convert_intervals(sandra_busy)\n\n    # Check each minute from start_time to end_time - duration\n    for minute in range(start_time.hour * 60, end_time.hour * 60 + 1):\n        current = datetime.time(minute // 60, minute % 60)\n        end = current + datetime.timedelta(minutes=duration)\n        end_time = end.time()\n\n        # Check if current minute is free for both\n        if (current not in susan_busy and\n            current not in sandra_busy):\n            # Check if the entire duration fits in the day\n            if end_time <= datetime.time(17, 0):\n                return f\"{current.hour:02d}:{current.minute:02d} to {end.hour:02d}:{end.minute:02d} on Monday\"\n\n    # If no slot found (shouldn't happen as per problem statement)\n    return \"No suitable time found\"\n\n# Get the result\nresult = find_meeting_time()\nprint(f\"{result}\")\n'''",
