            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to help schedule a meeting for Jacqueline, Harold, Arthur, and Kelly. The meeting should last half an hour between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. Each person has specific blocked times, and Harold doesn't want to meet after 13:00. \n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's busy periods:\n\n- Jacqueline: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 15:30-16:00.\n- Harold: 10:00-10:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-17:00.\n- Arthur: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-12:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00.\n- Kelly: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00.\n\nHarold's constraint is that he doesn't want to meet after 13:00, so the latest possible start time is 13:00.\n\nI'll start by identifying all possible time slots where none of the participants are busy. Let's go through each hour from 9:00 to 17:00 and see when all are free.\n\nFrom 9:00 to 9:30, Jacqueline and Kelly are busy, so that's out.\n\nFrom 9:30 to 10:00, only Arthur is busy until 10:00. So 9:30-10:00: Arthur is busy, so not available.\n\n10:00-10:30: Harold is busy, so no.\n\n10:30-11:00: Let's check each person. Jacqueline is free here (her next block is 11:00-11:30). Harold is busy until 10:30, so after that, he's free. Arthur is busy until 12:30. Kelly is busy until 11:00. So at 10:30-11:00, Kelly is still busy. So this slot is partially busy.\n\nWait, Kelly is busy until 11:00, so 10:30-11:00 is still within her busy time. So this slot isn't available.\n\nNext, 11:00-11:30: Jacqueline is busy, so no.\n\n11:30-12:00: Let's check. Jacqueline is free after 11:30 until 12:30. Harold is free after 10:30. Arthur is busy until 12:30. Kelly is busy until 12:30. So from 11:30-12:00, Kelly is still busy, so this slot is partially busy.\n\n12:00-12:30: Jacqueline is busy until 12:30. So this slot is partially busy.\n\n12:30-13:00: Jacqueline is free here, Harold is free after 10:30, Arthur is busy until 12:30. So 12:30-13:00: Arthur is busy until 12:30, so the slot starts at 12:30. Wait, Arthur's meeting ends at 12:30, so 12:30 is free. So from 12:30-13:00, let's check each person.\n\nJacqueline is free from 12:30 onwards. Harold is free. Arthur is free after 12:30. Kelly is busy until 14:00. So Kelly is busy from 12:30-14:00. So 12:30-13:00: Kelly is still busy. So this slot isn't available.\n\nWait, Kelly is busy from 11:30-12:30, but after that, she's busy from 14:00-15:00. Wait, no, looking back, Kelly's blocks are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00. So after 12:30, she's free until 14:00. So 12:30-13:00: Kelly is free. So in this slot, only Kelly is free? Wait no, because Kelly is busy until 12:30, so 12:30 is free. So from 12:30-13:00, Kelly is free. Let me check each person:\n\n- Jacqueline: free from 12:30 onwards.\n- Harold: free after 10:30.\n- Arthur: free after 12:30.\n- Kelly: free from 12:30 onwards.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is a possible slot. But Harold's constraint is that he doesn't want to meet after 13:00, so 13:00 is the latest start time.\n\nWait, but the meeting is half an hour, so if we start at 12:30, the meeting ends at 13:00. That's acceptable because Harold is free until 13:00, but he doesn't want to meet after 13:00. So starting at 12:30 would end at 13:00, which is exactly his constraint. Is that allowed? The problem says Harold doesn't want to meet on Monday after 13:00, so 13:00 is the latest he can start. So starting at 12:30 is fine.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if any other person is busy during 12:30-13:00.\n\nJacqueline is free, Harold is free, Arthur is free, Kelly is free. So that's a possible slot.\n\nNext, 13:00-13:30: Harold is busy until 13:30, so no.\n\n13:30-14:00: Let's check. Jacqueline is free from 13:00 onwards. Harold is free after 13:00. Arthur is busy until 14:30. Kelly is free from 14:00 onwards.\n\nSo 13:30-14:00: Arthur is busy until 14:30, so he's busy during this slot. So not available.\n\n14:00-14:30: Kelly is busy until 15:00, so no.\n\n14:30-15:00: Arthur is busy until 15:00, so no.\n\n15:00-15:30: Harold is busy until 17:00, so no.\n\n15:30-16:00: Jacqueline is busy, so no.\n\n16:00-16:30: Let's see. Jacqueline is busy until 16:00, so 16:00 is her next free time. Harold is busy until 17:00. Arthur is busy until 17:00. Kelly is busy until 16:00.\n\nSo 16:00-16:30: Kelly is busy until 16:00, so she's free after that. But Jacqueline is free from 16:00 onwards, Harold is free after 17:00, but 16:00-16:30 is before that. Wait, no, Harold is busy until 17:00, so he's busy during 16:00-17:00. So 16:00-16:30 is within his busy time, so Harold is busy. So this slot isn't available.\n\n16:30-17:00: Let's check. Jacqueline is free, Harold is busy until 17:00, Arthur is busy until 17:00, Kelly is free after 16:00. So 16:30-17:00: Harold and Arthur are busy. So not available.\n\nSo the only possible slot is 12:30-13:00. But let me make sure I didn't miss any other slots.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me go through each time slot again.\n\nFrom 9:00-9:30: busy.\n\n9:30-10:00: Arthur busy.\n\n10:00-10:30: Harold busy.\n\n10:30-11:00: Kelly busy.\n\n11:00-11:30: Jacqueline busy.\n\n11:30-12:00: Kelly busy.\n\n12:00-12:30: Jacqueline busy.\n\n12:30-13:00: All free except Kelly? Wait, no, Kelly is free from 12:30 onwards because her block ends at 12:30. So 12:30-13:00 is free for everyone.\n\n13:00-13:30: Harold busy.\n\n13:30-14:00: Arthur busy.\n\n14:00-14:30: Kelly busy.\n\n14:30-15:00: Arthur busy.\n\n15:00-15:30: Harold busy.\n\n15:30-16:00: Jacqueline busy.\n\n16:00-16:30: Kelly free, but Harold and Arthur busy.\n\n16:30-17:00: Harold and Arthur busy.\n\nSo the only available slot is 12:30-13:00.\n\nBut wait, let me check if any of the participants have a preference or any other constraints. The problem only mentions Harold's constraint about not meeting after 13:00, so starting at 12:30 is acceptable.\n\nSo the meeting can be scheduled from 12:30 to 13:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the working hours\n    start_time = datetime.time(9)\n    end_time = datetime.time(17)\n    \n    # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 for easier calculations\n    def time_to_min(t):\n        return t.hour * 60 + t.minute\n    \n    # Define each person's busy periods as sets of minutes since 9:00\n    jacqueline = {\n        (90, 30),  # 9:00-9:30\n        (660, 30), # 11:00-11:30\n        (780, 30), # 12:30-13:00\n        (990, 30)  # 15:30-16:00\n    }\n    \n    harold = {\n        (600, 30), # 10:00-10:30\n        (900, 30), # 13:00-13:30\n        (1080, 60) # 15:00-17:00\n    }\n    \n    arthur = {\n        (90, 30),  # 9:00-9:30\n        (600, 90), # 10:00-12:30\n        (1380, 30), # 14:30-15:00\n        (990, 30)  # 15:30-17:00\n    }\n    \n    kelly = {\n        (90, 30),  # 9:00-9:30\n        (600, 60), # 10:00-11:00\n        (690, 90), # 11:30-12:30\n        (840, 60), # 14:00-15:00\n        (990, 30)  # 15:30-16:00\n    }\n    \n    # Convert busy times to sets for easier checking\n    jacqueline = set(jaqueline for t in jacqueline for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    harold = set(harold for t in harold for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    arthur = set(arthur for t in arthur for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    kelly = set(kelly for t in kelly for t in [t[0], t[1]])\n    \n    # Check each possible time slot\n    for minute in range(540, 1080):  # 9:00 to 16:30 in 10-minute increments\n        if minute % 10 != 0:\n            continue\n        start = datetime.time(9, (minute // 10) % 6)\n        end = start + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\n        if end > datetime.time(17):\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the time slot is free for everyone\n        all_free = True\n        for person in [jacqueline, harold, arthur, kelly]:\n            if minute in person:\n                all_free = False\n                break\n        if all_free:\n            print(f\"{start.hour}:{start.minute}:{end.hour}:{end.minute} {start.weekday()}\")\n            return\n    \n    # If no slot found (though problem says there is one)\n    print(\"No available time found\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```",
