            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting for Bradley, Teresa, Elizabeth, and Christian on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Each of them has specific times when they're busy, and there are some constraints I need to consider. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's busy times:\n\n- **Bradley**: Blocked on Monday from 9:30 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, and 15:30 to 16:00.\n- **Teresa**: Has meetings Monday from 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, and 14:30 to 15:00.\n- **Elizabeth**: Busy Monday from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 17:00.\n- **Christian**: Has meetings Monday from 9:00 to 9:30 and from 10:30 to 17:00.\n\nThe goal is to find a 30-minute window where none of them are busy, considering their constraints. Let me visualize the day in 30-minute increments and see where everyone is free.\n\nStarting from 9:00 to 9:30:\n- Bradley is blocked from 9:30 to 10:00, so before 9:30 is free for him.\n- Teresa is free before 10:30.\n- Elizabeth is busy from 9:00 to 9:30.\n- Christian is busy until 9:30.\n\nSo, from 9:00 to 9:30, only Bradley and Christian are free, but Elizabeth is busy. So no slot here.\n\nNext, from 9:30 to 10:00:\n- Bradley is blocked.\n- Teresa is free until 10:30.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 10:30.\n- Christian is busy until 10:30.\n\nSo, no one is free here.\n\nFrom 10:00 to 10:30:\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is free until 10:30.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 10:30.\n- Christian is busy until 10:30.\n\nSo, only Bradley and Teresa are free here. Not enough.\n\nFrom 10:30 to 11:00:\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is busy from 10:30 to 11:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 11:30.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nNo one is free here.\n\nFrom 11:00 to 11:30:\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is busy until 12:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 11:30.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nOnly Bradley is free. Not enough.\n\nFrom 11:30 to 12:00:\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is busy until 12:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 12:30.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nOnly Bradley is free. Not enough.\n\nFrom 12:00 to 12:30:\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is busy until 12:30.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 12:30.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nOnly Bradley is free. Not enough.\n\nFrom 12:30 to 13:00:\n- Bradley is blocked.\n- Teresa is busy until 13:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 13:30.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nNo one is free here.\n\nFrom 13:00 to 13:30:\n- Bradley is blocked.\n- Teresa is busy until 13:30.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 13:30.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nNo one is free here.\n\nFrom 13:30 to 14:00:\n- Bradley is blocked.\n- Teresa is busy until 14:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 14:30.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nNo one is free here.\n\nFrom 14:00 to 14:30:\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is busy until 14:30.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 14:30.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nOnly Bradley is free. Not enough.\n\nFrom 14:30 to 15:00:\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is busy until 15:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 15:00.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nOnly Bradley is free. Not enough.\n\nFrom 15:00 to 15:30:\n- Bradley is blocked.\n- Teresa is busy until 15:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 15:00.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nNo one is free here.\n\nFrom 15:30 to 16:00:\n- Bradley is blocked.\n- Teresa is busy until 15:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 17:00.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nNo one is free here.\n\nFrom 16:00 to 16:30:\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is busy until 17:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 17:00.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nOnly Bradley is free. Not enough.\n\nFrom 16:30 to 17:00:\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is busy until 17:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 17:00.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nOnly Bradley is free. Not enough.\n\nWait, this can't be right. According to the problem, there must be a solution. Maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I need to consider that while some are busy, there might be overlapping free times. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's list out all the busy intervals and see where there are gaps.\n\n- **Bradley**: 9:30-10:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:30-16:00.\n- **Teresa**: 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00.\n- **Elizabeth**: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00.\n- **Christian**: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-17:00.\n\nCombining all busy intervals:\n\nFrom 9:00 to 9:30: Elizabeth is busy.\nFrom 9:30 to 10:00: Bradley is busy.\nFrom 10:00 to 10:30: Bradley is free, but Teresa is busy starting at 10:30.\nFrom 10:30 to 11:00: Teresa is busy.\nFrom 11:00 to 11:30: Bradley is free, but Elizabeth is busy until 11:30.\nFrom 11:30 to 12:00: Bradley is free, but Elizabeth is busy until 12:30.\nFrom 12:00 to 12:30: Teresa is busy.\nFrom 12:30 to 13:00: Bradley is busy.\nFrom 13:00 to 13:30: Teresa is busy, Elizabeth is busy.\nFrom 13:30 to 14:00: Bradley is busy.\nFrom 14:00 to 14:30: Bradley is free, but Teresa is busy until 14:30.\nFrom 14:30 to 15:00: Teresa is busy.\nFrom 15:00 to 15:30: Elizabeth is busy.\nFrom 15:30 to 16:00: Bradley is busy.\nFrom 16:00 to 16:30: Bradley is free, but others are busy.\nFrom 16:30 to 17:00: Bradley is free, but others are busy.\n\nIt seems like the only time when Bradley is free and others are not necessarily busy is from 16:00 to 16:30. But Teresa, Elizabeth, and Christian are all busy until 17:00. Wait, no, Christian is busy until 17:00, but maybe there's a window where others are free. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from 16:00 to 16:30, Bradley is free, but Teresa is busy until 17:00, Elizabeth is busy until 17:00, and Christian is busy until 17:00. So no one is free in that slot.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that some people have longer free periods. Let me look again.\n\nBradley is free from 10:00 to 9:30, but that's overlapping. Wait, no, Bradley's busy times are from 9:30 to 10:00, so he's free before 9:30 and after 10:00.\n\nWait, no, Bradley's blocked times are 9:30 to 10:00, so he's free from 9:00 to 9:30, and then from 10:00 onwards, but he has other blocks.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should make a timeline.\n\nLet me create a timeline from 9:00 to 17:00 in 30-minute increments and mark each person's busy times.\n\n- **Bradley**:\n  - 9:00-9:30: Free\n  - 9:30-10:00: Busy\n  - 10:00-10:30: Free\n  - 10:30-11:00: Free\n  - 11:00-11:30: Free\n  - 11:30-12:00: Free\n  - 12:00-12:30: Free\n  - 12:30-13:00: Busy\n  - 13:00-13:30: Busy\n  - 13:30-14:00: Busy\n  - 14:00-14:30: Free\n  - 14:30-15:00: Free\n  - 15:00-15:30: Busy\n  - 15:30-16:00: Busy\n  - 16:00-16:30: Free\n  - 16:30-17:00: Free\n\n- **Teresa**:\n  - 9:00-9:30: Free\n  - 9:30-10:00: Free\n  - 10:00-10:30: Free\n  - 10:30-11:00: Busy\n  - 11:00-11:30: Free\n  - 11:30-12:00: Free\n  - 12:00-12:30: Busy\n  - 12:30-13:00: Free\n  - 13:00-13:30: Busy\n  - 13:30-14:00: Free\n  - 14:00-14:30: Free\n  - 14:30-15:00: Busy\n  - 15:00-15:30: Free\n  - 15:30-16:00: Free\n  - 16:00-16:30: Free\n  - 16:30-17:00: Free\n\n- **Elizabeth**:\n  - 9:00-9:30: Busy\n  - 9:30-10:00: Free\n  - 10:00-10:30: Free\n  - 10:30-11:30: Busy\n  - 11:30-12:00: Free\n  - 12:00-12:30: Free\n  - 12:30-13:00: Free\n  - 13:00-13:30: Busy\n  - 13:30-14:00: Free\n  - 14:00-14:30: Free\n  - 14:30-15:00: Busy\n  - 15:00-15:30: Free\n  - 15:30-17:00: Busy\n\n- **Christian**:\n  - 9:00-9:30: Busy\n  - 9:30-10:00: Free\n  - 10:00-10:30: Free\n  - 10:30-17:00: Busy\n\nNow, let's look for a 30-minute window where all four are free.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n\n- 9:00-9:30: Elizabeth is busy.\n- 9:30-10:00: Bradley is busy.\n\nNext, 10:00-10:30:\n\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is free until 10:30.\n- Elizabeth is free until 10:30.\n- Christian is free until 10:30.\n\nSo, from 10:00-10:30, Bradley, Teresa, Elizabeth, and Christian are all free. That's a potential slot.\n\nWait, but Christian is free until 10:30, so yes, that works.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\n- Bradley is free from 10:00-10:30.\n- Teresa is free from 10:00-10:30.\n- Elizabeth is free from 10:00-10:30.\n- Christian is free from 9:30-10:00 and 10:00-10:30.\n\nSo, yes, 10:00-10:30 seems to be a free slot for everyone.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions constraints: Daniel does not want to meet on Wednesday, but that's not relevant here. Also, Bradley does not want to meet on Monday after 14:30, but we're meeting before that. Teresa does not want to meet on Monday after 12:00, but we're meeting before that. Christian does not want to meet on Friday, but we're meeting on Monday.\n\nSo, 10:00-10:30 on Monday seems to work.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possible slots.\n\nFrom 11:00-11:30:\n\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is free until 11:30.\n- Elizabeth is free until 11:30.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nSo, only Bradley, Teresa, and Elizabeth are free. Christian is busy.\n\nSo, 11:00-11:30 is not a solution.\n\nFrom 12:00-12:30:\n\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is busy until 12:30.\n- Elizabeth is free until 12:30.\n- Christian is busy.\n\nSo, only Bradley and Elizabeth are free. Not enough.\n\nFrom 13:00-13:30:\n\n- Bradley is busy.\n- Teresa is busy until 13:30.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 13:30.\n- Christian is busy.\n\nNo one is free here.\n\nFrom 14:00-14:30:\n\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is busy until 14:30.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 14:30.\n- Christian is busy.\n\nOnly Bradley is free. Not enough.\n\nFrom 15:00-15:30:\n\n- Bradley is busy.\n- Teresa is busy until 15:00.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 15:00.\n- Christian is busy.\n\nNo one is free here.\n\nFrom 16:00-16:30:\n\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is free.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 17:00.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nOnly Bradley and Teresa are free. Not enough.\n\nFrom 16:30-17:00:\n\n- Bradley is free.\n- Teresa is free.\n- Elizabeth is busy until 17:00.\n- Christian is busy until 17:00.\n\nOnly Bradley and Teresa are free. Not enough.\n\nSo, the earliest available slot is 10:00-10:30 on Monday.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any overlap I missed.\n\nBradley is free from 10:00-10:30, which is the same as Teresa and Elizabeth. Christian is free from 9:30-10:00 and 10:00-10:30, so yes, he's free during 10:00-10:30.\n\nTherefore, 10:00-10:30 on Monday is a valid meeting time.\n</think>\n\nThe suitable meeting time is **10:00 to 10:30** on Monday. \n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days):\n    # Convert schedules to time objects for easier manipulation\n    free_times = []\n    for person in participants:\n        free = []\n        for time in person:\n            start = datetime.time(hour=time[0], minute=time[1])\n            end = datetime.time(hour=time[2], minute=time[3])\n            free.append((start, end))\n        free_times.append(free)\n    \n    # Check each preferred day\n    for day in preferred_days:\n        day_free = True\n        for person in participants:\n            for time in person:\n                if time[0].date() == day.date():\n                    start = time[0]\n                    end = time[1]\n                    if not (end < start + meeting_duration):\n                        day_free = False\n                        break\n            if not day_free:\n                break\n        if day_free:\n            for time in participants[0]:\n                start = time[0]\n                end = time[1]\n                if start.date() == day.date() and end.date() == day.date():\n                    return f\"{start.strftime('%H:%M')}:{end.strftime('%H:%M')}: {day}\"\n    \n    # If no time found (though problem states there is a solution)\n    return \"No time found\"\n\n# Example usage\nparticipants = [\n    [\n        (\"09:30\", \"10:00\"),\n        (\"12:30\", \"13:00\"),\n        (\"13:30\", \"14:00\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"16:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"10:30\", \"11:00\"),\n        (\"12:00\", \"12:30\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"15:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n        (\"10:30\", \"11:30\"),\n        (\"13:00\", \"13:30\"),\n        (\"14:30\", \"15:00\"),\n        (\"15:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ],\n    [\n        (\"09:00\", \"09:30\"),\n        (\"10:30\", \"17:00\")\n    ]\n]\n\nmeeting_duration = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)\npreferred_days = [\"Monday\"]\n\nprint(find_meeting_time(participants, meeting_duration, preferred_days))\n```",
