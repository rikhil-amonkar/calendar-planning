            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to plan a meeting schedule in San Francisco considering the constraints of different people's availability and the travel times between locations. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the constraints. I arrive at Haight-Ashbury (HA) at 9:00 AM. I need to meet Sarah at Fisherman's Wharf (FW) for at least 105 minutes. Sarah is available from 2:45 PM to 5:30 PM. So, the earliest I can meet her is 2:45 PM, but I need to check if the travel time allows me to get there on time.\n\nNext, Mary is in the Richmond District (RD) from 1:00 PM to 7:15 PM. I need at least 75 minutes with her. Mary's time is earlier than Sarah's, so maybe I should meet her earlier in the day.\n\nHelen is in the Mission District (MD) from 9:45 PM to 10:30 PM, and I need 30 minutes with her. That's late in the day, so I'll have to plan for that after other meetings.\n\nThomas is at Bayview (BV) from 3:15 PM to 6:45 PM, and I need at least 120 minutes with him. That's a long meeting, so I should prioritize that.\n\nI start at HA at 9:00 AM. My goal is to maximize the number of friends met, so I need to fit as many meetings as possible within the day without overlapping and considering travel times.\n\nLet me outline possible meeting times:\n\n1. **Sarah at FW**: Available 14:45-17:30. I need at least 105 minutes. Let's see the travel time from HA to FW is 23 minutes. So I can leave HA at 14:45 - 23 = 14:22. But wait, I arrive at HA at 9:00, so I have to leave HA at some point before 14:45. Wait, no, I can choose when to leave HA to reach FW at or after 14:45. So the latest I can leave HA is 14:45 - 23 = 14:22. So if I meet Sarah at 14:45, I leave HA at 14:22, which is before her start time. That's okay.\n\n2. **Mary at RD**: Available 13:00-19:15. Need 75 minutes. Travel from HA to RD is 10 minutes. So if I meet Mary at 13:00, I need to leave HA at 12:50. That's feasible.\n\n3. **Thomas at BV**: Needs 120 minutes. He's available 15:15-18:45. The travel time from HA to BV is 18 minutes. If I leave HA at 15:15 - 18 = 14:57, but I can't do that because I have Mary at 13:00. Alternatively, maybe meet Thomas later.\n\n4. **Helen at MD**: Available 21:45-22:30. Travel time from HA to MD is 11 minutes. If I leave HA at 21:45 - 11 = 21:34, but I need to check if I can get back from MD to another location.\n\nWait, but I can only be at one place at a time. So I need to plan the order of meetings such that I don't have to travel back and forth without enough time.\n\nLet me try to fit as many meetings as possible.\n\nOption 1: Meet Mary first at RD.\n\n- Leave HA at 12:50 to arrive RD at 13:00. Meet her for 75 minutes until 14:15.\n\nThen go to FW to meet Sarah.\n\n- From RD to FW: RD to FW is 18 minutes. So leave RD at 14:15 + 18 = 14:33. Arrive at FW at 14:51.\n\nBut Sarah is available from 14:45. So arriving at 14:51 is okay. Meet her for 105 minutes until 16:36.\n\nThen, from FW to BV to meet Thomas.\n\nFrom FW to BV is 26 minutes. Leave at 16:36 + 26 = 17:02. Arrive at BV at 17:28.\n\nThomas is available until 18:45. So I can meet him from 17:28 to 18:48, which is 120 minutes.\n\nAfter that, from BV back to HA: 18 minutes. So leave BV at 18:48 + 18 = 19:06. Arrive at HA at 19:24.\n\nThen, from HA, maybe go to MD to meet Helen.\n\nFrom HA to MD is 11 minutes. Leave at 19:24 + 11 = 19:35. Arrive at MD at 19:46.\n\nHelen is available from 21:45. So I can leave MD at 19:46 and come back later. But I don't have time to meet her before 21:45. So maybe I can't meet her unless I adjust the schedule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Helen after Thomas.\n\nWait, let's see. If I meet Thomas until 18:48, then I can go to MD from BV.\n\nFrom BV to MD: 13 minutes (since Bayview to Mission District is 13). So leave BV at 18:48 + 13 = 19:01. Arrive at MD at 19:14.\n\nBut Helen is available from 21:45. So I can't meet her until then. So I have to leave MD at 19:14 and come back later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Thomas, go to MD and wait until 21:45, then meet Helen.\n\nSo from BV to MD: 19:01, then wait until 21:45. That's 2 hours and 44 minutes. Then meet Helen from 21:45 to 22:15 (30 minutes).\n\nThen, from MD back to HA: 12 minutes. Leave at 22:15 + 12 = 22:27. Arrive at HA at 22:39.\n\nSo the schedule would be:\n\n1. Meet Mary at RD from 13:00-14:15.\n\n2. Meet Sarah at FW from 14:51-16:36.\n\n3. Meet Thomas at BV from 17:28-18:48.\n\n4. Meet Helen at MD from 21:45-22:15.\n\nBut wait, the travel time from MD to HA is 12 minutes, so I can leave MD at 22:15 +12=22:27, arriving at HA at 22:39.\n\nIs this feasible? Let me check the timings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Thomas earlier. Let me see.\n\nIf I meet Sarah at 14:45, which is the earliest she can be met.\n\nSo leave HA at 14:45 -23=14:22. So I arrive at FW at 14:45.\n\nMeet Sarah from 14:45-16:30 (105 minutes).\n\nThen, go to RD to meet Mary. From FW to RD is 18 minutes. So leave at 16:30 +18=16:48. Arrive at RD at 17:06.\n\nMary is available until 19:15. So I can meet her from 17:06-18:21 (75 minutes).\n\nThen, go to BV to meet Thomas. From RD to BV is 26 minutes. Leave at 18:21 +26=18:47. Arrive at BV at 19:13.\n\nThomas is available until 18:45, so I can't meet him at 19:13. That's after his availability. So this approach won't work.\n\nSo perhaps meeting Sarah at 14:45 is too early because I can't meet Thomas later.\n\nAlternative approach: meet Mary at 13:00, then Sarah at 14:45, then Thomas at 17:28, then Helen at 21:45.\n\nBut as above, the issue is that after meeting Thomas at 18:48, I can't reach Helen in time.\n\nWait, maybe I can meet Helen earlier. But she's only available after 21:45. So I have to plan for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Helen first, but that would require me to be at MD from 21:45-22:15. But that's late in the day, so I might not have time to meet Sarah and Mary.\n\nSo the best approach is to meet Mary, Sarah, Thomas, and Helen.\n\nBut let me check the timings again.\n\nOption:\n\n1. Meet Mary at RD from 13:00-14:15.\n\n2. Meet Sarah at FW from 14:45-16:30.\n\n3. Meet Thomas at BV from 17:28-18:48.\n\n4. Meet Helen at MD from 21:45-22:15.\n\nBut after meeting Thomas at 18:48, I have to go to MD from BV, which takes 13 minutes, arriving at 19:01. Then wait until 21:45, which is 2h44m later. That's a lot of waiting, but it's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Helen earlier, but I don't think so.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n- Meet Mary at RD from 13:00-14:15.\n\n- Meet Sarah at FW from 14:45-16:30.\n\n- Meet Thomas at BV from 17:28-18:48.\n\n- Meet Helen at MD from 21:45-22:15.\n\nBut I need to make sure the travel times are correct.\n\nWait, from RD to FW: 18 minutes. So from RD departure at 14:15, arrive at 14:33. But Sarah is available at 14:45, so I can wait at FW until 14:45.\n\nSo the meeting with Sarah starts at 14:45.\n\nSimilarly, after meeting Sarah at 16:30, I go to RD, which takes 18 minutes, arriving at 16:48. Then meet Mary until 17:23 (75 minutes).\n\nThen go to BV, which is 26 minutes from RD, arriving at 17:49. But Thomas is available until 18:45. So I can meet him from 17:49-18:09 (20 minutes). That's not enough for 120 minutes. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. The meeting with Thomas needs to be at least 120 minutes. So I need to spend 120 minutes with him.\n\nSo if I arrive at BV at 17:49, I can meet him from 17:49 to 18:49 (exactly 120 minutes). But Thomas is available until 18:45, so that's a problem because I can't meet him beyond 18:45.\n\nSo this approach won't work.\n\nAlternative plan: Maybe meet Sarah later so that I can meet Thomas.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Meet Mary at RD from 13:00-14:15.\n\n2. Meet Sarah at FW from 15:00-16:45. Wait, but Sarah is available from 14:45. So I can meet her at 15:00.\n\nSo from RD to FW: 18 minutes. Leave RD at 14:15 +18=14:33, arrive at 14:51.\n\nBut Sarah is available from 14:45, so I can wait at FW until 15:00.\n\nMeet Sarah from 15:00-16:45 (105 minutes).\n\nThen, go to BV to meet Thomas. From FW to BV is 26 minutes. Leave at 16:45 +26=17:11, arrive at 17:37.\n\nThomas is available until 18:45. So I can meet him from 17:37-18:57 (120 minutes).\n\nThen, go to MD to meet Helen. From BV to MD is 13 minutes. Leave at 18:57 +13=19:10, arrive at 19:23.\n\nHelen is available from 21:45. So I have to wait from 19:23 until 21:45, which is 2h22m. That's a lot of waiting, but it's necessary.\n\nThen, meet Helen from 21:45-22:15 (30 minutes).\n\nFinally, return to HA from MD: 12 minutes. Leave at 22:15 +12=22:27, arrive at 22:39.\n\nSo the itinerary is:\n\n- Meet Mary at RD 13:00-14:15.\n\n- Meet Sarah at FW 15:00-16:45.\n\n- Meet Thomas at BV 17:37-18:57.\n\n- Meet Helen at MD 21:45-22:15.\n\nThis way, all constraints are met.\n\nLet me check the timings again:\n\nMary: 13:00-14:15 (75 min).\n\nSarah: 15:00-16:45 (105 min).\n\nThomas: 17:37-18:57 (120 min).\n\nHelen: 21:45-22:15 (30 min).\n\nTravel times:\n\nHA to RD: 10 min. Leave at 12:50, arrive 13:00.\n\nRD to FW: 18 min. Leave 14:15, arrive 14:33. Wait until 15:00.\n\nFW to BV:26 min. Leave 16:45, arrive 17:11. Wait until 17:37.\n\nBV to MD:13 min. Leave 18:57, arrive 19:10. Wait until 21:45.\n\nMD to HA:12 min. Leave 22:15, arrive 22:27.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo the final schedule includes meeting all four friends: Mary, Sarah, Thomas, and Helen.\n\nTherefore, the optimal schedule is to meet each of them in that order, ensuring all time constraints are satisfied.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to plan an optimal meeting schedule in San Francisco that maximizes the number of friends met while respecting the travel times and constraints provided. The goal is to meet Sarah, Mary, Helen, and Thomas at their respective locations with the required minimum meeting durations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Constraints**: Each friend has specific time slots available and required meeting durations. The objective is to fit these meetings into the day without overlapping and considering travel times.\n2. **Travel Times**: We need to account for the time it takes to travel between locations, ensuring that we arrive on time for each meeting.\n3. **Optimal Schedule**: By strategically ordering the meetings, we can maximize the number of friends met. The key is to schedule meetings in a sequence that allows for sufficient travel time between locations without causing delays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Define the travel times between locations\ntravel_times = {\n    'HA to FW': 23,\n    'HA to RD': 10,\n    'HA to MD': 11,\n    'HA to BV': 18,\n    'FW to HA': 22,\n    'FW to RD': 18,\n    'FW to MD': 22,\n    'FW to BV': 26,\n    'RD to HA': 10,\n    'RD to FW': 18,\n    'RD to MD': 20,\n    'RD to BV': 26,\n    'MD to HA': 12,\n    'MD to FW': 22,\n    'MD to RD': 20,\n    'MD to BV': 15,\n    'BV to HA': 19,\n    'BV to FW': 25,\n    'BV to RD': 25,\n    'BV to MD': 13\n}\n\n# Define the availability and required times for each person\nconstraints = {\n    'sarah': {'start': '14:45', 'end': '17:30', 'duration': 105},\n    'mary': {'start': '13:00', 'end': '19:15', 'duration': 75},\n    'helen': {'start': '21:45', 'end': '22:30', 'duration': 30},\n    'thomas': {'start': '15:15', 'end': '18:45', 'duration': 120}\n}\n\n# Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM for easier calculations\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    h, m = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return h * 60 + m\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    h = minutes // 60\n    m = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n\n# Convert all times to minutes\nstart_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 AM\navailable_times = {\n    'sarah': {'start_min': 14 * 60 + 45, 'end_min': 17 * 60 + 30},\n    'mary': {'start_min': 13 * 60, 'end_min': 19 * 60 + 15},\n    'helen': {'start_min': 21 * 60 + 45, 'end_min': 22 * 60 + 30},\n    'thomas': {'start_min': 15 * 60 + 15, 'end_min': 18 * 60 + 45}\n}\n\n# Function to calculate the latest possible departure time to arrive on time\ndef calculate_departure(arrival_time, meeting_time):\n    return arrival_time -

The meetings are scheduled in an order that maximizes the number of friends met while respecting their availability and the required meeting durations. The code converts the times into minutes since 9:00 AM for easier calculations and then converts them back to the required 24-hour format for the final output. The itinerary is structured to ensure that all travel times are accounted for, and the meetings are scheduled in a logical sequence to maximize efficiency.",
