            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco. The constraints are that I arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. I have two friends, Thomas and Kenneth, each with their own time windows and meeting duration requirements. I also have to consider the travel times between different locations.\n\nFirst, let me outline the given data. The travel distances between the areas are:\n\n- Nob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes.\n- Nob Hill to Mission District: 13 minutes.\n- Pacific Heights to Nob Hill: 8 minutes.\n- Pacific Heights to Mission District: 15 minutes.\n- Mission District to Nob Hill: 12 minutes.\n- Mission District to Pacific Heights: 16 minutes.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n- Thomas is at Pacific Heights from 3:30 PM to 7:15 PM. I need to meet him for at least 75 minutes.\n- Kenneth is at Mission District from 12:00 PM to 3:45 PM. I need to meet him for at least 45 minutes.\n\nI arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. So, I need to plan my day starting from there.\n\nI think the first step is to figure out the possible meeting times with each person, considering their availability and the travel times. Then, I need to see if I can fit both meetings into my day without exceeding the required meeting durations and without overlapping times.\n\nLet me start by considering meeting Kenneth first. He's available from 12:00 PM to 3:45 PM. The earliest I can meet him is 12:00 PM. But I need to account for travel time from Nob Hill to Mission District, which is 13 minutes. So, if I leave Nob Hill at 12:00 PM, I can arrive at Mission District at 12:13 PM. But Kenneth is available from 12:00 PM, so maybe I can meet him a bit later.\n\nWait, actually, the meeting time needs to be at least 45 minutes. So, the latest I can start the meeting is 3:45 PM minus 45 minutes, which is 3:00 PM. So, the latest start time with Kenneth is 3:00 PM.\n\nSimilarly, for Thomas, he's available from 3:30 PM to 7:15 PM. The earliest I can meet him is 3:30 PM, but I need at least 75 minutes, so the latest I can start is 7:15 PM minus 75 minutes, which is 6:40 PM.\n\nNow, considering that I can only be in one place at a time, I need to see if I can meet both Kenneth and Thomas on the same day. Let's see the possible time slots.\n\nIf I meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, that takes until 12:45 PM. Then, I need to travel back to Nob Hill, which takes 13 minutes, arriving at 12:58 PM. From there, I can go to Pacific Heights, which is 8 minutes, arriving at 1:06 PM. But Thomas isn't available until 3:30 PM, so that might be too early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Kenneth later. If I meet Kenneth at 2:00 PM, that's a 45-minute meeting, ending at 2:45 PM. Then, I need to travel back to Nob Hill, arriving at 2:58 PM. Then, I can go to Pacific Heights, arriving at 3:06 PM. But Thomas is available from 3:30 PM, so maybe I can meet him then.\n\nLet me check the time from 3:30 PM to 7:15 PM for Thomas. I need at least 75 minutes, so the latest I can start is 6:40 PM. If I meet Thomas at 3:30 PM, that takes until 4:45 PM. Then, I need to travel back to Nob Hill, which is 8 minutes, arriving at 4:53 PM. Then, I can go to Mission District, but Kenneth is already gone by 3:45 PM, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I can meet Kenneth earlier and Thomas later. Let me try meeting Kenneth at 12:00 PM, ending at 12:45 PM. Then, I go back to Nob Hill, arriving at 12:58 PM. Then, I can go to Pacific Heights, arriving at 1:06 PM. But Thomas isn't available until 3:30 PM, so I have a gap between 1:06 PM and 3:30 PM. Maybe I can do something else during that time, but I don't have any other meetings. Alternatively, perhaps I can meet Thomas earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I can meet Thomas first. If I go from Nob Hill to Pacific Heights, arriving at 9:08 AM (8 minutes). Then, I can meet Thomas starting at 9:08 AM. But Thomas isn't available until 3:30 PM, so that's too early. So I can't meet Thomas before 3:30 PM.\n\nSo, the earliest I can meet Thomas is 3:30 PM. Let's plan that. I leave Nob Hill at 3:30 PM minus travel time from Nob Hill to Pacific Heights, which is 8 minutes. So I leave at 3:22 PM, arrive at 3:30 PM. Meet Thomas for 75 minutes until 4:45 PM. Then, I need to go back to Nob Hill, which takes 8 minutes, arriving at 4:53 PM. Then, I can go to Mission District, which takes 13 minutes from Nob Hill, arriving at 5:06 PM. But Kenneth is available until 3:45 PM, so I can't meet him after that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Kenneth earlier and Thomas later. Let's see:\n\nMeet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, ending at 12:45 PM. Then, back to Nob Hill by 12:58 PM. Then, go to Pacific Heights, arriving at 1:06 PM. Then, can I meet Thomas at 3:30 PM? Let's see the timeline:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Arrive at Nob Hill.\n- 12:00 PM: Meet Kenneth from 12:00-12:45 PM.\n- 12:58 PM: Back at Nob Hill.\n- 1:06 PM: Arrive at Pacific Heights.\n- 3:30 PM: Meet Thomas from 3:30-4:45 PM.\n- 4:53 PM: Back at Nob Hill.\n- 5:06 PM: Arrive at Mission District, but Kenneth is already gone by 3:45 PM.\n\nSo, that works. I met Kenneth at 12:00 PM and Thomas at 3:30 PM. Both meetings are within their required durations.\n\nAlternatively, is there a better schedule? Maybe meeting Kenneth later to have more time for Thomas.\n\nIf I meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM, that's a 45-minute meeting until 1:45 PM. Then, back to Nob Hill by 1:58 PM. Then, go to Pacific Heights by 2:06 PM. Then, meet Thomas at 3:30 PM, which is 1 hour and 24 minutes later. That seems possible.\n\nSo, the schedule would be:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Arrive at Nob Hill.\n- 1:00 PM: Meet Kenneth from 1:00-1:45 PM in Mission District.\n- 1:58 PM: Back at Nob Hill.\n- 2:06 PM: Arrive at Pacific Heights.\n- 3:30 PM: Meet Thomas from 3:30-4:45 PM in Pacific Heights.\n- 4:53 PM: Back at Nob Hill.\n- 5:06 PM: Arrive at Mission District, but Kenneth is gone.\n\nThis seems better because it allows me to meet both without overlapping.\n\nWait, but let me check the travel times again. From Nob Hill to Mission District is 13 minutes, so leaving at 1:00 PM, I arrive at 1:13 PM. But I need to meet Kenneth from 1:00 PM, so I can start the meeting at 1:13 PM, but that's only 45 minutes, so it would end at 1:58 PM. Then, I need to go back to Nob Hill, which takes 13 minutes, arriving at 2:11 PM. Then, go to Pacific Heights, which is 8 minutes, arriving at 2:19 PM. Then, meet Thomas at 3:30 PM, which is 1 hour and 11 minutes later. That seems feasible.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me structure this properly.\n\nOption 1: Meet Kenneth first.\n\n- Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Mission District: 13 minutes, arrive at 9:13 AM.\n- Meet Kenneth from 9:13 AM to 9:13 +45 = 9:58 AM.\n- Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 minutes, arrive at 10:10 AM.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes, arrive at 10:18 AM.\n- Now, need to meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM.\n- So, from 10:18 AM to 3:30 PM, that's a gap of 5 hours and 12 minutes. I can do something else, but since the goal is to meet as many as possible, maybe this is not the best.\n\nOption 2: Meet Thomas first.\n\n- Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes, arrive at 9:08 AM.\n- Can't meet Thomas until 3:30 PM, so need to wait until then.\n- Meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM.\n- Then, go back to Nob Hill: 8 minutes, arrive at 4:53 PM.\n- Then, go to Mission District: 13 minutes, arrive at 5:06 PM. But Kenneth is gone by 3:45 PM, so can't meet him.\n\nSo, that's worse because I can't meet Kenneth.\n\nOption 3: Meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM.\n\n- 9:00 AM: Nob Hill.\n- 12:00 PM: Travel to Mission District (13 mins), arrive at 12:13 PM.\n- Meet Kenneth from 12:13 PM to 12:58 PM (45 mins).\n- Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 minutes, arrive at 1:10 PM.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes, arrive at 1:18 PM.\n- Now, need to meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM.\n- So, from 1:18 PM to 3:30 PM: 2 hours and 12 minutes. Maybe I can do something else, but again, I can't meet Kenneth anymore.\n\nOption 4: Meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM.\n\n- 9:00 AM: Nob Hill.\n- 1:00 PM: Travel to Mission District (13 mins), arrive at 1:13 PM.\n- Meet Kenneth from 1:13 PM to 1:58 PM (45 mins).\n- Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 mins, arrive at 2:10 PM.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 mins, arrive at 2:18 PM.\n- Now, need to meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM.\n- So, from 2:18 PM to 3:30 PM: 1 hour and 12 minutes. That's manageable.\n\nThis way, I can meet both Kenneth and Thomas.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact times:\n\n- Meet Kenneth at 1:13 PM, ends at 1:58 PM.\n- Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 minutes, so arrive at 2:10 PM.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes, arrive at 2:18 PM.\n- Now, I need to meet Thomas starting at 3:30 PM. So, from 2:18 PM to 3:30 PM is 1 hour and 12 minutes. That's fine.\n\nSo, the schedule would be:\n\n1. Meet Kenneth at Mission District from 1:13 PM to 1:58 PM.\n2. Return to Nob Hill by 2:10 PM.\n3. Go to Pacific Heights, arriving at 2:18 PM.\n4. Meet Thomas at Pacific Heights from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to meet Thomas earlier? Let me see.\n\nIf I meet Thomas at 3:30 PM, that's the earliest possible. So, I can't meet him before that.\n\nAnother option: meet Kenneth at 12:45 PM, but his availability is until 3:45 PM, but I need at least 45 minutes. So, meeting at 12:45 PM would end at 1:30 PM.\n\nWait, no, the meeting time needs to be at least 45 minutes. So, if I meet at 12:00 PM, that's 45 minutes until 12:45 PM. If I meet at 12:15 PM, that's 45 minutes until 1:00 PM, but Thomas is available from 3:30 PM.\n\nBut let me think again. If I meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, that's better because I can then go to Pacific Heights earlier to meet Thomas.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried that, I couldn't meet Thomas because of the time constraints.\n\nWait, let me try again:\n\n- Meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, ending at 12:45 PM.\n- Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 minutes, arrive at 12:57 PM.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes, arrive at 1:05 PM.\n- Now, I have time until 3:30 PM to do something. But I can't meet Thomas before 3:30 PM, so I have to wait.\n\nSo, from 1:05 PM to 3:30 PM is 2 hours and 25 minutes. That's a lot of time, but I can't do anything else because I need to meet Thomas.\n\nThen, meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM.\n\nThis is another possible schedule.\n\nSo, now I have two possible schedules:\n\n1. Meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM, then Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n2. Meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, then Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n\nWhich one is better? Let's see:\n\nIn the first case, I meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM, which is a 45-minute meeting, and then Thomas at 3:30 PM, which is a 75-minute meeting. That totals 120 minutes of meetings, which is good.\n\nIn the second case, I meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, which is 45 minutes, and Thomas at 3:30 PM, which is 75 minutes. Same total.\n\nBut in the first case, I can leave earlier to go to Pacific Heights, which might allow for more flexibility.\n\nWait, but in the second case, I'm back at Nob Hill at 12:57 PM, then go to Pacific Heights at 1:05 PM. That's a bit later than the first case, where I'm back at 2:10 PM.\n\nSo, perhaps the first case allows for more time in between, but in both cases, I can only meet Thomas once.\n\nIs there a way to meet both Kenneth and Thomas on the same day? Let me see.\n\nIf I meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, ending at 12:45 PM, then go back to Nob Hill by 12:57 PM, then go to Pacific Heights by 1:05 PM. Then, can I meet Thomas at 3:30 PM? Yes, that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if I meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM, ending at 1:58 PM, then go back to Nob Hill by 2:10 PM, then go to Pacific Heights by 2:18 PM. Then, meet Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n\nSo, both options work. Now, which one is better? Maybe the one where I have more time in between, but since the goal is to meet as many as possible, both are acceptable.\n\nWait, but the problem says to meet as many friends as possible. Since I can only meet Thomas and Kenneth, both options allow me to meet both. So, either schedule is fine.\n\nBut perhaps the first option (meeting Kenneth at 1:00 PM) allows for more time before meeting Thomas, but it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meeting Kenneth later allows me to meet Thomas earlier, but Thomas's earliest available time is 3:30 PM, so that's fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps I can meet Thomas earlier by adjusting the times. Let me check.\n\nThomas is available from 3:30 PM to 7:15 PM. I need at least 75 minutes. So, the latest I can start is 6:40 PM.\n\nIf I meet Thomas at 3:30 PM, that's 75 minutes, ending at 4:45 PM.\n\nIf I meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, ending at 12:45 PM, then back to Nob Hill by 12:57 PM, then to Pacific Heights by 1:05 PM. Then, from 1:05 PM to 3:30 PM, I have 2 hours and 25 minutes. I can't do anything else because I need to meet Thomas.\n\nAlternatively, if I meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM, ending at 1:58 PM, back to Nob Hill by 2:10 PM, then to Pacific Heights by 2:18 PM. Then, from 2:18 PM to 3:30 PM is 1 hour and 12 minutes. That's better because I can do something else in between, but since I can't meet anyone else, it's not necessary.\n\nSo, both options are valid. Now, I need to choose the one that allows for the earliest possible meeting times, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps the second option (meeting Kenneth at 12:00 PM) allows me to have a shorter wait time before meeting Thomas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first option is better because I can leave earlier to go to Pacific Heights, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: if I meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, I can then go to Pacific Heights earlier, but Thomas isn't available until 3:30 PM. So, in both cases, I can meet Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n\nSo, perhaps the choice between meeting Kenneth at 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM is arbitrary. But perhaps meeting Kenneth earlier allows for more flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM and Thomas at 3:30 PM, which is the same as the first option.\n\nWait, no, in the first option, I meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM, which is later, but that allows me to have a shorter time between meetings.\n\nI think either way is fine, but I need to pick one.\n\nLet me outline the steps for both options.\n\nOption A:\n\n1. Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Mission District: 13 minutes, arrive at 9:13 AM.\n3. Meet Kenneth from 9:13 AM to 9:58 AM (45 minutes).\n4. Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 minutes, arrive at 10:10 AM.\n5. Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes, arrive at 10:18 AM.\n6. Now, need to wait until 3:30 PM to meet Thomas.\n7. Meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM in Pacific Heights.\n8. Travel back to Nob Hill: 8 minutes, arrive at 4:53 PM.\n9. Travel to Mission District: 13 minutes, arrive at 5:06 PM, but Kenneth is already gone.\n\nOption B:\n\n1. Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Mission District: 13 minutes, arrive at 9:13 AM.\n3. Meet Kenneth from 9:13 AM to 9:58 AM (45 minutes).\n4. Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 minutes, arrive at 10:10 AM.\n5. Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes, arrive at 10:18 AM.\n6. Now, wait until 3:30 PM.\n7. Meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM in Pacific Heights.\n8. Travel back to Nob Hill: 8 minutes, arrive at 4:53 PM.\n9. Travel to Mission District: 13 minutes, arrive at 5:06 PM, but Kenneth is gone.\n\nWait, that's the same as option A.\n\nWait, no, in option A, I met Kenneth at 9:13 AM, which is earlier, but Thomas's earliest meeting is 3:30 PM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, which is later, allowing me to have more time before meeting Thomas.\n\nOption C:\n\n1. Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Mission District: 13 minutes, arrive at 9:13 AM.\n3. Meet Kenneth from 12:00 PM to 12:45 PM (45 minutes).\n4. Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 minutes, arrive at 12:57 PM.\n5. Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes, arrive at 1:05 PM.\n6. Now, wait until 3:30 PM.\n7. Meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM in Pacific Heights.\n8. Travel back to Nob Hill: 8 minutes, arrive at 4:53 PM.\n9. Travel to Mission District: 13 minutes, arrive at 5:06 PM, but Kenneth is gone.\n\nThis is another option where I meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meeting Kenneth at 1:00 PM allows me to have a shorter wait time.\n\nOption D:\n\n1. Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Mission District: 13 minutes, arrive at 9:13 AM.\n3. Meet Kenneth from 1:00 PM to 1:58 PM (45 minutes).\n4. Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 minutes, arrive at 2:10 PM.\n5. Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes, arrive at 2:18 PM.\n6. Now, wait until 3:30 PM.\n7. Meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM in Pacific Heights.\n8. Travel back to Nob Hill: 8 minutes, arrive at 4:53 PM.\n9. Travel to Mission District: 13 minutes, arrive at 5:06 PM, but Kenneth is gone.\n\nSo, in this case, I have a shorter wait time after meeting Kenneth.\n\nBut in all cases, I can only meet both Kenneth and Thomas once each.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM and Thomas at 3:30 PM, or meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM and Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n\nBut I need to choose the one that allows for the earliest possible meeting times, or perhaps the one that maximizes the total meeting time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meeting Kenneth at 12:00 PM allows for more flexibility in the schedule.\n\nWait, but in both cases, I can only meet both friends once. So, the choice is between meeting Kenneth at 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM.\n\nI think the best approach is to meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM and Thomas at 3:30 PM, as that allows me to have a shorter wait time before meeting Thomas.\n\nWait, but in that case, I'm back at Pacific Heights at 1:05 PM, which is earlier than 2:18 PM in option D.\n\nSo, perhaps that's better because I have more time to do other things, but since I can't meet anyone else, it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meeting Kenneth later allows me to have a more balanced schedule.\n\nBut I think either way is acceptable. However, to maximize the number of friends met, both options are valid.\n\nNow, I need to structure the itinerary.\n\nThe JSON should have an \"itinerary\" list with two meetings: one with Kenneth and one with Thomas.\n\nSo, the first meeting would be either with Kenneth at 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM, and the second with Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n\nI think the best approach is to meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM because it allows me to get to Pacific Heights earlier, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me calculate the exact times for both options.\n\nOption 1: Meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM.\n\n- Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Mission District: 13 mins, arrive 9:13 AM.\n- Meet Kenneth from 9:13 AM to 9:58 AM (45 mins).\n- Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 mins, arrive 10:10 AM.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 mins, arrive 10:18 AM.\n- Now, wait until 3:30 PM.\n- Meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM in Pacific Heights.\n- Travel back to Nob Hill: 8 mins, arrive 4:53 PM.\n- Travel to Mission District: 13 mins, arrive 5:06 PM, but Kenneth is gone.\n\nOption 2: Meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM.\n\n- Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Mission District: 13 mins, arrive 9:13 AM.\n- Meet Kenneth from 1:00 PM to 1:58 PM (45 mins).\n- Travel back to Nob Hill: 12 mins, arrive 2:10 PM.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights: 8 mins, arrive 2:18 PM.\n- Meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM in Pacific Heights.\n- Travel back to Nob Hill: 8 mins, arrive 4:53 PM.\n- Travel to Mission District: 13 mins, arrive 5:06 PM, but Kenneth is gone.\n\nIn both cases, the total meeting time is 90 minutes (45 + 75).\n\nBut in Option 1, I'm back at Pacific Heights earlier (10:18 AM) compared to 2:18 PM in Option 2.\n\nSo, perhaps Option 1 is better because I can do something else earlier, but since I can't meet anyone else, it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Option 2 is better because I have less time between meetings, but that's not a problem.\n\nI think either option is acceptable. However, perhaps Option 1 allows for more flexibility.\n\nWait, but in Option 1, I'm meeting Kenneth at 9:13 AM, which is earlier, but Thomas is available from 3:30 PM. So, the time between 10:18 AM and 3:30 PM is 5 hours and 12 minutes. That's a lot of time, but I can't do anything else.\n\nIn Option 2, the time between 2:18 PM and 3:30 PM is 1 hour and 12 minutes. That's better.\n\nSo, perhaps Option 2 is better because the wait time between meetings is shorter.\n\nTherefore, I think the best schedule is:\n\n1. Meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM in Mission District.\n2. Return to Nob Hill at 2:10 PM.\n3. Go to Pacific Heights, arriving at 2:18 PM.\n4. Meet Thomas at 3:30 PM in Pacific Heights.\n\nThis way, the wait time between meetings is shorter, which might be preferable.\n\nSo, the JSON should reflect this itinerary.\n\nNow, I need to structure the code to compute this.\n\nThe code will need to:\n\n- Read the travel times and constraints.\n- Calculate the earliest and latest possible meeting times for each friend.\n- Determine the optimal schedule that fits both meetings without overlapping.\n\nThe code will have variables for the travel times and the constraints.\n\nThen, it will calculate the possible meeting times for each friend, considering their availability and the required duration.\n\nThen, it will check if both meetings can be scheduled without overlapping.\n\nIf yes, it will output the itinerary.\n\nSo, the code will involve:\n\n- Parsing the input variables.\n- Calculating possible meeting times for each person.\n- Selecting the best possible schedule.\n\nI'll structure the code with functions to calculate meeting times.\n\nFirst, define the locations and their travel times.\n\nThen, for each person, calculate the possible time windows.\n\nFor Kenneth:\n\n- Available from 12:00 PM to 3:45 PM.\n- Needs at least 45 minutes.\n\nSo, the latest he can start is 3:45 PM - 45 minutes = 3:00 PM.\n\nSo, possible meeting times are from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, but considering travel times.\n\nSimilarly, for Thomas:\n\n- Available from 3:30 PM to 7:15 PM.\n- Needs at least 75 minutes, so latest start time is 6:40 PM.\n\nSo, possible meeting times from 3:30 PM to 6:40 PM.\n\nThen, the code will need to calculate the earliest possible time to arrive at each location for each meeting.\n\nFor example, for Kenneth:\n\nIf I leave Nob Hill at time T, I arrive at Mission District at T + 13 minutes.\n\nThe meeting starts at T + 13 minutes, ends at T + 13 + 45 = T + 58 minutes.\n\nThis must be within Kenneth's available time, which is 12:00 PM to 3:45 PM.\n\nSo, T + 58 \u2264 3:45 PM.\n\nThus, T \u2264 3:45 PM - 58 minutes = 3:27 PM.\n\nSo, the latest I can leave Nob Hill to meet Kenneth is 3:27 PM, arriving at 3:40 PM, meeting until 4:18 PM.\n\nBut I need to arrive at Mission District before 3:45 PM.\n\nAlternatively, the earliest I can leave Nob Hill is 9:00 AM, but that's too early because Kenneth isn't available until 12:00 PM.\n\nSo, the earliest I can leave Nob Hill to meet Kenneth is when I arrive at Mission District by 12:00 PM.\n\nSo, T + 13 \u2264 12:00 PM => T \u2264 11:47 AM.\n\nBut I can't leave Nob Hill before 9:00 AM.\n\nSo, the earliest I can leave Nob Hill is 9:00 AM, arriving at 9:13 AM, but Kenneth isn't available until 12:00 PM.\n\nSo, the meeting can't start before 12:00 PM.\n\nThus, the meeting must start at or after 12:00 PM.\n\nSo, T + 13 \u2265 12:00 PM => T \u2265 11:47 AM.\n\nBut I can't leave before 9:00 AM.\n\nSo, the earliest I can leave is 9:00 AM, arriving at 9:13 AM, but the meeting can't start until 12:00 PM.\n\nThus, the meeting starts at 12:00 PM, ends at 12:45 PM.\n\nThen, I need to travel back to Nob Hill, arriving at 12:13 PM + 13 minutes = 12:26 PM.\n\nWait, no, the travel time from Mission District to Nob Hill is 12 minutes, so arriving at 12:26 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, which takes 8 minutes, arriving at 12:34 PM.\n\nBut Thomas isn't available until 3:30 PM.\n\nSo, I have to wait until 3:30 PM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Kenneth earlier by adjusting the departure times.\n\nWait, perhaps I can leave Nob Hill later to arrive at Mission District earlier.\n\nWait, but I can't leave before 9:00 AM.\n\nSo, the earliest I can arrive at Mission District is 9:13 AM, but Kenneth isn't available until 12:00 PM.\n\nThus, the meeting must start at 12:00 PM.\n\nSo, the meeting is from 12:00 PM to 12:45 PM.\n\nThen, I need to go back to Nob Hill, arriving at 12:26 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, arriving at 12:34 PM.\n\nThen, wait until 3:30 PM to meet Thomas.\n\nSo, that's the schedule.\n\nAlternatively, if I meet Kenneth at 1:00 PM, that's a 45-minute meeting, ending at 1:45 PM.\n\nThen, I need to travel back to Nob Hill, arriving at 1:58 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, arriving at 2:06 PM.\n\nThen, meet Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n\nThis seems better because the wait time between meetings is shorter.\n\nSo, in code, I need to calculate the possible meeting times for each person, considering their availability and the required duration, as well as the travel times.\n\nThe code will:\n\n1. Read the input parameters (travel times and constraints).\n2. For each person, calculate the earliest and latest possible meeting times.\n3. Check if both meetings can fit into the day without overlapping.\n4. If yes, output the itinerary.\n\nSo, let's structure the code.\n\nFirst, define the locations with their travel times.\n\nlocations = {\n    'Nob Hill': {\n        'Pacific Heights': 8,\n        'Mission District': 13,\n        'Pacific Heights': 8,\n        'Mission District': 15,\n        'Mission District': 12,\n        'Pacific Heights': 16\n    },\n    'Pacific Heights': {\n        'Nob Hill': 8,\n        'Mission District': 15,\n        'Nob Hill': 8,\n        'Mission District': 16,\n        'Mission District': 12,\n        'Nob Hill': 8\n    },\n    'Mission District': {\n        'Nob Hill': 13,\n        'Pacific Heights': 16,\n        'Nob Hill': 12,\n        'Pacific Heights': 16,\n        'Nob Hill': 13,\n        'Pacific Heights': 16\n    }\n}\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to have a dictionary where each location has its travel times to the others.\n\nlocations = {\n    'Nob Hill': {\n        'to Pacific Heights': 8,\n        'to Mission District': 13,\n        'from Pacific Heights': 8,\n        'from Mission District': 12\n    },\n    'Pacific Heights': {\n        'to Nob Hill': 8,\n        'to Mission District': 15,\n        'from Nob Hill': 8,\n        'from Mission District': 16\n    },\n    'Mission District': {\n        'to Nob Hill': 13,\n        'to Pacific Heights': 16,\n        'from Nob Hill': 12,\n        'from Pacific Heights': 16\n    }\n}\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to have a function to calculate travel time between two locations.\n\nAlternatively, have a distance matrix.\n\ndistance = {\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Pacific Heights'): 8,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Mission District'): 13,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Nob Hill'): 8,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Mission District'): 15,\n    ('Mission District', 'Nob Hill'): 12,\n    ('Mission District', 'Pacific Heights'): 16\n}\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo, the code will have this distance matrix.\n\nThen, for each person, calculate possible meeting times.\n\nFor Kenneth:\n\navailable_start = datetime.time(12, 0)\navailable_end = datetime.time(15, 45)\n\nrequired_duration = 45\n\nSo, latest_start = available_end - datetime.timedelta(minutes=required_duration)\n\nlatest_start = available_start + datetime.timedelta(minutes=available_end - available_start) - required_duration\n\nWait, no. The latest start time is available_end - required_duration.\n\nSo, latest_start = available_end - datetime.timedelta(minutes=required_duration)\n\nBut available_end is 3:45 PM, so latest_start is 3:00 PM.\n\nSo, the meeting must start between available_start and latest_start.\n\nSimilarly, for Thomas:\n\navailable_start = datetime.time(15, 30)\navailable_end = datetime.time(19, 15)\n\nrequired_duration = 75\n\nlatest_start = available_end - datetime.timedelta(minutes=required_duration) = 19:15 - 1:15 = 18:00, which is 6:00 PM.\n\nBut Thomas is available until 7:15 PM, so the latest start time is 7:15 PM -75 minutes = 6:40 PM.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nSo, for each person, calculate the possible meeting times.\n\nThen, for each possible meeting time, calculate the arrival time at the meeting location, considering travel time from the starting point.\n\nThe starting point is Nob Hill, as I arrive there at 9:00 AM.\n\nSo, for Kenneth:\n\nFor each possible start_time from available_start to latest_start:\n\n- departure_time = start_time - travel_time from location to Nob Hill.\n\nWait, no. Wait, I'm starting at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n\nTo meet Kenneth, I need to go to Mission District.\n\nSo, the departure time from Nob Hill is arrival_time_in_Mission_District - travel_time.\n\nBut the meeting can't start before 12:00 PM.\n\nSo, the earliest I can arrive at Mission District is 12:00 PM.\n\nThus, departure_time = arrival_time - travel_time.\n\nBut arrival_time must be >= 12:00 PM.\n\nSo, for Kenneth:\n\nmeeting_start_time = datetime.time(12, 0)\n\nmeeting_end_time = meeting_start_time + datetime.timedelta(minutes=45)\n\nlatest_possible_meeting_start = datetime.time(15, 0) - datetime.timedelta(minutes=45) = 14:15, but actually, it's 3:45 PM -45 mins = 3:00 PM.\n\nWait, no. available_end is 3:45 PM, so latest_start is 3:00 PM.\n\nSo, for Kenneth, possible meeting times are from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM.\n\nFor each possible start_time in 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM:\n\n- departure_time = start_time - travel_time_to_Mission_District (13 minutes)\n\nBut I can't leave before 9:00 AM.\n\nSo, departure_time must be >= 9:00 AM.\n\nThus, start_time must be >= 9:00 AM + 13 minutes = 9:13 AM.\n\nBut since start_time is at least 12:00 PM, that's fine.\n\nSo, for each start_time from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM:\n\n- departure_time = start_time - 13 minutes.\n\nIf departure_time >= 9:00 AM, it's valid.\n\nThen, arrival_time = departure_time + 13 minutes (to Mission District).\n\nSo, arrival_time is start_time.\n\nWait, no. Because departure_time is start_time - 13 minutes, and arrival_time is departure_time + 13 minutes, which is start_time.\n\nSo, the arrival_time is start_time.\n\nThen, the meeting ends at start_time + 45 minutes.\n\nThis must be <= available_end (3:45 PM).\n\nSo, for each start_time from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM:\n\n- meeting ends at start_time +45 mins.\n\nIf start_time +45 <= 15:45, it's valid.\n\nSo, start_time <= 15:45 -45 = 15:00, which is 3:00 PM.\n\nWhich is consistent.\n\nSo, the earliest start_time is 12:00 PM, latest 3:00 PM.\n\nSo, for Kenneth, possible start times are 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM.\n\nSimilarly, for Thomas:\n\navailable_start = 15:30 (3:30 PM)\n\navailable_end = 19:15 (7:15 PM)\n\nrequired_duration =75 mins\n\nlatest_start = 19:15 -75 = 18:00 (6:00 PM), but Thomas is available until 19:15, so latest_start is 19:15 -75 = 18:00, but 18:00 is 6:00 PM, which is earlier than 19:15.\n\nWait, no. latest_start = available_end - required_duration = 19:15 -75 = 18:00 (6:00 PM).\n\nBut Thomas is available until 19:15, so the meeting can start as late as 18:00 +75 =19:15.\n\nSo, the latest start time is 18:00.\n\nBut Thomas is available from 3:30 PM to 7:15 PM.\n\nSo, the meeting can start from 3:30 PM to 6:40 PM (7:15 -75 mins).\n\nSo, for Thomas, possible start times are 15:30 to 18:00.\n\nNow, the code needs to find a time to meet Kenneth and a time to meet Thomas, such that both meetings are possible given the travel times.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each possible meeting time with Kenneth (12:00 PM to 3:00 PM):\n\n   a. Calculate the departure time from Nob Hill: start_time - 13 mins.\n\n   b. Check if departure time is >=9:00 AM.\n\n   c. Calculate arrival time: start_time.\n\n   d. The meeting ends at start_time +45.\n\n   e. Then, after the meeting, I need to travel back to Nob Hill: arrival_time +13 mins.\n\n   f. Then, travel to Pacific Heights: arrival_back_Nob_Hill +8 mins.\n\n   g. Then, meet Thomas at some time between 3:30 PM and 6:40 PM, with at least 75 mins.\n\n   h. Check if the time after arriving at Pacific Heights allows for meeting Thomas.\n\n2. For each possible meeting time with Thomas (3:30 PM to 6:40 PM):\n\n   a. Calculate departure time from Nob Hill: start_time -8 mins (since Pacific Heights is 8 mins away).\n\n   b. Check if departure time is >=9:00 AM.\n\n   c. Calculate arrival time: start_time.\n\n   d. The meeting ends at start_time +75 mins.\n\n   e. Then, travel back to Nob Hill: arrival_time +8 mins.\n\n   f. Then, travel to Mission District: arrival_back_Nob_Hill +13 mins.\n\n   g. Check if this is after Kenneth's available time.\n\nSo, the code will need to loop through possible meeting times for Kenneth and Thomas, and check if their schedules can fit without overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to fix the order: meet Kenneth first, then Thomas, or vice versa.\n\nBut given that I can only be in one place at a time, I need to choose the order that allows both meetings.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to meet Kenneth first, then Thomas.\n\nAlternatively, meet Thomas first, then Kenneth.\n\nBut given the constraints, perhaps meeting Kenneth first is better because he's available earlier in the day.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nLet me try to code this.\n\nFirst, import datetime.\n\nThen, define the distance matrix.\n\ndistance = {\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Pacific Heights'): 8,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Mission District'): 13,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Nob Hill'): 8,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Mission District'): 15,\n    ('Mission District', 'Nob Hill'): 12,\n    ('Mission District', 'Pacific Heights'): 16\n}\n\nThen, for each person, calculate possible meeting times.\n\nFor Kenneth:\n\navailable_start = datetime.time(12, 0)\navailable_end = datetime.time(15, 45)\nrequired_duration = 45\n\nlatest_kenneth_start = available_end - datetime.timedelta(minutes=required_duration)\nlatest_kenneth_start = datetime.time(15, 0) - datetime.timedelta(minutes=45)  # 3:00 PM\n\nearliest_kenneth_start = available_start  # 12:00 PM\n\nFor Thomas:\n\navailable_start = datetime.time(15, 30)\navailable_end = datetime.time(19, 15)\nrequired_duration = 75\n\nlatest_thomas_start = available_end - datetime.timedelta(minutes=required_duration)\nlatest_thomas_start = datetime.time(18, 0)  # 6:00 PM\n\nearliest_thomas_start = available_start  # 3:30 PM\n\nNow, the code will need to find a time to meet Kenneth and Thomas such that:\n\n- The departure time for Kenneth is after 9:00 AM.\n\n- The departure time for Thomas is after the time when I finish meeting Kenneth and return to Nob Hill and go to Pacific Heights.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to fix the order: meet Kenneth first, then Thomas.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Meet Kenneth at some time between 12:00 PM and 3:00 PM.\n\n2. Return to Nob Hill, then go to Pacific Heights.\n\n3. Meet Thomas at some time between 3:30 PM and 6:40 PM.\n\nSo, the code will loop through possible Kenneth meeting times, and for each, check if a Thomas meeting time is possible.\n\nSimilarly, the code can loop through possible Thomas meeting times and check if Kenneth can be met.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to loop through Kenneth first.\n\nSo, the code will:\n\nfor kenneth_start in range(earliest_kenneth_start, latest_kenneth_start +1, 15):  # every 15 minutes\n\n   # calculate departure time from Nob Hill: kenneth_start - 13 mins\n\n   departure_kenneth = kenneth_start - datetime.timedelta(minutes=13)\n\n   if departure_kenneth < datetime.time(9,0):\n\n       continue\n\n   arrival_kenneth = kenneth_start\n\n   meeting_end_kenneth = arrival_kenneth + datetime.timedelta(minutes=45)\n\n   if meeting_end_kenneth > available_end:\n\n       continue\n\n   # now, after meeting, go back to Nob Hill\n\n   departure_back = arrival_kenneth + datetime.timedelta(minutes=13)\n\n   arrival_back = departure_back\n\n   # then go to Pacific Heights\n\n   departure_pacific = arrival_back + datetime.timedelta(minutes=8)\n\n   arrival_pacific = departure_pacific\n\n   # now, need to meet Thomas at some time after arrival_pacific\n\n   # Thomas's latest start is 6:40 PM\n\n   # So, the earliest Thomas can start is max(arrival_pacific, 3:30 PM)\n\n   # and latest is 6:40 PM\n\n   earliest_thomas_start = max(arrival_pacific, datetime.time(15,30))\n\n   if earliest_thomas_start > latest_thomas_start:\n\n       continue\n\n   # find the latest possible Thomas start time\n\n   latest_thomas_start_possible = latest_thomas_start\n\n   # calculate the departure time for Thomas: latest_thomas_start_possible -8 mins\n\n   departure_thomas = latest_thomas_start_possible - datetime.timedelta(minutes=8)\n\n   if departure_thomas < datetime.time(9,0):\n\n       continue\n\n   arrival_thomas = departure_thomas\n\n   meeting_end_thomas = arrival_thomas + datetime.timedelta(minutes=75)\n\n   if meeting_end_thomas > available_end:\n\n       continue\n\n   # if all times are valid, then this is a possible schedule\n\n   # construct the itinerary\n\nSo, in code, this would involve nested loops and checks.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find the latest possible meeting time for Kenneth that allows Thomas to be met.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible Kenneth start time, calculate the time I arrive at Pacific Heights, then see if I can meet Thomas.\n\nIf yes, then record the schedule.\n\nSimilarly, for each possible Thomas start time, calculate the time I arrive at Pacific Heights, then see if I can meet Kenneth.\n\nBut this could be computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, since the possible times are limited, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the code will:\n\n- Try to meet Kenneth first, then Thomas.\n\n- For each possible Kenneth start time from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM:\n\n   a. Calculate departure time from Nob Hill: start_time -13.\n\n   b. If departure time is before 9:00 AM, skip.\n\n   c. Calculate arrival time at Mission District: start_time.\n\n   d. Meeting ends at start_time +45.\n\n   e. Travel back to Nob Hill: arrival +13, which is start_time +13 +13 = start_time +26.\n\n   f. Travel to Pacific Heights: start_time +26 +8 = start_time +34.\n\n   g. Now, I need to meet Thomas at some time after start_time +34.\n\n   h. Thomas's latest start time is 6:40 PM.\n\n   i. So, the latest I can start meeting Thomas is 6:40 PM.\n\n   j. The earliest I can start meeting Thomas is max(start_time +34, 3:30 PM).\n\n   k. If the earliest start time is after 6:40 PM, skip.\n\n   l. Otherwise, find the latest possible start time for Thomas: 6:40 PM.\n\n   m. Calculate departure time for Thomas: latest_thomas_start -8.\n\n   n. If departure time is before 9:00 AM, skip.\n\n   o. Calculate arrival time at Pacific Heights: latest_thomas_start.\n\n   p. Meeting ends at latest_thomas_start +75.\n\n   q. If meeting ends after Thomas's available end time (7:15 PM), skip.\n\n   r. If all times are valid, construct the itinerary.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom datetime import time, timedelta\n\ndistance = {\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Pacific Heights'): 8,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Mission District'): 13,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Nob Hill'): 8,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Mission District'): 15,\n    ('Mission District', 'Nob Hill'): 12,\n    ('Mission District', 'Pacific Heights'): 16\n}\n\nitinerary = []\n\n# Calculate for Kenneth\navailable_kenneth_start = time(12, 0)\navailable_kenneth_end = time(15, 45)\nrequired_kenneth_duration = 45\n\nlatest_kenneth_start = available_kenneth_end -
