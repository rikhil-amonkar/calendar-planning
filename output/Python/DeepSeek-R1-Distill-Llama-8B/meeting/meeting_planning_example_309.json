            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to schedule meetings with different friends in San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering the travel times and each friend's availability. Let me break down the problem and figure out how to approach it.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input parameters. The travel times are provided between various locations like Financial District, Chinatown, Alamo Square, Bayview, and Fisherman's Wharf. Each friend has specific time slots when they're available and the minimum duration they're willing to meet.\n\nI arrive at the Financial District at 9:00 AM. My starting point is here, so all my travel times will be calculated from this location. Each friend has different availability:\n\n- **Nancy** is at Chinatown from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM. I need to meet her for at least 90 minutes.\n- **Mary** is at Alamo Square from 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM. I need at least 75 minutes with her.\n- **Jessica** is at Bayview from 11:15 AM to 1:45 PM. She requires at least 45 minutes.\n- **Rebecca** is at Fisherman's Wharf from 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM. I need 45 minutes with her.\n\nMy task is to create a schedule that includes as many of these meetings as possible without overlapping and considering the travel times between locations.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Constraints\n\nEach meeting has a start and end time, and each friend has a minimum duration. I need to ensure that each meeting starts and ends within the friend's availability and that the total duration meets the minimum requirement.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Travel Times\n\nI need to calculate the time it takes to travel between each location. For example, traveling from Financial District to Chinatown takes 5 minutes, while traveling from Financial District to Bayview takes 19 minutes.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Possible Meeting Times\n\nFor each friend, I'll determine the possible times I can meet them, considering my arrival time and the travel time to their location. I'll also ensure that the meeting duration fits within their availability.\n\n### Step 4: Schedule Meetings\n\nI need to schedule these meetings in an order that doesn't overlap and maximizes the number of meetings. This might involve trying different combinations, but for simplicity, I'll start by scheduling the earliest possible meetings.\n\n### Step 5: Implement in Python\n\nI'll write a Python program that reads the travel times and constraints, then computes the optimal schedule. The program will convert times to minutes for easier calculations and then convert them back to the required 24-hour format for the output.\n\n### Possible Challenges\n\n- **Overlapping Meetings**: I need to ensure that each meeting doesn't overlap with the previous one.\n- **Travel Time Consideration**: Each meeting's start time must account for the travel time from the previous location.\n- **Friend Availability**: Each meeting must fit within the friend's available time slot.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Convert Times to Minutes**: This makes it easier to perform arithmetic operations to check for overlaps and calculate possible meeting times.\n2. **Generate Possible Meetings**: For each friend, generate a list of possible meeting times that fit within their availability and the travel time from my current location.\n3. **Sort Meetings by Start Time**: To maximize the number of meetings, I'll try to schedule the earliest possible meetings first.\n4. **Check for Overlaps**: Ensure that each meeting doesn't overlap with the previous one and that there's enough time to travel to the next location.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\n# Read input travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    # From Financial District (FD)\n    \"FD\": {\n        \"Chinatown (CT)\": 5,\n        \"Alamo Square (AS)\": 17,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 19,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 10,\n    },\n    # From Chinatown (CT)\n    \"CT\": {\n        \"FD\": 5,\n        \"AS\": 17,\n        \"BV\": 22,\n        \"FW\": 8,\n    },\n    # From Alamo Square (AS)\n    \"AS\": {\n        \"FD\": 17,\n        \"CT\": 16,\n        \"BV\": 16,\n        \"FW\": 19,\n    },\n    # From Bayview (BV)\n    \"BV\": {\n        \"FD\": 19,\n        \"CT\": 18,\n        \"AS\": 16,\n        \"FW\": 25,\n    },\n    # From Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\n    \"FW\": {\n        \"FD\": 11,\n        \"CT\": 12,\n        \"AS\": 20,\n        \"BV\": 26,\n    },\n}\n\n# Read constraints\nconstraints = {\n    \"Nancy\": {\n        \"start\": \"9:30\",\n        \"end\": \"13:30\",\n        \"location\": \"Chinatown (CT)\",\n        \"duration\": 90,\n    },\n    \"Mary\": {\n        \"start\": \"7:00\",\n        \"end\": \"21:00\",\n        \"location\": \"Alamo Square (AS)\",\n        \"duration\": 75,\n    },\n    \"Jessica\": {\n        \"start\": \"11:15\",\n        \"end\": \"13:45\",\n        \"location\": \"Bayview (BV)\",\n        \"duration\": 45,\n    },\n    \"Rebecca\": {\n        \"start\": \"7:00\",\n        \"end\": \"8:30\",\n        \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\",\n        \"duration\": 45,\n    },\n}\n\n# Starting location is Financial District (FD) at 9:00 AM\nstart_time = \"9:00\"\n\ndef compute_schedule():\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    import itertools\n\n    # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    def time_to_min(t):\n        h, m = map(int, t.split(':'))\n        return h * 60 + m\n\n    def min_to_time(m):\n        hours = m // 60\n        minutes = m % 60\n        return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n    # Convert all constraints to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    constraintsConvert = {}\n    for name, constr in constraints.items():\n        start = time_to_min(constr[\"start\"])\n        end = time_to_min(constr[\"end\"])\n        constraintsConvert[name] = {\n            \"start\": start,\n            \"end\": end,\n            \"location\": constr[\"location\"],\n            \"duration\": constr[\"duration\"],\n        }\n\n    locations = [\"FD\", \"CT\", \"AS\", \"BV\", \"FW\"]\n\n    # Generate possible meeting times for each person\n    possible_meetings = {}\n\n    for person in constraintsConvert:\n        person_constraints = constraintsConvert[person]\n        possible_meetings[person] = []\n        for loc in locations:\n            if loc == person_constraints[\"location\"]:\n                continue\n            travel_time = travel_times[f\"{loc} to {person_constraints['location']}\"]\n            earliest_meet = person_constraints[\"start\"] + travel_time\n            latest_meet = person_constraints[\"end\"] -
