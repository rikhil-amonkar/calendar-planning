            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help write a Python program to schedule meetings in San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, starting from the Financial District at 9:00 AM. There are two people I need to meet: Kenneth in Chinatown from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and Barbara in the Golden Gate Park from 8:15 AM to 7:00 PM. \n\nFirst, I'll need to consider the travel times between the Financial District and each location. The travel times provided are:\n\n- Financial District to Chinatown: 5 minutes\n- Financial District to Golden Gate Park: 23 minutes\n- Chinatown to Financial District: 5 minutes\n- Chinatown to Golden Gate Park: 23 minutes\n- Golden Gate Park to Financial District: 26 minutes\n- Golden Gate Park to Chinatown: 23 minutes\n\nI should start by calculating the earliest and latest possible meeting times for each person. For Kenneth, who's in Chinatown from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, I need to factor in the travel time from Financial District to Chinatown, which is 5 minutes. So, if I leave the Financial District at 9:00 AM, I can arrive in Chinatown by 9:05 AM. But Kenneth isn't available until 12:00 PM, so the earliest I can meet him is at 12:00 PM.\n\nSimilarly, for Barbara in the Golden Gate Park, who's available from 8:15 AM to 7:00 PM, the travel time is 23 minutes. If I leave at 9:00 AM, I can be at the Golden Gate Park by 9:23 AM. Since she's available starting at 8:15 AM, I can meet her as early as 9:23 AM, but I need to check if that's within her availability.\n\nWait, but she's available from 8:15 AM, so 9:23 AM is within her window. However, I need to ensure that the meeting duration is at least 45 minutes. If I meet her at 9:23 AM, the meeting would end at 10:18 AM. That seems doable.\n\nNow, considering both meetings, I need to see if I can fit both into my schedule without overlapping. Kenneth is available until 3:00 PM, and Barbara until 7:00 PM. If I meet Barbara first at 9:23 AM, ending at 10:18 AM, then I can leave for Chinatown. The travel time back to Financial District from Chinatown is 5 minutes, so I'd arrive by 10:23 AM. Kenneth is available from 12:00 PM, so there's a gap between 10:23 AM and 12:00 PM. Maybe I can do something else during that time, but since I only need to meet Kenneth and Barbara, perhaps I can meet Kenneth right after Barbara.\n\nAlternatively, I could meet Kenneth first. If I leave at 9:00 AM, arrive in Chinatown by 9:05 AM, but Kenneth isn't available until 12:00 PM. So, I'd have to wait until 12:00 PM to meet him. That would mean meeting Kenneth from 12:00 PM to 1:45 PM (since he's available for 45 minutes). Then, I can travel to the Golden Gate Park, which takes 23 minutes, arriving at 1:45 PM. Barbara is available until 7:00 PM, so I can meet her from 1:45 PM to 2:30 PM. \n\nThis seems more efficient because I can meet both without too much waiting. Meeting Barbara earlier might leave me with more time in the afternoon, but since both meetings are important, it's better to meet the one that fits best.\n\nSo, the optimal schedule would be:\n\n1. Meet Barbara at the Golden Gate Park from 9:23 AM to 10:18 AM.\n2. Return to Financial District by 10:23 AM.\n3. Travel to Chinatown, arrive at 10:23 AM, but wait until 12:00 PM to meet Kenneth from 12:00 PM to 1:45 PM.\n4. Then, go to the Golden Gate Park again, arrive at 1:45 PM, and meet Barbara again from 1:45 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\nWait, but meeting Barbara twice might not be necessary. Maybe I can meet her once and Kenneth once. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf I meet Barbara at 9:23 AM, then go to Chinatown at 10:23 AM, wait until 12:00 PM to meet Kenneth from 12:00 PM to 1:45 PM, then go to the Golden Gate Park at 1:45 PM to meet Barbara again from 1:45 PM to 2:30 PM. That way, I meet both Barbara and Kenneth, but Barbara is met twice, which might not be ideal. Perhaps I can adjust the times to meet each person once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Kenneth first. Leave at 9:00 AM, arrive in Chinatown at 9:05 AM, wait until 12:00 PM to meet him from 12:00 PM to 1:45 PM. Then, go to the Golden Gate Park, arrive at 1:45 PM, and meet Barbara from 1:45 PM to 2:30 PM. That way, I meet each person once, and both meetings are within their availability windows.\n\nThis seems better. So the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Kenneth at Chinatown from 12:00 PM to 1:45 PM.\n2. Meet Barbara at the Golden Gate Park from 1:45 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\nThis way, I'm using my time effectively, meeting both friends without overlapping schedules. The travel times are manageable, and the meetings are within the required durations. I think this is the optimal schedule.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Define travel times from Financial District to each location\ntravel_times = {\n    'Financial District': {\n        'Chinatown': 5,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 23\n    },\n    'Chinatown': {\n        'Financial District': 5,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 23\n    },\n    'Golden Gate Park': {\n        'Financial District': 26,\n        'Chinatown': 23\n    }\n}\n\n# List of people with their details\npeople = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Kenneth',\n        'location': 'Chinatown',\n        'start_time': '12:00',\n        'end_time': '3:00',\n        'duration': 90,\n        'travel_time': 5\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Barbara',\n        'location': 'Golden Gate Park',\n        'start_time': '8:15',\n        'end_time': '7:00',\n        'duration': 45,\n        'travel_time': 23\n    }\n]\n\n# Function to calculate feasible meeting times\ndef calculate_feasible_meetings(people, travel_times):\n    meetings = []\n    for person in people:\n        location = person['location']\n        start_time = person['start_time']\n        end_time = person['end_time']\n        duration = person['duration']\n        travel_time = travel_times['Financial District'][location]\n        \n        # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n        earliest_start_min = (int(start_time.replace(':', '')) * 60) + 540  # 9:00 AM in minutes\n        latest_start_min = (int(end_time.replace(':', '')) * 60) - duration\n        \n        # Ensure earliest start is at least 9:00 AM\n        if earliest_start_min < 540:\n            earliest_start_min = 540\n        \n        if latest_start_min < earliest_start_min:\n            continue  # No possible meeting time\n        \n        meetings.append({\n            'name': person['name'],\n            'location': location,\n            'start_time': earliest_start_min,\n            'end_time': latest_start_min\n        })\n    \n    return meetings\n\n# Calculate feasible meeting times\nfeasible_meetings = calculate_feasible_meetings(people, travel_times)\n\n# Sort meetings by end time\nfeasible_meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x['end_time'])\n\n# Select non-overlapping meetings\nitinerary = []\nfor meeting in feasible_meetings:\n    start = meeting['start_time']\n    end = meeting['end_time']\n    if not itinerary or end <= itinerary[-1]['end_time']:\n        itinerary.append(meeting)\n\n# Convert time to 24-hour format strings\nitinerary = [\n    {\n        'action': 'meet',\n        'location': meeting['location'],\n        'person': meeting['name'],\n        'start_time': f\"{meeting['start_time'] // 60 + (meeting['start_time'] % 60 // 10)}:{meeting['start_time'] % 60 // 10 * 10}\",\n        'end_time': f\"{meeting['end_time'] // 60 + (meeting['end_time'] % 60 // 10)}:{meeting['end_time'] % 60 // 10 * 10}\"\n    }\n    for meeting in itinerary\n]\n\n# Generate JSON output\noutput = {\n    \"itinerary\": itinerary\n}\n\nprint(json.dumps(output))\n```",
