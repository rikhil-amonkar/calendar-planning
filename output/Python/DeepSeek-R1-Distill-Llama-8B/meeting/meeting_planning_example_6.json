The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and each person's availability. Let me break down the problem and figure out how to approach it.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input parameters. There are two locations: Fisherman's Wharf and Nob Hill. The travel distance between them is 11 minutes each way. I arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. The only friend I need to meet is Kenneth, who is available from 2:15 PM to 7:45 PM, and we need at least 90 minutes together.\n\nSo, the main task is to determine the best time to meet Kenneth, considering both travel time and our availability.\n\nI'll start by defining the travel times in a dictionary. Since there are only two locations, it's straightforward. Then, I'll set the current location to Fisherman's Wharf and the current time to 9:00 AM.\n\nNext, I'll list the people I need to meet. In this case, only Kenneth. His location is Nob Hill, with his availability window and required duration.\n\nI'll sort the people by the duration they need, but since there's only one person, it doesn't matter much here.\n\nNow, I'll loop through each person to see if I can meet them. For Kenneth, I need to check if I can reach Nob Hill in time to meet him for at least 90 minutes.\n\nI'll calculate the earliest possible start time by adding the travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill to my current time (9:00 AM). That would be 9:00 AM + 11 minutes = 9:11 AM.\n\nI need to check if this earliest time fits within Kenneth's availability. His latest start time is 7:45 PM - 90 minutes = 6:55 PM. So, 9:11 AM is before 6:55 PM, so it's feasible.\n\nBut maybe I can wait longer to meet him, allowing me to have a more convenient meeting time. So, I'll calculate the latest possible start time, which is 6:55 PM. If I can reach Nob Hill by then, I can meet him for the full duration.\n\nI'll then create the meeting entry with the latest possible start time, ensuring the meeting ends before Kenneth's availability ends.\n\nAfter meeting Kenneth, there are no more people to meet, so the itinerary will only have one meeting.\n\nFinally, I'll convert the itinerary to JSON format and print it.\n\nI need to make sure the code handles all these steps correctly, converting times to and from datetime objects, and ensuring the meeting fits within the constraints.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n```python\n# Read the input parameters and create a dictionary of travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': {\n        'Nob Hill': 11,\n    },\n    'Nob Hill': {\n        'Fisherman\\'s Wharf': 11,\n    }\n}\n\n# Define the current location and time\ncurrent_location = 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'\ncurrent_time = '9:00'\n\nitinerary = []\n\n# List of people with their constraints\npeople = [\n    {'name': 'Kenneth', 'location': 'Nob Hill', 'start': '14:15', 'end': '19:45', 'duration': 90},\n]\n\n# Sort people by duration in descending order\npeople_sorted = sorted(people, key=lambda x: -x['duration'])\n\nimport datetime\n\nfor person in people_sorted:\n    # Calculate the latest possible start time considering current location and travel time\n    location = person['location']\n    if current_location not in travel_times:\n        continue  # Skip if current location is not in the travel times\n    if location not in travel_times[current_location]:\n        continue  # Skip if location is not reachable from current location\n    travel_time = travel_times[current_location][location]\n    \n    # Convert current_time to datetime object\n    current_dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(current_time, \"%H:%M\")\n    \n    # Calculate earliest possible start time\n    earliest_possible_start = current_dt + datetime.timedelta(minutes=travel_time)\n    earliest_possible_start = earliest_possible_start.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)\n    \n    # Check if earliest possible start is within the person's availability\n    start_dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(person['start'], \"%H:%M\")\n    end_dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(person['end'], \"%H:%M\")\n    \n    if earliest_possible_start > end_dt:\n        continue  # Not possible to meet this person\n    \n    # Ensure that the meeting duration fits within the person's availability\n    if (end_dt - earliest_possible_start).total_seconds() < (person['duration'] * 60):\n        continue  # Not enough time to meet\n    \n    # Calculate the latest possible start time to maximize remaining time\n    latest_possible_start = end_dt - datetime.timedelta(minutes=person['duration'])\n    if latest_possible_start < current_dt:\n        latest_possible_start = current_dt\n    \n    # Choose the latest possible start time\n    start_dt = latest_possible_start\n    \n    # Check if the calculated start time is valid\n    if start_dt < current_dt:\n        continue  # Not possible to meet this person\n    \n    # Create the meeting entry\n    meeting = {\n        'action': 'meet',\n        'location': location,\n        'person': person['name'],\n        'start_time': start_dt.strftime(\"%H:%M\"),\n        'end_time': (start_dt + datetime.timedelta(minutes=person['duration'])).strftime(\"%H:%M\")\n    }\n    itinerary.append(meeting)\n    \n    # Update current location and time\n    current_location = location\n    current_time = meeting['end_time']\n\n# Convert the itinerary to JSON format\nimport json\nprint(json.dumps(itinerary))\n```",
