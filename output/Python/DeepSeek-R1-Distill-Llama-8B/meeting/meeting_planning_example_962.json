            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the optimal meeting schedule for the user in San Francisco. They want to meet as many friends as possible, but each has specific time windows and location constraints. The user arrives at The Castro at 9:00 AM, so that's the starting point.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the people and their availability:\n\n- Elizabeth is at Marina District from 7:00 PM to 8:45 PM. They need 105 minutes.\n- Joshua is at Presidio from 8:30 AM to 1:15 PM. Needs 105 minutes.\n- Timothy is at North Beach from 7:45 PM to 10:00 PM. Needs 90 minutes.\n- David is at Embarcadero from 10:45 AM to 12:30 PM. Needs 30 minutes.\n- Kimberly is at Haight-Ashbury from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM. Needs 75 minutes.\n- Lisa is at Golden Gate Park from 5:30 PM to 9:45 PM. Needs 45 minutes.\n- Ronald is at Richmond District from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM. Needs 90 minutes.\n- Stephanie is at Alamo Square from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. Needs 30 minutes.\n- Helen is at Financial District from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM. Needs 45 minutes.\n- Laura is at Sunset District from 5:45 PM to 9:15 PM. Needs 90 minutes.\n\nThe user starts at The Castro at 9:00 AM. They can meet Ronald at Richmond District from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM, but since they arrive at 9:00 AM, they can meet him until 9:30 AM. That's a 30-minute meeting, but Ronald needs 90 minutes. So that doesn't work. Maybe they can't meet Ronald.\n\nNext, they can go to Presidio to meet Joshua, who's available from 8:30 AM. The travel time from The Castro to Presidio is 20 minutes. They arrive at 9:20 AM, which is within Joshua's availability. Joshua needs 105 minutes, so the meeting would end at 10:25 AM. That works. So they meet Joshua from 9:20 to 10:25 AM.\n\nAfter that, they can go to Embarcadero to meet David from 10:45 AM to 12:30 PM. The travel time from Presidio to Embarcadero is 20 minutes, so they leave Presidio at 10:25 AM, arrive at 10:45 AM. They meet David for 30 minutes until 11:15 AM.\n\nThen, they can go to North Beach to meet Timothy from 7:45 PM to 10:00 PM. But they need to manage the rest of their day. Let's see the timeline so far:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Arrive at Castro.\n- 9:20 AM: Meet Joshua at Presidio until 10:25 AM.\n- 10:25 AM: Travel to Embarcadero, arrive at 10:45 AM.\n- 10:45 AM: Meet David until 11:15 AM.\n- Next, they can go to Haight-Ashbury to meet Kimberly from 4:45 PM. The travel time from Embarcadero to Haight-Ashbury is 20 minutes, so they leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:35 AM. Kimberly is available until 9:30 PM, so they can meet her from 11:35 AM to 5:50 PM (11:35 + 75 mins).\n\nAfter that, they can go to Golden Gate Park to meet Lisa from 5:30 PM to 9:45 PM. The travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Golden Gate Park is 7 minutes, so they leave at 5:50 PM, arrive at 5:57 PM. Lisa is available until 9:45 PM, so they meet her from 5:57 PM to 6:42 PM.\n\nNext, they can go to Sunset District to meet Laura from 5:45 PM to 9:15 PM. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Sunset District is 11 minutes, so they leave at 6:42 PM, arrive at 6:53 PM. Laura is available until 9:15 PM, so they meet her from 6:53 PM to 8:23 PM.\n\nAfter that, they can go to Alamo Square to meet Stephanie from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. They need to arrive before 3:30 PM. The travel time from Sunset District to Alamo Square is 16 minutes, so they leave at 8:23 PM, which is after Stephanie's availability. So that doesn't work. Maybe they need to adjust the order.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Laura, they can go to Alamo Square earlier. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Laura until 8:23 PM, they can go to Alamo Square from 8:23 PM to 8:39 PM (16 minutes travel). But Stephanie is available from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. So they can't meet her after 4:30 PM. Maybe they need to meet her earlier.\n\nPerhaps they should meet Stephanie before meeting Laura. So after meeting David, they can go to Alamo Square from 11:15 AM to 11:35 AM (20 minutes). Then meet Stephanie from 11:35 AM to 12:05 PM. Then go to Haight-Ashbury, but Kimberly is available until 9:30 PM, so that might be possible.\n\nWait, but they need to meet as many as possible. Let's see the current itinerary:\n\n1. Meet Joshua at Presidio from 9:20 to 10:25 AM.\n2. Meet David at Embarcadero from 10:45 to 11:15 AM.\n3. Meet Kimberly at Haight-Ashbury from 11:35 to 5:50 PM.\n4. Meet Lisa at Golden Gate Park from 5:57 to 6:42 PM.\n5. Meet Laura at Sunset District from 6:53 to 8:23 PM.\n\nThat's five people. Can they fit more?\n\nThey can try to meet Helen at Financial District from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM. The travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Financial District is 21 minutes, so they leave at 5:50 PM, arrive at 6:11 PM. Helen is available until 6:30 PM, so they can meet from 6:11 to 6:41 PM.\n\nThen, after meeting Helen, they can go to Sunset District to meet Laura from 6:41 PM to 8:11 PM (90 minutes). But Laura's availability is until 9:15 PM, so they can extend the meeting. Wait, no, the meeting duration is fixed. So they meet Laura from 6:41 PM to 8:11 PM, but Laura needs 90 minutes. That works.\n\nThen, after meeting Laura, they can go to Alamo Square to meet Stephanie from 8:11 PM to 8:41 PM. But Stephanie is available until 4:30 PM, which is earlier. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, they need to meet Stephanie earlier.\n\nPerhaps after meeting David, they can go to Alamo Square from 11:15 AM to 11:35 AM, meet Stephanie from 11:35 AM to 12:05 PM, then go to Haight-Ashbury, Kimberly from 12:05 PM to 4:35 PM, then Lisa, Helen, Laura.\n\nBut that might reduce the number of meetings. Alternatively, maybe it's better to skip some to meet more.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Joshua and David, they can go to North Beach to meet Timothy from 7:45 PM to 10:00 PM. Travel time from Embarcadero to North Beach is 6 minutes, so they leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:21 AM. But Timothy is available from 7:45 PM to 10:00 PM. So they can't meet him until later.\n\nSo perhaps it's better to meet Timothy after meeting others. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Laura until 8:23 PM, they can go to North Beach from 8:23 PM to 8:29 PM (6 minutes). Then meet Timothy from 8:29 PM to 9:19 PM (90 minutes). Then go to Richmond District to meet Elizabeth from 9:19 PM to 10:34 PM (105 minutes). But Elizabeth is available from 7:00 PM to 8:45 PM. So they can't meet her after 8:45 PM. So maybe they can't meet both Timothy and Elizabeth.\n\nAlternatively, they can meet Elizabeth first. From Castro, go to Marina District to meet Elizabeth from 7:00 PM to 8:45 PM. Travel time is 22 minutes, so they leave at 9:00 AM, arrive at 9:22 AM. But Elizabeth is available from 7:00 PM to 8:45 PM. So they can meet her from 9:22 AM to 10:37 AM, but that's outside her availability. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the optimal schedule includes meeting the highest-priority people first, considering their duration and location accessibility.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to start with the earliest possible meetings that don't conflict and have the highest duration requirements, then fill in the gaps with others.\n\nSo, the user arrives at 9:00 AM. They can meet Ronald at Richmond District from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM. They arrive at 9:00 AM, so they can meet him until 9:30 AM. But Ronald needs 90 minutes, so they can only meet him for 30 minutes. That's not enough. So maybe they skip Ronald.\n\nNext, meet Joshua at Presidio from 8:30 AM. Travel time is 20 minutes, so arrive at 9:20 AM. Joshua needs 105 minutes, so meeting ends at 10:25 AM.\n\nThen, go to Embarcadero to meet David from 10:45 AM. Travel time is 20 minutes, arrive at 10:45 AM. Meet David for 30 minutes until 11:15 AM.\n\nAfter that, they can go to Haight-Ashbury to meet Kimberly from 4:45 PM. Travel time is 20 minutes from Embarcadero, so leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:35 AM. Kimberly is available until 9:30 PM, so meet her until 5:50 PM.\n\nThen, go to Golden Gate Park to meet Lisa from 5:30 PM. Travel time is 7 minutes, leave at 5:50 PM, arrive at 5:57 PM. Lisa is available until 9:45 PM, so meet her until 6:42 PM.\n\nNext, go to Sunset District to meet Laura from 5:45 PM. Travel time is 11 minutes, leave at 6:42 PM, arrive at 6:53 PM. Laura is available until 9:15 PM, so meet her until 8:23 PM.\n\nThen, go to Alamo Square to meet Stephanie from 3:30 PM. Travel time from Sunset District to Alamo Square is 16 minutes, so leave at 8:23 PM, arrive at 8:39 PM. But Stephanie is available until 4:30 PM, so can't meet her after that. So they need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Laura, they can go to Alamo Square earlier. Maybe after meeting Lisa, go to Alamo Square from 6:42 PM to 6:58 PM (16 minutes), arrive at 7:04 PM. But Stephanie is available until 4:30 PM, so that's too late.\n\nAlternatively, meet Stephanie earlier. After meeting David, go to Alamo Square from 11:15 AM to 11:35 AM, meet Stephanie until 12:05 PM. Then go to Haight-Ashbury, Kimberly from 12:05 PM to 4:35 PM. Then Lisa, Helen, Laura.\n\nThat way, they meet Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, Helen, Laura, and maybe others.\n\nBut they still need to meet Elizabeth, Timothy, etc.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the best approach is to write code that tries different orders and selects the one that maximizes the number of meetings.\n\nThe code should consider all possible orders, check if each meeting fits within the time windows, and select the best itinerary.\n\nSo, the code will generate all possible permutations of the meetings, check each permutation for feasibility, and keep track of the one with the most meetings.\n\nBut since there are 9 people, permutations are 9! = 362880, which is manageable.\n\nEach meeting has a start time and end time, considering travel times.\n\nThe code will:\n\n1. Define all meetings with their locations, start times, and durations.\n2. Generate all possible orders of meetings.\n3. For each order, check if the meetings can be scheduled without overlapping and respecting the time windows.\n4. Keep track of the order with the maximum number of meetings.\n5. Output the itinerary in JSON format.\n\nThis approach ensures that the optimal schedule is found by checking all possibilities.\n\nIn the code, I'll define the meetings, generate permutations, and for each permutation, simulate the schedule, adding travel times and checking against the constraints.\n\nFinally, the code will output the best itinerary as JSON.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create an optimal meeting schedule in San Francisco that allows meeting as many friends as possible while considering travel times and availability constraints. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings by efficiently traveling between locations and ensuring each meeting fits within the required time windows.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Meetings**: Prioritize meetings based on the duration required and the earliest possible start time. This helps in maximizing the number of meetings.\n2. **Travel Time Consideration**: Calculate the travel time between locations to ensure that each meeting starts on time and within the required duration.\n3. **Time Slot Management**: Schedule each meeting in a way that allows transitioning smoothly to the next without overlapping with the next person's availability.\n4. **Optimal Order**: Determine the order of meetings to minimize travel time and maximize the number of people met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define

optimal order to maximize the number of friends met while respecting travel times and availability constraints. The code calculates travel times between locations, checks for availability, and schedules meetings in a way that ensures each meeting starts on time and fits within the required duration. The final itinerary is converted to JSON format, ensuring all travel times and constraints are accounted for.",
