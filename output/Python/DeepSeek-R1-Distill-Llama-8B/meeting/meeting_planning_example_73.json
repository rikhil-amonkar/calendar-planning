            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to find the optimal meeting schedule in San Francisco. The user wants to meet as many friends as possible, but there are constraints on when each friend is available and how long each meeting needs to be. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the input data. There are travel times between different locations, and each friend has their own availability window and required meeting time. The user arrives at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM, so all meetings need to start from there or later.\n\nLooking at the constraints, Barbara is the only friend mentioned, and she's available from 7:15 AM to 10:00 PM at Pacific Heights. The user wants to meet her for at least 60 minutes. Since Barbara's availability starts before the user arrives, the earliest they can meet is at 9:00 AM. The meeting needs to last until at least 10:00 AM to meet the 60-minute requirement.\n\nNext, I need to model this as a scheduling problem. I think using a priority queue (min-heap) would be a good approach. This way, I can always consider the earliest possible meetings first, which helps in maximizing the number of meetings.\n\nI'll convert all times into minutes since midnight to make calculations easier. For example, 9:00 AM is 540 minutes, and 10:00 AM is 600 minutes. This will help in determining if a meeting can fit within the current time slot.\n\nI'll initialize the priority queue with Barbara's possible meeting times. Since she's available starting at 7:15 AM, but the user arrives at 9:00 AM, the earliest they can meet is at 9:00 AM. The meeting can last until 10:00 AM, which is 600 minutes. So, I'll push this meeting into the priority queue.\n\nThen, I'll use a while loop to process the priority queue. I'll extract the earliest meeting, check if it can be scheduled (i.e., starts after the current time and ends before Barbara's availability ends), and if so, add it to the schedule. After scheduling a meeting, I'll check for more possible meetings that can fit into the remaining time.\n\nIn this case, the only possible meeting is at 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM. After that, there are no more meetings possible because Barbara's next available time is already after the user's arrival, and no other friends are mentioned. So, the schedule will only include meeting Barbara once.\n\nFinally, I'll convert the schedule into the required JSON format, ensuring the times are in the correct 24-hour format without leading zeros. The output will be a JSON object with the itinerary list containing the meeting details.\n\nI think this approach covers all the constraints and efficiently finds the optimal meeting time. It uses a greedy algorithm to always pick the earliest feasible meeting, which should maximize the number of meetings possible.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef format_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    minutes = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\ndef to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + mins\n\n# Read travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    'Russian Hill': {\n        'Pacific Heights': 7,\n    },\n    'Pacific Heights': {\n        'Russian Hill': 7,\n    }\n}\n\n# Read people data and convert times to minutes\npeople = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Barbara',\n        'location': 'Pacific Heights',\n        'availability_start': '7:15',\n        'availability_end': '22:00',\n        'required_time': 60\n    }\n]\n\nfor person in people:\n    person['availability_start'] = to_minutes(person['availability_start'])\n    person['availability_end'] = to_minutes(person['availability_end'])\n\n# Initialize priority queue\npriority_queue = []\n\nfor person in people:\n    from_loc = 'Russian Hill'\n    to_loc = person['location']\n    arrival_time = 540 + travel_times[from_loc][to_loc]\n    avail_start = person['availability_start']\n    avail_end = person['availability_end']\n    required = person['required_time']\n    \n    earliest_start = max(arrival_time, avail_start)\n    latest_start = avail_end - required\n    \n    if earliest_start <= latest_start:\n        heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (earliest_start, earliest_start + required, person))\n\nschedule = []\ncurrent_end = 540  # 9:00 AM in minutes\n\nwhile priority_queue:\n    start_min, end_min, person = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n    \n    # Check if this meeting can be scheduled\n    if start_min >= current_end:\n        # Check if the meeting ends before the person's availability end\n        if end_min <= person['availability_end']:\n            # Add to schedule\n            schedule.append({\n                'action': 'meet',\n                'location': person['location'],\n                'person': person['name'],\n                'start_time': format_time(start_min),\n                'end_time': format_time(end_min)\n            })\n            current_end = end_min\n            \n            # Check for more possible meetings\n            for p in people:\n                from_loc = 'Russian Hill'\n                to_loc = p['location']\n                arrival_time = 540 + travel_times[from_loc][to_loc]\n                avail_start = p['availability_start']\n                avail_end = p['availability_end']\n                required = p['required_time']\n                \n                earliest_start = max(arrival_time, avail_start)\n                latest_start = avail_end - required\n                \n                if earliest_start <= latest_start:\n                    if earliest_start >= current_end:\n                        heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (earliest_start, earliest_start + required, p))\n    else:\n        # This meeting can't be scheduled now, put it back into the queue\n        heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (start_min, end_min, person))\n\n# Convert the schedule to the required format\nitinerary = []\nfor meeting in schedule:\n    location = meeting['location']\n    person = meeting['person']\n    start = meeting['start_time']\n    end = meeting['end_time']\n    itinerary.append({\n        'action': 'meet',\n        'location': location,\n        'person': person,\n        'start_time': start,\n        'end_time': end\n    })\n\n# Convert itinerary to JSON\nimport json\nprint(json.dumps({\n    \"itinerary\": itinerary\n}))\n```",
