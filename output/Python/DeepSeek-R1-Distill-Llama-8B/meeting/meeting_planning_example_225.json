The goal is to find the optimal meeting schedule for a day in San Francisco, considering travel times and the availability of friends. The user wants to maximize the number of meetings while respecting each person's constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input parameters. The travel distances are provided between various locations, which will be essential for calculating the time it takes to travel between these places. The constraints specify the arrival time at a location and the duration each person is available for a meeting.\n\nThe approach I'll use is a greedy algorithm with a priority queue (min-heap). This allows me to always consider the earliest possible meetings first, which helps in maximizing the number of meetings scheduled.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Convert Time Strings to Minutes**: To make time calculations easier, I'll convert all time strings to minutes since midnight.\n\n2. **Read Travel Times**: The travel times between locations are stored in a nested dictionary for easy access.\n\n3. **Initialize Priority Queue**: For each person, calculate the earliest possible start time for a meeting and add it to the priority queue if it fits within their availability window.\n\n4. **Scheduling Meetings**: Extract meetings from the priority queue, checking if they can be scheduled given the current time. If a meeting is scheduled, update the current end time and check for more feasible meetings that can be added to the queue.\n\n5. **Construct Itinerary**: After scheduling all possible meetings, construct the final itinerary in the required JSON format.\n\nI'll use Python's `heapq` module for the priority queue operations. The `format_time` function will convert minutes back to the \"H:MM\" format for the final output.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure:\n\n- **format_time**: Converts minutes to a formatted time string.\n- **to_minutes**: Converts a time string to minutes.\n- **travel_times**: Dictionary containing travel times between locations.\n- **people**: List of dictionaries, each representing a person's availability and required meeting time.\n- **Priority Queue Initialization**: For each person, calculate the earliest possible meeting time and add it to the queue.\n- **Scheduling Loop**: Process each meeting from the queue, checking if it can be scheduled based on the current time and the person's availability.\n- **Itinerary Construction**: Collect all scheduled meetings and convert them into the required JSON format.\n\nBy following this structured approach, I can ensure that the optimal meeting schedule is computed efficiently, considering all constraints and maximizing the number of meetings.",
