            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to write this Python program that helps me meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco. I've got these travel distances between different areas, and I need to schedule meetings based on everyone's availability. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings while respecting the travel times and each person's schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. I'm starting at North Beach at 9:00 AM, and I have several friends in different locations with specific time slots. I need to figure out the best times and places to meet them, considering how long it'll take me to travel between locations.\n\nLooking at the constraints, I see that Emily is at Union Square from 4:00 PM to 5:15 PM, and she wants a 45-minute meeting. Margaret is at Russian Hill from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, needing 120 minutes. So, I need to see if I can meet both of them without overlapping schedules and with enough travel time in between.\n\nI think the first step is to calculate the travel times from North Beach to each location. From the given data, North Beach to Union Square is 7 minutes, to Russian Hill is 4 minutes, and from Russian Hill back to North Beach is 5 minutes. Union Square to North Beach is 10 minutes, and Russian Hill to Union Square is 11 minutes.\n\nNext, I need to figure out the feasible meeting times for each person. For Emily, I can arrive at Union Square as early as 4:00 PM, but I have to leave by 5:15 PM. That gives me a 45-minute window. For Margaret, I need 120 minutes, so I can meet her as late as 7:00 PM, but her latest meeting ends at 9:00 PM.\n\nI should probably start by meeting Emily first since her time slot is earlier. It would take me 7 minutes to get to Union Square from North Beach. If I leave North Beach at 4:00 PM, I can meet her from 4:07 PM to 4:52 PM. That leaves me some time to travel to Russian Hill.\n\nFrom Union Square, it's 11 minutes to Russian Hill. If I leave Union Square at 4:52 PM, I can arrive at Russian Hill by 5:03 PM. But Margaret's earliest available time is 7:00 PM. That's a two-hour gap, which seems too long. Maybe I can find a better schedule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Margaret first. It takes 4 minutes to get to Russian Hill from North Beach, so I could leave at 9:04 AM and arrive by 9:04 AM. But Margaret isn't available until 7:00 PM. That's a long wait. Maybe that's not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I can meet Emily in the afternoon and Margaret in the evening. Let's see. If I meet Emily from 4:07 PM to 4:52 PM at Union Square, then I can go to Russian Hill, which takes 11 minutes, arriving at 5:03 PM. But Margaret is available from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. There's a 2-hour gap between 5:03 PM and 7:00 PM. I could potentially use that time for something else, but since I need to meet Margaret for 120 minutes, I might need to adjust.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize meeting Margaret since she needs a longer time. If I meet her from 7:00 PM to 8:20 PM at Russian Hill, I can travel back to North Beach, which takes 5 minutes, arriving at 8:25 PM. But I need to check if this conflicts with anything else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Emily in the late afternoon and Margaret in the evening, but I need to ensure that my travel times allow me to move between locations without overlapping meetings.\n\nI think the best approach is to calculate the feasible meeting times for each person, considering the travel times from North Beach, and then sort them by their end times to pick the earliest ending meetings first. This way, I can maximize the number of meetings.\n\nSo, for Emily, the latest I can arrive at Union Square is 5:15 PM, giving me a 45-minute meeting. For Margaret, I can meet her from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, which is a 120-minute meeting. \n\nI should also consider the travel time back to North Beach after each meeting. For example, after meeting Emily, I can leave Union Square at 5:15 PM and travel back, taking 10 minutes, arriving at 5:25 PM. Then, I can go to Russian Hill, which takes 4 minutes, arriving at 5:29 PM. But Margaret isn't available until 7:00 PM, so I have some time to spare.\n\nAlternatively, if I meet Margaret first, I can leave North Beach at 9:04 AM, but she isn't available until 7:00 PM. That's too early. So, it's better to meet Emily first in the afternoon.\n\nAfter meeting Emily, I can go to Russian Hill, but since Margaret's meeting starts at 7:00 PM, I have a few hours to kill. Maybe I can explore or take a break. Then, I can meet Margaret from 7:00 PM to 8:20 PM, which fits her availability.\n\nI also need to ensure that the travel times are accounted for. From Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes, so after meeting Margaret, I can return to North Beach by 8:25 PM.\n\nI think this schedule works. I meet Emily from 4:07 PM to 4:52 PM at Union Square and then Margaret from 7:00 PM to 8:20 PM at Russian Hill. This way, I'm maximizing my time and meeting both friends without overlapping schedules.\n\nI should also check if there are any other friends I can meet in between, but based on the given constraints, these are the only two. So, this seems like the optimal schedule for today.\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Define travel times from North Beach to each location\ntravel_times = {\n    'North Beach': {\n        'Union Square': 7,\n        'Russian Hill': 4\n    },\n    'Union Square': {\n        'North Beach': 10,\n        'Russian Hill': 11\n    },\n    'Russian Hill': {\n        'North Beach': 5,\n        'Union Square': 11\n    }\n}\n\n# List of people with their details\npeople = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Emily',\n        'location': 'Union Square',\n        'start_time': '4:00',\n        'end_time': '5:15',\n        'duration': 45,\n        'travel_time': 7\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Margaret',\n        'location': 'Russian Hill',\n        'start_time': '7:00',\n        'end_time': '9:00',\n        'duration': 120,\n        'travel_time': 4\n    }\n]\n\n# Function to calculate feasible meeting times\ndef calculate_feasible_meetings(people, travel_times):\n    meetings = []\n    for person in people:\n        location = person['location']\n        start_time = person['start_time']\n        end_time = person['end_time']\n        duration = person['duration']\n        travel_time = travel_times['North Beach'][location]\n        \n        # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n        earliest_start_min = (int(start_time.replace(':', '')) * 60) + 540  # 9:00 AM in minutes\n        latest_start_min = (int(end_time.replace(':', '')) * 60) - duration\n        \n        # Ensure earliest start is at least 9:00 AM\n        if earliest_start_min < 540:\n            earliest_start_min = 540\n        \n        if latest_start_min < earliest_start_min:\n            continue  # No possible meeting time\n        \n        meetings.append({\n            'name': person['name'],\n            'location': location,\n            'start_time': earliest_start_min,\n            'end_time': latest_start_min\n        })\n    \n    return meetings\n\n# Calculate feasible meeting times\nfeasible_meetings = calculate_feasible_meetings(people, travel_times)\n\n# Sort meetings by end time\nfeasible_meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x['end_time'])\n\n# Select non-overlapping meetings\nitinerary = []\nfor meeting in feasible_meetings:\n    start = meeting['start_time']\n    end = meeting['end_time']\n    if not itinerary or end <= itinerary[-1]['end_time']:\n        itinerary.append(meeting)\n\n# Convert time to 24-hour format strings\nitinerary = [\n    {\n        'action': 'meet',\n        'location': meeting['location'],\n        'person': meeting['name'],\n        'start_time': f\"{meeting['start_time'] // 60 + (meeting['start_time'] % 60 // 10)}:{meeting['start_time'] % 60 // 10 * 10}\",\n        'end_time': f\"{meeting['end_time'] // 60 + (meeting['end_time'] % 60 // 10)}:{meeting['end_time'] % 60 // 10 * 10}\"\n    }\n    for meeting in itinerary\n]\n\n# Generate JSON output\noutput = {\n    \"itinerary\": itinerary\n}\n\nprint(json.dumps(output))\n```",
