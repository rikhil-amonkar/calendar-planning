            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the optimal meeting schedule in San Francisco. The user has provided travel times between various locations and constraints for each person. My goal is to write a Python program that computes the best schedule using these constraints.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem deeply. The user arrives at The Castro at 9:00 AM and wants to meet as many friends as possible. Each friend has specific availability windows and required meeting times. I need to ensure that all travel times are considered and that the schedule respects each person's constraints.\n\nI remember that for such scheduling problems, a priority queue (min-heap) is a good approach. It allows me to always pick the earliest possible meeting first, which maximizes the number of meetings. So, I'll use a priority queue to manage the possible meeting times.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Convert the given travel times into a data structure that's easy to access. I'll create a nested dictionary where each location points to another location with the corresponding travel time.\n\n2. **Convert Time Strings to Minutes**: To make time calculations easier, I'll convert all time strings (like \"9:00 AM\") into minutes since midnight. This helps in comparing and calculating meeting times more straightforwardly.\n\n3. **Person Availability and Meeting Constraints**: Each person has a location they'll be at during specific times and the minimum meeting duration required. I'll store each person's data in a list of dictionaries, including their name, location, availability window, and required meeting time.\n\n4. **Priority Queue Initialization**: For each person, I'll calculate the earliest possible time they can meet based on their arrival time (from The Castro) and their availability window. If this earliest time allows for the required meeting duration, I'll add it to the priority queue.\n\n5. **Scheduling Meetings**: Using the priority queue, I'll extract the earliest possible meeting. If it fits within the current time and the person's availability, I'll schedule it, update the end time, and then check for more meetings that can be added, possibly reinserting them into the queue.\n\n6. **Construct Itinerary**: Once all possible meetings are scheduled, I'll construct the itinerary in the required JSON format, ensuring each meeting is recorded with the correct location, person, start, and end times.\n\nI also need to make sure that the times are formatted correctly in 24-hour format without leading zeros. For example, 9:00 AM is \"09:00\", but according to the rules, it should be \"9:00\". Wait, no, the rule says to use \"H:MM\" format without leading zeros, so \"9:00\" is correct.\n\nNow, let me think about potential issues. What if a person's availability window is before 9:00 AM? Since the user arrives at 9:00 AM, such meetings can't be scheduled. I need to ensure that the earliest possible start time is not before 9:00 AM.\n\nAnother consideration is the travel time from The Castro to each location. For each person, I need to calculate the arrival time at their location by adding the travel time from The Castro. Then, check if this arrival time fits within their availability window.\n\nI also need to handle cases where a meeting can't be scheduled due to the person's unavailability. In such cases, the meeting is skipped, and the person is reinserted into the priority queue for a later time if possible.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. The travel_times dictionary will map each location to another with the travel time. The people list will store each person's details, including their location, availability, and required time.\n\nFor the priority queue, each element will be a tuple containing the start time in minutes, the end time in minutes, and the person's data. The heap is ordered based on the start time, ensuring the earliest meetings are processed first.\n\nIn the scheduling loop, I'll extract the earliest meeting, check if it can be scheduled, and if so, add it to the itinerary and update the current end time. Then, for each person, I'll re-calculate their earliest possible meeting time and push it back into the queue if feasible.\n\nI also need to ensure that once a meeting is scheduled, the current end time is updated, and no overlapping meetings are scheduled. This way, the maximum number of meetings is achieved.\n\nFinally, after all possible meetings are processed, the itinerary is converted into the required JSON format and printed.\n\nI think this approach should work. Now, I'll proceed to write the Python code implementing this logic.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal meeting schedule for a day in San Francisco, considering travel times between locations and the availability of friends. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings while respecting each person's constraints.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using a priority queue (min-heap) to always consider the earliest possible meetings first. This greedy algorithm ensures that we maximize the number of meetings by scheduling the earliest feasible meetings as early as possible. Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Input Data Parsing**: Convert the given travel times into a structured format for easy access. Each location's travel time to another location is stored in a nested dictionary.\n\n2. **Convert Time Strings to Minutes**: To facilitate time calculations, convert all time strings to minutes since midnight.\n\n3. **Person Availability and Meeting Constraints**: Each person's availability window and required meeting time are stored in a list of dictionaries.\n\n4. **Priority Queue Initialization**: For each person, calculate the earliest possible start time for a meeting and add it to the priority queue if it fits within their availability window.\n\n5. **Scheduling Meetings**: Extract meetings from the priority queue, checking if they can be scheduled given the current time. If a meeting is scheduled, update the current end time and check for more feasible meetings that can be added to the queue.\n\n6. **Construct Itinerary**: After scheduling all possible meetings, construct the final itinerary in the required JSON format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef format_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    minutes = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\ndef to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + mins\n\n# Read travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    'The Castro':
