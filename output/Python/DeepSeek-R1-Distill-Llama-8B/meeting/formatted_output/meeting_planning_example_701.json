            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco during the day. The goal is to create an optimal meeting schedule based on the given constraints. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the people I need to meet and their availability:\n\n1. Lisa is at The Castro from 7:15PM to 9:15PM. I need at least 120 minutes with her.\n2. Daniel is at Nob Hill from 8:15AM to 11:00AM. I need at least 15 minutes.\n3. Elizabeth is at Presidio from 9:15PM to 10:15PM. Need 45 minutes.\n4. Steven is at Marina District from 4:30PM to 8:45PM. Need 90 minutes.\n5. Timothy is at Pacific Heights from 12:00PM to 6:00PM. Need 90 minutes.\n6. Ashley is at Golden Gate Park from 8:45PM to 9:45PM. Need 60 minutes.\n7. Kevin is at Chinatown from 12:00PM to 7:00PM. Need 30 minutes.\n8. Betty is at Richmond District from 1:15PM to 3:45PM. Need 30 minutes.\n\nI start at Mission District at 9:00AM. So my initial location is Mission District at time 9:00.\n\nI need to figure out the best way to meet each person, considering the travel times and the time each person is available. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings, so I should prioritize the ones that can be met with the least time constraints.\n\nLet me start by looking for the easiest meetings first. Daniel is available from 8:15AM to 11:00AM. Since I'm at Mission District at 9:00AM, I can go to Nob Hill where Daniel is. The travel time from Mission to Nob Hill is 12 minutes. So I can leave Mission at 9:00AM, arrive at 9:12AM. Since I need only 15 minutes, I can meet Daniel until 9:15AM. That's the earliest possible.\n\nNext, Betty is available from 1:15PM to 3:45PM. I need 30 minutes. Let's see when I can fit that in. After meeting Daniel, I have time until 11:00AM. Then I need to plan the rest of the day.\n\nLooking at the other people, Kevin is available from 12:00PM to 7:00PM. That's a long window, but I need at least 30 minutes. Maybe I can meet him later.\n\nTimothy is at Pacific Heights from 12:00PM to 6:00PM. Need 90 minutes. That's a good chunk of time. Let's see if I can fit that in.\n\nSteven is at Marina District from 4:30PM to 8:45PM. Need 90 minutes. That's a later slot.\n\nElizabeth is at Presidio from 9:15PM to 10:15PM. Need 45 minutes. That's late, but possible.\n\nLisa is at The Castro from 7:15PM to 9:15PM. Need 120 minutes. That's a long time, so I should plan for that.\n\nAshley is at Golden Gate Park from 8:45PM to 9:45PM. Need 60 minutes. That's also a bit later.\n\nNow, considering the travel times, I need to plan the order of meetings so that I can move efficiently between locations without missing anyone's availability.\n\nStarting at Mission District at 9:00AM, after meeting Daniel at Nob Hill from 9:00-9:15, I can then move to another location.\n\nLooking at the travel times from Nob Hill to other places:\n\n- Nob Hill to Presidio: 17 minutes\n- Nob Hill to Marina District: 11 minutes\n- Nob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes\n- Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park: 17 minutes\n- Nob Hill to Chinatown: 6 minutes\n- Nob Hill to Richmond District: 14 minutes\n\nI need to choose the next location. Let's consider meeting Kevin in Chinatown. Chinatown is 6 minutes from Nob Hill. Kevin is available from 12:00PM to 7:00PM. So if I leave Nob Hill at 9:15AM, it would take 6 minutes to get to Chinatown, arriving at 9:21AM. I can meet Kevin from 9:21AM to 9:51AM (30 minutes). That works.\n\nAfter meeting Kevin, I can then move to the next location. Let's see, from Chinatown, where to go next. The travel times from Chinatown to other places:\n\n- Chinatown to Mission District: 17 minutes\n- Chinatown to The Castro: 22\n- Chinatown to Nob Hill: 9\n- Chinatown to Presidio: 19\n- Chinatown to Marina District: 12\n- Chinatown to Pacific Heights: 10\n- Chinatown to Golden Gate Park: 23\n- Chinatown to Richmond District: 20\n\nI need to choose a place that allows me to meet someone else. Let's see, Timothy is at Pacific Heights until 6:00PM. If I go from Chinatown to Pacific Heights, that's 10 minutes. So leaving Chinatown at 9:51AM, arriving at 10:01AM. I need 90 minutes with Timothy, so I can meet him from 10:01AM to 4:11PM. That's a long time, but it fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet someone else earlier. Let's check other options.\n\nAfter meeting Kevin at 9:21-9:51, I can go to Pacific Heights via Chinatown, arriving at 10:01AM. Or maybe go to Marina District. From Chinatown to Marina District is 12 minutes. Marina District has Steven available from 4:30PM. If I go there at 10:01AM, I can't meet Steven until 4:30PM, which would require leaving after 9:51AM. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go to Marina District earlier. Wait, Steven is available from 4:30PM, so I can't meet him before then. So perhaps it's better to meet Timothy first.\n\nSo, meeting Timothy from 10:01AM to 4:11PM. Then, after that, I can move to Marina District to meet Steven. From Pacific Heights to Marina District is 6 minutes. So leaving Pacific Heights at 4:11PM, arriving at 4:17PM. Steven is available until 8:45PM. So I can meet him from 4:17PM to 7:17PM (90 minutes). That works.\n\nAfter meeting Steven, I can go to The Castro to meet Lisa. The Castro is 22 minutes from Marina District. So leaving Marina District at 7:17PM, arriving at 7:39PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM. So I can meet her from 7:39PM to 8:59PM (120 minutes). That's perfect.\n\nThen, from The Castro, I can go to Presidio to meet Elizabeth. The Castro to Presidio is 20 minutes. So leaving at 8:59PM, arriving at 9:19PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So I can meet her from 9:19PM to 10:04PM (45 minutes). That fits.\n\nAfter that, I can go to Golden Gate Park to meet Ashley. The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:04PM, arriving at 10:15PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM, but I arrive at 10:15PM, which is after her availability. So that's a problem. Maybe I need to adjust the schedule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should meet Ashley earlier. Let's see, Ashley is at Golden Gate Park from 8:45PM to 9:45PM. If I leave The Castro at 8:00PM, it would take 11 minutes to get there, arriving at 8:11PM. Then I can meet her until 9:41PM, but I need 60 minutes. So from 8:11PM to 9:11PM. That's 60 minutes. Then, I can still meet Elizabeth at Presidio from 9:15PM to 10:00PM.\n\nWait, but I have to meet Elizabeth for 45 minutes. Let me check the timings again.\n\nIf I meet Ashley at 8:11PM to 9:11PM, then I can go to Presidio from Golden Gate Park. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Presidio is 11 minutes. So leaving at 9:11PM, arriving at 9:22PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So I can meet her from 9:22PM to 10:07PM (45 minutes). That works.\n\nThen, after meeting Elizabeth, I can go to Richmond District to meet Betty. The Presidio to Richmond District is 7 minutes. So leaving at 10:07PM, arriving at 10:14PM. Betty is available until 3:45PM, but I arrive after her availability. So that's a problem. I can't meet Betty.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to adjust the order of meetings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Betty earlier. Let's see, Betty is at Richmond District from 1:15PM to 3:45PM. If I can get there before 3:45PM, I can meet her for 30 minutes.\n\nSo, after meeting Steven at 7:17-7:17+90=7:17PM-7:17+90=8:17PM? Wait, no. If I start at 4:17PM, I can meet Steven until 4:17+90=7:17PM. So I can leave Marina District at 7:17PM.\n\nThen, from Marina District, I can go to Golden Gate Park. The travel time is 16 minutes. So leaving at 7:17PM, arriving at 7:33PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM. So I can meet her from 7:33PM to 8:33PM (60 minutes). Then, from Golden Gate Park, go to Presidio. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 8:33PM, arriving at 8:44PM. Then, go to The Castro. Travel time from Presidio to The Castro is 20 minutes. So leaving at 8:44PM, arriving at 9:04PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM. So I can meet her from 9:04PM to 10:24PM (120 minutes). That works.\n\nThen, from The Castro, I can go to Presidio to meet Elizabeth. Travel time is 20 minutes. So leaving at 10:24PM, arriving at 10:44PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM, so I arrive after her. That's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Elizabeth earlier. Let me see.\n\nIf I meet Lisa from 9:04PM to 10:24PM, that's 120 minutes. Then, I can't meet Elizabeth, because her slot is before 9:15PM. So perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should meet Elizabeth before Lisa. Let me try that.\n\nAfter meeting Steven at 7:17-8:17PM, go to Presidio. Travel time from Marina District to Presidio is 11 minutes. So leaving at 8:17PM, arriving at 8:28PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So I can meet her from 8:28PM to 9:13PM (45 minutes). Then, go to Golden Gate Park. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 9:13PM, arriving at 9:24PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM. So I can meet her from 9:24PM to 10:24PM (60 minutes). Then, go to The Castro. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:24PM, arriving at 10:35PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM, so I can't meet her.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. I need to find a way to meet both Lisa and Elizabeth without overlapping.\n\nWait, maybe I can meet Elizabeth earlier. Let me try:\n\nAfter meeting Steven at 7:17-8:17PM, go to Presidio. Meet Elizabeth from 8:28-9:13PM. Then, go to The Castro. Travel time 20 minutes. So leaving at 9:13PM, arriving at 9:33PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM, so I arrive after her. Can't meet Lisa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go to The Castro earlier. From Presidio to The Castro is 20 minutes. If I leave Presidio at 8:00PM, arriving at 8:20PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM. So I can meet her from 8:20PM to 9:40PM (120 minutes). Then, go to Presidio again to meet Elizabeth. But that's not possible because I can't be in two places at once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Elizabeth after meeting Lisa.\n\nWait, let's try this:\n\nAfter meeting Steven at 7:17-8:17PM, go to The Castro. Travel time from Marina District is 22 minutes. So leaving at 8:17PM, arriving at 8:39PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM. So I can meet her from 8:39PM to 9:59PM (120 minutes). Then, go to Presidio. Travel time is 20 minutes. So leaving at 9:59PM, arriving at 10:19PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So I can meet her from 10:19PM, but she's already left. That's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Elizabeth at 9:15PM. But I need 45 minutes, so from 9:15PM to 10:00PM. But I'm meeting Lisa until 9:59PM. So I can't do that.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to adjust earlier meetings to allow more flexibility.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's see the constraints again.\n\nI have to meet Daniel at 9:00-9:15AM, Kevin at 9:21-9:51AM, Timothy at 10:01-4:11PM, Steven at 4:17-7:17PM, Lisa at 7:39-8:59PM, Elizabeth at 9:19-10:04PM, Ashley at 8:11-9:11PM, and Betty at 1:15-3:45PM.\n\nWait, but I can't meet both Ashley and Elizabeth and Lisa without overlapping.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize the longer meetings first. Lisa needs 120 minutes, which is the longest. So I should make sure to meet her as early as possible.\n\nSo, after meeting Steven at 7:17-8:17PM, go to The Castro. Meet Lisa from 8:39PM to 9:59PM. Then, go to Presidio to meet Elizabeth. Travel time is 20 minutes, so arriving at 10:19PM. But Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM, so I can't meet her.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go to Presidio earlier. From Marina District to Presidio is 11 minutes. So leaving at 7:17PM, arriving at 7:28PM. Then, go to The Castro. Travel time is 20 minutes, arriving at 7:48PM. Meet Lisa from 7:48PM to 9:28PM (120 minutes). Then, go to Presidio again? No, can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Lisa, go to Presidio. From The Castro to Presidio is 20 minutes. So leaving at 9:28PM, arriving at 9:48PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So I can meet her from 9:48PM to 10:33PM (45 minutes). Then, go to Golden Gate Park. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:33PM, arriving at 10:44PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM, so I can't meet her.\n\nThis way, I can meet Lisa and Elizabeth, but not Ashley.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Ashley earlier. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Steven at 7:17-8:17PM, go to Golden Gate Park. Travel time from Marina District is 16 minutes. So leaving at 8:17PM, arriving at 8:33PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM. So I can meet her from 8:33PM to 9:33PM (60 minutes). Then, go to Presidio. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 9:33PM, arriving at 9:44PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So I can meet her from 9:44PM to 10:29PM (45 minutes). Then, go to The Castro. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:29PM, arriving at 10:40PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM, so I can't meet her.\n\nThis way, I can meet Ashley and Elizabeth, but not Lisa.\n\nIt seems like I have to choose between meeting Lisa and Ashley/Elizabeth. Since Lisa needs 120 minutes, which is a longer meeting, maybe it's better to prioritize her.\n\nSo, I'll plan to meet Lisa last, ensuring I have enough time.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. Start at Mission District at 9:00AM.\n2. Meet Daniel at Nob Hill from 9:00-9:15AM.\n3. Travel to Chinatown, arrive at 9:12AM. Wait, no, the travel time from Mission to Nob Hill is 12 minutes, so I arrive at 9:12AM. Wait, no, the initial plan was to leave Mission at 9:00AM, arrive at Nob Hill at 9:12AM. Then, leave at 9:12AM to go to Chinatown, which is 7 minutes away. So arrive at 9:19AM. Wait, no, the travel time from Nob Hill to Chinatown is 6 minutes, so leaving at 9:12AM, arriving at 9:18AM. Then, meet Kevin from 9:18-9:48AM.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the travel times.\n\nFrom Mission District to Nob Hill is 12 minutes. So leaving Mission at 9:00AM, arrive at 9:12AM. Then, from Nob Hill to Chinatown is 6 minutes. So leave at 9:12AM, arrive at 9:18AM. Meet Kevin from 9:18-9:48AM.\n\nThen, from Chinatown, where to go next? Let's go to Pacific Heights via Chinatown. Travel time is 10 minutes. So leaving at 9:48AM, arrive at 10:00AM. Meet Timothy from 10:00AM to 4:10PM (90 minutes). That works.\n\nAfter Timothy, I can go to Marina District. From Pacific Heights to Marina District is 6 minutes. So leaving at 4:10PM, arrive at 4:16PM. Steven is available until 8:45PM. So I can meet him from 4:16PM to 7:16PM (90 minutes).\n\nThen, from Marina District, go to The Castro. Travel time is 22 minutes. So leaving at 7:16PM, arrive at 7:38PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM. So I can meet her from 7:38PM to 8:58PM (120 minutes).\n\nThen, go to Presidio. Travel time is 20 minutes. So leaving at 8:58PM, arrive at 9:18PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So meet her from 9:18PM to 10:03PM (45 minutes).\n\nAfter that, go to Golden Gate Park. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:03PM, arrive at 10:14PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM, so I can't meet her.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go to Golden Gate Park earlier. From Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. So leaving at 9:18PM, arrive at 9:29PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM. So meet her from 9:29PM to 10:29PM (60 minutes). Then, go to The Castro. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:29PM, arrive at 10:40PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM, so can't meet her.\n\nThis way, I can meet Ashley, Elizabeth, and Lisa, but not both at the same time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Ashley earlier.\n\nWait, let's try this:\n\nAfter meeting Steven at 7:16-7:16+90=7:16-8:16PM, go to Golden Gate Park. Travel time is 16 minutes from Marina District. So leaving at 8:16PM, arrive at 8:32PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM. So meet her from 8:32PM to 9:32PM (60 minutes). Then, go to Presidio. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 9:32PM, arrive at 9:43PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So meet her from 9:43PM to 10:28PM (45 minutes). Then, go to The Castro. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:28PM, arrive at 10:39PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM, so can't meet her.\n\nThis way, I can meet Ashley and Elizabeth, but not Lisa.\n\nIt's a tough choice. Since Lisa needs 120 minutes, which is a longer meeting, maybe it's better to prioritize her.\n\nSo, let's stick with the plan where I meet Lisa last.\n\nFinal plan:\n\n1. Start at Mission District at 9:00AM.\n2. Meet Daniel at Nob Hill from 9:00-9:15AM.\n3. Travel to Chinatown, meet Kevin from 9:18-9:48AM.\n4. Travel to Pacific Heights, meet Timothy from 10:00-4:10PM.\n5. Travel to Marina District, meet Steven from 4:16-7:16PM.\n6. Travel to The Castro, meet Lisa from 7:38-8:58PM.\n7. Travel to Presidio, meet Elizabeth from 9:18-10:03PM.\n8. Can't meet Ashley or Betty due to time constraints.\n\nWait, but I can't meet Ashley because I arrive at Presidio at 9:18PM, and she's available until 9:45PM. So I can meet her if I adjust.\n\nLet me adjust step 7 and 8:\n\nAfter meeting Lisa at 8:58PM, go to Presidio. Travel time is 20 minutes, arriving at 9:18PM. Now, I can meet Elizabeth from 9:18-10:03PM (45 minutes). Then, go to Golden Gate Park. Travel time is 11 minutes, arriving at 9:29PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM. So I can meet her from 9:29-9:29+60=9:29-10:29PM, but she's only available until 9:45PM. So I can meet her from 9:29-9:45PM (36 minutes), but I need 60 minutes. That's not enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go to Golden Gate Park earlier.\n\nFrom Marina District to Golden Gate Park is 16 minutes. So leaving at 7:16PM, arrive at 7:32PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM. So meet her from 7:32-8:32PM (60 minutes). Then, go to The Castro. Travel time is 16 minutes. So leaving at 8:32PM, arrive at 8:48PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM. So I can meet her from 8:48-9:08PM (20 minutes), but I need 120 minutes. That's not enough.\n\nAlternatively, leave Marina District later. After meeting Steven at 7:16-8:16PM, go to Golden Gate Park. Meet Ashley from 8:16-9:16PM. Then, go to Presidio. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 9:16PM, arrive at 9:27PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So meet her from 9:27-10:12PM (45 minutes). Then, go to The Castro. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:12PM, arrive at 10:23PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM, so can't meet her.\n\nThis way, I can meet Ashley and Elizabeth, but not Lisa.\n\nIt seems that I have to choose between meeting Lisa and Ashley/Elizabeth. Since Lisa needs 120 minutes, which is a longer meeting, it's better to prioritize her.\n\nSo, the final schedule will include meeting Lisa, Elizabeth, Steven, Timothy, Daniel, and Kevin, but not Ashley or Betty.\n\nWait, but the problem says to meet as many as possible. So maybe I can find a way to meet Ashley as well.\n\nLet me try this:\n\nAfter meeting Steven at 7:16-8:16PM, go to Golden Gate Park. Travel time is 16 minutes. So leaving at 8:16PM, arrive at 8:32PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM. So meet her from 8:32-9:32PM (60 minutes). Then, go to Presidio. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 9:32PM, arrive at 9:43PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So meet her from 9:43-10:28PM (45 minutes). Then, go to The Castro. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:28PM, arrive at 10:39PM. Lisa is available until 9:15PM, so can't meet her.\n\nThis way, I can meet Ashley and Elizabeth, but not Lisa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Lisa earlier.\n\nWait, if I leave The Castro at 8:00PM, I can meet Lisa from 8:00-9:20PM (120 minutes). Then, go to Presidio. Travel time is 20 minutes. So arriving at 9:20PM. Elizabeth is available until 10:15PM. So meet her from 9:20-10:05PM (45 minutes). Then, go to Golden Gate Park. Travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:05PM, arrive at 10:16PM. Ashley is available until 9:45PM, so can't meet her.\n\nThis way, I can meet Lisa and Elizabeth, but not Ashley.\n\nIt's a tough balance. Maybe the optimal schedule includes meeting the most people, even if it means missing one.\n\nSo, the final plan includes:\n\n- Daniel, Kevin, Timothy, Steven, Lisa, and Elizabeth.\n\nBut I can't meet Ashley or Betty.\n\nWait, but I have to make sure all travel times are accounted for.\n\nLet me outline the steps again with the final plan:\n\n1. 9:00AM: Start at Mission District.\n2. 9:00-9:15AM: Meet Daniel at Nob Hill.\n3. 9:15AM: Travel to Chinatown (6 minutes), arrive at 9:21AM.\n4. 9:21-9:51AM: Meet Kevin.\n5. 9:51AM: Travel to Pacific Heights (10 minutes), arrive at 10:01AM.\n6. 10:01AM-4:11PM: Meet Timothy.\n7. 4:11PM: Travel to Marina District (6 minutes), arrive at 4:17PM.\n8. 4:17PM-7:17PM: Meet Steven.\n9. 7:17PM: Travel to The Castro (22 minutes), arrive at 7:39PM.\n10. 7:39PM-8:59PM: Meet Lisa.\n11. 8:59PM: Travel to Presidio (20 minutes), arrive at 9:19PM.\n12. 9:19PM-10:04PM: Meet Elizabeth.\n13. Can't meet Ashley or Betty due to time constraints.\n\nThis seems to be the optimal schedule, meeting as many people as possible with the given constraints.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create an optimal meeting schedule in San Francisco that allows meeting as many friends as possible while considering travel times and availability constraints. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings by efficiently traveling between locations and ensuring each meeting fits within the required time windows.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Meetings**: Prioritize meetings based on the duration required and the earliest possible start time. This helps in maximizing the number of meetings.\n2. **Travel Time Consideration**: Calculate the travel time between locations to ensure that each meeting starts on time and within the required duration.\n3. **Time Slot Management**: Schedule each meeting in a way that allows transitioning smoothly to the next without overlapping with the next person's availability.\n4. **Optimal Order**: Determine the order of meetings to minimize travel time and maximize the number of people met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Define the travel times as a dictionary\ntravel_times = {\n    # From
