            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to schedule meetings with seven friends in San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and each friend's availability. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input parameters. The travel times are provided between various locations like Russian Hill, Presidio, Chinatown, Pacific Heights, Richmond District, Fisherman's Wharf, and Golden Gate Park. Each friend has specific time slots and minimum meeting durations.\n\nI arrive at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM. The friends' availability is:\n\n- **Matthew**: Presidio from 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n- **Margaret**: Chinatown from 9:15 AM to 6:45 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n- **Nancy**: Pacific Heights from 2:15 PM to 5:00 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n- **Helen**: Richmond District from 7:45 PM to 10:00 PM, needs 60 minutes.\n- **Rebecca**: Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15 PM to 10:15 PM, needs 60 minutes.\n- **Kimberly**: Golden Gate Park from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM, needs 120 minutes.\n- **Kenneth**: Bayview from 2:30 PM to 6:00 PM, needs 60 minutes.\n\nI need to create a schedule that includes as many of these meetings as possible without overlapping and considering travel times.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: Each friend has specific availability and minimum meeting duration.\n2. **Calculate Travel Times**: Use the provided distances to determine the time needed to travel between locations.\n3. **Generate Possible Meetings**: For each friend, determine possible meeting times that fit within their availability and travel time from the starting location.\n4. **Schedule Meetings**: Prioritize scheduling the earliest possible meetings to maximize the number of meetings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    #
