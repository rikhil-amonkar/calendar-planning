            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to schedule meetings with several friends in San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many as possible, considering the constraints of each person's availability and the travel times between locations. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the people I need to meet and their availability:\n\n1. Elizabeth is available from 10:30 AM to 8:00 PM. I need at least 90 minutes with her.\n2. David is available from 3:15 PM to 7:00 PM. Need 45 minutes.\n3. Sandra is available all day from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM. Need 120 minutes.\n4. Thomas is available from 7:30 PM to 8:30 PM. Need 30 minutes.\n5. Robert is available from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Need 15 minutes.\n6. Kenneth is available from 10:45 AM to 1:00 PM. Need 45 minutes.\n7. Melissa is available from 6:15 PM to 8:00 PM. Need 15 minutes.\n8. Kimberly is available from 10:15 AM to 6:15 PM. Need 105 minutes.\n9. Amanda is available from 7:45 AM to 6:45 PM. Need 15 minutes.\n\nI start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. So my first move is to figure out where to meet each person, considering the travel times and the time I have available.\n\nI think the best approach is to prioritize the people who can be met earlier and require less time, or who have overlapping availability with others. Sandra needs 120 minutes, which is the longest, so maybe I should meet her as early as possible to maximize the time left for others.\n\nLooking at Sandra's availability, she's at Pacific Heights from 7:00 AM. If I leave Haight-Ashbury at 7:00 AM, it's a 12-minute walk. So I can arrive at 7:12 AM. But wait, I arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM, so I can't leave before that. So I need to plan the meetings starting from 9:00 AM.\n\nWait, no. The constraints are that I arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. So I can leave Haight-Ashbury any time from 9:00 AM onwards, but each meeting requires me to travel to their location and spend time there. So I need to consider the time I leave Haight-Ashbury and the time I arrive at each location, ensuring that the meeting duration fits within their availability.\n\nLet me think about the possible order. Maybe start with Sandra since she's available all day and needs a long time. But I need to check if I can meet her early enough to fit other meetings later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet someone who is available early and can be met quickly, like Robert, who's available from 10:00 AM. If I leave Haight-Ashbury at 10:00 AM, it's a 23-minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf. Then I can meet Robert for 15 minutes, ending at 10:15 AM. That's a quick meeting.\n\nAfter that, perhaps Kenneth, who's available from 10:45 AM. Kenneth is at Marina District from 10:45 AM. So if I leave Fisherman's Wharf at 10:15 AM, it's a 9-minute walk to Marina District. That would get me there by 10:24 AM. Wait, no, the travel time is from Fisherman's Wharf to Marina District is 9 minutes. So leaving at 10:15 AM, arriving at 10:24 AM. But Kenneth is available starting at 10:45 AM. So I can't meet him before 10:45 AM. So perhaps I should leave Haight-Ashbury later.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all possible meeting times and see which combination fits best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model this as a graph where each node is a possible location and time, and edges represent possible meetings. But that might be too complex.\n\nAnother approach is to sort the people by the time they become available and the duration they need, trying to fit as many as possible.\n\nLet me consider the earliest possible times:\n\n- Elizabeth is available from 10:30 AM. Needs 90 minutes.\n- Robert is available from 10:00 AM. Needs 15 minutes.\n- Kenneth is available from 10:45 AM. Needs 45 minutes.\n- Sandra is available from 7:00 AM. Needs 120 minutes.\n- Amanda is available from 7:45 AM. Needs 15 minutes.\n- David from 3:15 PM. Needs 45 minutes.\n- Thomas from 7:30 PM. Needs 30 minutes.\n- Melissa from 6:15 PM. Needs 15 minutes.\n- Kimberly from 10:15 AM. Needs 105 minutes.\n\nI need to start at 9:00 AM, so I can't meet anyone before that.\n\nLet me think about meeting Sandra first. She's available from 7:00 AM, but I can't get to her before 9:00 AM. The travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights is 12 minutes. So if I leave at 9:00 AM, I arrive at 9:12 AM. Sandra is available until 8:00 PM, so that's a long time. I need 120 minutes, so I can meet her from 9:12 AM to 11:12 AM. That leaves the rest of the day for other meetings.\n\nAfter Sandra, perhaps the next best is Elizabeth. She's available from 10:30 AM. So I need to leave Haight-Ashbury by 10:30 AM minus travel time. Wait, no. I have to leave Haight-Ashbury, travel to her location, and arrive before her availability starts.\n\nWait, let's clarify. For each meeting, I need to:\n\n1. Leave Haight-Ashbury at time T.\n2. Travel to location L, taking D minutes.\n3. Arrive at L at T + D.\n4. Meet for M minutes, ending at T + D + M.\n5. Ensure that T + D is before the person's start time, and T + D + M is within their end time.\n\nSo for Sandra, if I leave Haight-Ashbury at T, travel to Pacific Heights in 12 minutes, arrive at 9:12 AM. Sandra is available from 7:00 AM, so that's fine. I can meet her from 9:12 AM to 11:12 AM, which is 120 minutes. So that works.\n\nThen, after Sandra, I can go to another location. Let's see who else is available.\n\nLooking at the next available times:\n\n- Robert is available until 3:00 PM.\n- Kenneth is available from 10:45 AM.\n- Elizabeth is available from 10:30 AM.\n- Amanda is available from 7:45 AM.\n- Kimberly is available from 10:15 AM.\n- David from 3:15 PM.\n- Thomas from 7:30 PM.\n- Melissa from 6:15 PM.\n- Sandra is done at 8:00 PM.\n\nSo after Sandra, perhaps I can meet Amanda. She's available from 7:45 AM. So if I leave Pacific Heights at, say, 11:12 AM, I can go to Golden Gate Park. The travel time is 10 minutes from Pacific Heights to Golden Gate Park. Arriving at 11:22 AM. Amanda is available until 6:45 PM, so that's fine. I can meet her for 15 minutes, ending at 11:37 AM.\n\nThen, perhaps meet Elizabeth. She's available from 10:30 AM. So I can leave Golden Gate Park at 11:37 AM, travel to Mission District. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Mission District is 17 minutes. Arriving at 11:54 AM. Elizabeth is available until 8:00 PM, so I can meet her for 90 minutes, ending at 12:24 PM.\n\nWait, but 11:54 AM is after her start time of 10:30 AM, so that's fine.\n\nAfter Elizabeth, perhaps Kenneth. He's available from 10:45 AM. So if I leave Mission District at 12:24 PM, travel to Marina District, which is 20 minutes. Arriving at 12:44 PM. Kenneth is available until 1:00 PM, so I can meet him for 45 minutes, ending at 12:44 + 45 = 12:29 PM? Wait, no, adding 45 minutes to 12:44 PM would be 1:29 PM, but he's available until 1:00 PM. So that's a problem. So I can't meet him that late.\n\nAlternatively, maybe leave earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf I meet Elizabeth from 11:54 AM to 12:24 PM, then I can leave Mission District at 12:24 PM. Kenneth is available until 1:00 PM. The travel time to Marina District is 20 minutes, so arriving at 12:44 PM. That's within his availability. So I can meet him from 12:44 PM to 1:29 PM. But his end time is 1:00 PM, so that's too long. So I can only meet him for 16 minutes. That's not enough, as he needs 45 minutes.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So maybe I need to adjust the schedule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meet Kenneth earlier. If I leave Haight-Ashbury earlier. Let's see.\n\nAfter Sandra, maybe go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Robert. He's available from 10:00 AM. So if I leave Pacific Heights at, say, 10:00 AM, travel to Fisherman's Wharf in 23 minutes, arriving at 10:23 AM. Robert is available until 3:00 PM, so I can meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:38 AM.\n\nThen, perhaps go to Marina District to meet Kenneth. Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Marina District is 9 minutes, arriving at 10:32 AM. Kenneth is available from 10:45 AM, so I can't meet him before 10:45 AM. So perhaps leave Fisherman's Wharf at 10:38 AM, arrive at Marina District at 10:47 AM. Then meet Kenneth from 10:47 AM to 11:32 AM (45 minutes). That works.\n\nThen, after Kenneth, go to Mission District to meet Elizabeth. Travel time from Marina District to Mission District is 20 minutes, arriving at 11:07 AM. Elizabeth is available from 10:30 AM, so that's fine. Meet her for 90 minutes, ending at 11:07 + 90 = 11:57 AM.\n\nThen, after Elizabeth, perhaps go to Golden Gate Park to meet Amanda. Travel time from Mission District to Golden Gate Park is 17 minutes, arriving at 11:24 AM. Amanda is available until 6:45 PM. Meet her for 15 minutes, ending at 11:39 AM.\n\nThen, perhaps go to Sunset District to meet Kimberly. Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Sunset District is 11 minutes, arriving at 11:50 AM. Kimberly is available from 10:15 AM, so that's fine. She needs 105 minutes. So if I leave at 11:50 AM, I can meet her until 12:35 PM. But I need to check if I can fit other meetings after that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Amanda, meet someone else.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should create a list of possible meetings with their constraints and see which combination fits best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a backtracking approach, but that might be too time-consuming for a Python program.\n\nWait, the problem says to write a Python program that computes the optimal schedule. So I need to model this as an algorithm.\n\nI think the best approach is to model each possible meeting as a node, considering the time constraints and travel times, and then select the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings that can be scheduled.\n\nBut since this is a programming problem, I need to write code that can compute this.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each person, determine the possible time slots when I can meet them, considering my travel time to their location and their availability.\n\n2. Then, select a subset of these meetings that do not overlap in time, maximizing the number of people met.\n\n3. Among all possible subsets, choose the one that meets the most people, or the longest total time, etc.\n\nBut this might be computationally intensive, but given the small number of people, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since the constraints are fixed, perhaps the optimal schedule can be found by selecting the earliest possible meetings that don't conflict.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, I'll create a list of people with their location, available time window, required duration, and the travel time from Haight-Ashbury to their location.\n\nThen, for each person, compute the possible meeting times.\n\nFor each person, the meeting can start at any time T such that:\n\nT + travel_time <= person_start_time\n\nand\n\nT + travel_time + required_duration <= person_end_time\n\nAlso, I start at 9:00 AM, so T must be >= 9:00 AM.\n\nSo for each person, the latest I can start meeting them is person_start_time - travel_time.\n\nIf that's earlier than 9:00 AM, then it's not possible to meet them.\n\nSo first, for each person, compute their possible meeting window.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to selecting a subset of these windows that do not overlap, and maximize the number of people met.\n\nThis is similar to the interval scheduling problem, where the goal is to select the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals.\n\nIn the interval scheduling problem, the optimal approach is to sort the intervals by their end times and then select the earliest ending interval, then the next compatible one, etc.\n\nSo perhaps I can apply a similar approach here.\n\nLet me list each person with their possible meeting window.\n\nStarting with Sandra:\n\nSandra: Pacific Heights, available 7:00-8:00 PM. Needs 120 minutes.\n\nTravel time from Haight-Ashbury is 12 minutes.\n\nSo latest start time is 8:00 PM - 12 minutes = 7:48 PM.\n\nBut I can't start before 9:00 AM, so her meeting must be between 9:00 AM and 7:48 PM, with a duration of 120 minutes.\n\nSo her meeting can start as early as 9:00 AM, ending at 11:00 AM, but that's only 120 minutes. Wait, 9:00 AM + 120 minutes is 11:00 AM. So she can be met from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM.\n\nWait, no. If I start at 9:00 AM, I arrive at her location at 9:12 AM, then meet for 120 minutes until 11:12 AM. So the meeting ends at 11:12 AM.\n\nSo her window is from 9:00 AM to 11:12 AM.\n\nNext, Amanda: Golden Gate Park, available 7:45 AM to 6:45 PM. Needs 15 minutes.\n\nTravel time is 7 minutes from Haight-Ashbury.\n\nSo latest start time is 6:45 PM - 7 minutes = 6:38 PM.\n\nBut she's available until 6:45 PM, so latest start is 6:45 PM - 7 minutes = 6:38 PM.\n\nBut she's also available from 7:45 AM. So her meeting can be from 7:45 AM to 6:38 PM, but considering the travel time.\n\nWait, no. To meet her, I need to leave Haight-Ashbury at T, travel for 7 minutes, arrive at T+7, meet for 15 minutes, ending at T+7+15=T+22.\n\nSo T+22 <= 6:45 PM.\n\nSo T <= 6:23 PM.\n\nAlso, T must be >= 9:00 AM.\n\nSo her possible meeting times are from 9:00 AM to 6:23 PM.\n\nSimilarly, for each person, compute their possible meeting window.\n\nLet me create a list of all people with their possible meeting windows:\n\n1. Sandra: 9:00 AM - 11:12 AM (120 mins)\n2. Amanda: 9:00 AM - 6:23 PM (7h23m, 15 mins)\n3. Elizabeth: available 10:30 AM - 8:00 PM. Needs 90 mins. Travel time to Mission District is 17 mins.\n\nSo latest start time is 8:00 PM - 17 = 7:43 PM.\n\nBut she's available from 10:30 AM, so her meeting can be from 10:30 AM to 7:43 PM, but I can't start before 9:00 AM.\n\nWait, no. To meet Elizabeth, I need to leave Haight-Ashbury at T, arrive at Mission District at T+17, and meet from T+17 to T+17+90 = T+107.\n\nThis must be within her availability: 10:30 AM <= T+17 and T+107 <= 8:00 PM.\n\nSo T >= 10:30 AM - 17 mins = 10:13 AM.\n\nT <= 8:00 PM - 107 mins = 7:53 PM.\n\nBut I can't start before 9:00 AM, so T must be >=9:00 AM and <=7:53 PM.\n\nBut 10:13 AM is later than 9:00 AM, so her earliest possible start is 10:13 AM.\n\nSo her meeting can be from 10:13 AM to 7:53 PM, but considering the duration, it's 90 minutes, so the meeting ends at 10:13 + 90 = 7:53 PM.\n\nSo her window is 10:13 AM - 7:53 PM.\n\n4. Kenneth: Marina District, available 10:45 AM - 1:00 PM. Needs 45 mins. Travel time 20 mins.\n\nSo latest start time is 1:00 PM - 20 = 12:40 PM.\n\nBut he's available from 10:45 AM, so T must be >=10:45 AM - 20 = 10:25 AM.\n\nBut I can't start before 9:00 AM, so T >=9:00 AM.\n\nSo his meeting can be from 9:00 AM to 12:40 PM, but considering the duration.\n\nWait, T + 20 +45 <=1:00 PM.\n\nSo T <=1:00 PM -65=12:35 PM.\n\nBut he's available until 1:00 PM, so T can be up to 12:35 PM.\n\nSo his meeting window is from 9:00 AM to 12:35 PM.\n\n5. Robert: Fisherman's Wharf, available 10:00 AM -3:00 PM. Needs 15 mins. Travel time 23 mins.\n\nSo latest start time is 3:00 PM -23=2:37 PM.\n\nBut he's available from 10:00 AM, so T >=10:00 AM -23=9:37 AM.\n\nBut I can't start before 9:00 AM, so T >=9:00 AM.\n\nSo his meeting can be from 9:00 AM to 2:37 PM.\n\n6. David: Union Square, available 3:15 PM -7:00 PM. Needs 45 mins. Travel time 19 mins.\n\nSo latest start time is 7:00 PM -19=6:41 PM.\n\nBut he's available from 3:15 PM, so T >=3:15 PM -19=2:56 PM.\n\nBut I can't start before 9:00 AM, so T >=9:00 AM.\n\nSo his meeting can be from 9:00 AM to 6:41 PM.\n\n7. Thomas: Bayview, available 7:30 PM -8:30 PM. Needs 30 mins. Travel time 18 mins.\n\nSo latest start time is 8:30 PM -18=8:12 PM.\n\nHe's available from 7:30 PM, so T >=7:30 PM -18=6:42 PM.\n\nBut I can't start before 9:00 AM, so T >=9:00 AM.\n\nSo his meeting can be from 9:00 AM to 8:12 PM.\n\n8. Melissa: Richmond District, available 6:15 PM -8:00 PM. Needs 15 mins. Travel time 12 mins.\n\nSo latest start time is 8:00 PM -12=7:48 PM.\n\nShe's available from 6:15 PM, so T >=6:15 PM -12=5:03 PM.\n\nBut I can't start before 9:00 AM, so T >=9:00 AM.\n\nSo her meeting can be from 9:00 AM to 7:48 PM.\n\n9. Kimberly: Sunset District, available 10:15 AM -6:15 PM. Needs 105 mins. Travel time 15 mins.\n\nSo latest start time is 6:15 PM -15=5:00 PM.\n\nShe's available from 10:15 AM, so T >=10:15 AM -15=10:00 AM.\n\nBut I can't start before 9:00 AM, so T >=9:00 AM.\n\nSo her meeting can be from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\n\nNow, I need to select a subset of these people's meeting windows such that none of the meetings overlap, and maximize the number of people met.\n\nThis is similar to the interval scheduling problem where the goal is to select the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals.\n\nThe optimal approach is to sort the intervals by their end times and then select the earliest ending interval, then the next compatible one, etc.\n\nSo let's list all possible meetings with their start and end times.\n\nLet me list each person's possible meeting window:\n\n1. Sandra: 9:00 AM -11:12 AM\n2. Amanda: 9:00 AM -6:23 PM\n3. Elizabeth: 10:13 AM -7:53 PM\n4. Kenneth: 9:00 AM -12:35 PM\n5. Robert: 9:00 AM -2:37 PM\n6. David: 9:00 AM -6:41 PM\n7. Thomas: 9:00 AM -8:12 PM\n8. Melissa: 9:00 AM -7:48 PM\n9. Kimberly: 9:00 AM -5:00 PM\n\nNow, I need to select as many as possible without overlapping.\n\nLet's sort them by end time:\n\n1. Sandra: 11:12 AM\n2. Kenneth: 12:35 PM\n3. Robert: 2:37 PM\n4. David: 6:41 PM\n5. Elizabeth: 7:53 PM\n6. Thomas: 8:12 PM\n7. Melissa: 7:48 PM\n8. Amanda: 6:23 PM\n9. Kimberly: 5:00 PM\n\nWait, but some of these end times are earlier than others. So the order would be:\n\n- Sandra ends earliest at 11:12 AM.\n- Kenneth at 12:35 PM.\n- Robert at 2:37 PM.\n- Kimberly at 5:00 PM.\n- Amanda at 6:23 PM.\n- David at 6:41 PM.\n- Melissa at 7:48 PM.\n- Elizabeth at 7:53 PM.\n- Thomas at 8:12 PM.\n\nSo the order is Sandra, Kenneth, Robert, Kimberly, Amanda, David, Melissa, Elizabeth, Thomas.\n\nNow, let's try to pick the earliest ending and see how many can be scheduled.\n\n1. Pick Sandra: 9:00 AM -11:12 AM.\n\nNext, pick the next earliest ending, which is Kenneth at 12:35 PM.\n\nCheck if 12:35 PM is after Sandra's end time (11:12 AM). Yes, so no overlap.\n\nSo now we have Sandra and Kenneth.\n\nNext, pick Robert at 2:37 PM. After Kenneth's end time (12:35 PM). So no overlap.\n\nNow, pick Kimberly at 5:00 PM. After Robert's end time (2:37 PM). So no overlap.\n\nNext, pick Amanda at 6:23 PM. After Kimberly's end time (5:00 PM). So no overlap.\n\nNext, pick David at 6:41 PM. After Amanda's end time (6:23 PM). So no overlap.\n\nNext, pick Melissa at 7:48 PM. After David's end time (6:41 PM). So no overlap.\n\nNext, pick Elizabeth at 7:53 PM. After Melissa's end time (7:48 PM). So no overlap.\n\nFinally, pick Thomas at 8:12 PM. After Elizabeth's end time (7:53 PM). So no overlap.\n\nSo in this order, I can meet Sandra, Kenneth, Robert, Kimberly, Amanda, David, Melissa, Elizabeth, Thomas. That's 9 people.\n\nBut wait, let's check if all these meetings are possible.\n\nWait, Sandra is from 9:00 AM to 11:12 AM.\n\nThen Kenneth from 12:35 PM to 1:10 PM (12:35 +45).\n\nThen Robert from 2:37 PM to 2:52 PM (2:37 +15).\n\nThen Kimberly from 5:00 PM to 5:15 PM (5:00 +105).\n\nWait, wait, Kimberly needs 105 minutes. So if I start at 5:00 PM, I arrive at Sunset District at 5:15 PM, meet until 6:00 PM (5:15 +105=6:00 PM). Wait, no: T +15 (travel) +105 (meeting) = T +120. So if I start at 5:00 PM, I arrive at 5:15 PM, meet until 6:15 PM.\n\nBut her availability is until 6:15 PM, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but in the earlier calculation, her meeting ends at 5:00 PM +105=6:00 PM? No, wait, the meeting starts at T, arrives at T+15, meets for 105 minutes, so ends at T+15+105=T+120.\n\nSo if T=5:00 PM, ends at 6:00 PM, which is within her availability of 6:15 PM.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nThen Amanda: starts at 6:23 PM, arrives at Golden Gate Park at 6:23 +17=6:40 PM. Meets until 6:40 +15=6:55 PM. But her availability is until 6:45 PM. So 6:55 PM is after 6:45 PM. That's a problem.\n\nSo Amanda's meeting would end at 6:55 PM, which is after her availability ends at 6:45 PM. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo I need to adjust the schedule.\n\nPerhaps instead of picking Amanda after Kimberly, I can pick someone else.\n\nWait, let's see. After Kimberly at 5:00 PM, the next person is Amanda, but her meeting would end at 6:23 PM +15=6:38 PM, which is within her availability of 6:45 PM.\n\nWait, no: T is the start time at Amanda's location.\n\nWait, for Amanda, T is the start time at Golden Gate Park.\n\nSo T +15 (meeting) <=6:45 PM.\n\nSo T <=6:45 PM -15=6:30 PM.\n\nSo if I start at 6:30 PM, meet until 6:45 PM.\n\nSo her window is from 9:00 AM to 6:30 PM.\n\nSo if I pick Amanda at 6:30 PM, that's possible.\n\nBut in the earlier selection, after Kimberly at 5:00 PM, the next earliest is Amanda at 6:23 PM.\n\nWait, but in the sorted list, after Kimberly (5:00 PM), the next is Amanda at 6:23 PM.\n\nSo let's try to pick Amanda at 6:23 PM.\n\nSo T=6:23 PM.\n\nShe meets from 6:23 PM to 6:38 PM (6:23 +15).\n\nBut her availability is until 6:45 PM, so that's fine.\n\nThen, next is David at 6:41 PM.\n\nBut David's meeting starts at 6:41 PM, which is after Amanda's end time of 6:38 PM. So that's okay.\n\nSo David can be met from 6:41 PM to 6:41 +45=7:26 PM.\n\nThen, Melissa at 7:48 PM.\n\nDavid ends at 7:26 PM, so Melissa can be met from 7:48 PM to 8:08 PM.\n\nBut Melissa's availability is until 8:00 PM, so that's fine.\n\nThen Elizabeth at 7:53 PM.\n\nBut Melissa ends at 8:08 PM, which is after Elizabeth's start time of 7:53 PM. So Elizabeth can't be met after Melissa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps pick Elizabeth before Melissa.\n\nWait, but in the sorted list, Elizabeth ends at 7:53 PM, which is earlier than Melissa's 7:48 PM? No, 7:53 is later than 7:48. So in the sorted list, Melissa ends at 7:48 PM, which is earlier than Elizabeth's 7:53 PM.\n\nSo the order is Melissa at 7:48 PM, then Elizabeth at 7:53 PM.\n\nSo after David at 7:26 PM, the next is Melissa at 7:48 PM.\n\nSo Melissa meets from 7:48 PM to 8:08 PM, but her availability is until 8:00 PM, so she can only meet until 8:00 PM. So her meeting ends at 8:00 PM.\n\nThen, Elizabeth can't be met because she starts at 7:53 PM, which is before Melissa's end time. So overlapping.\n\nSo perhaps after David, pick Elizabeth instead.\n\nWait, but Elizabeth's meeting starts at 7:53 PM, which is after David's end time of 7:26 PM. So that's possible.\n\nSo let's adjust the order.\n\nAfter Kimberly at 5:00 PM, pick Elizabeth at 7:53 PM.\n\nBut then, after Elizabeth, the next is Thomas at 8:12 PM.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Sandra: 9:00-11:12\n2. Kenneth:12:35-1:10\n3. Robert:2:37-2:52\n4. Kimberly:5:00-6:15\n5. Elizabeth:7:53-7:53+90=8:23 PM\n6. Thomas:8:12-8:42 PM\n\nWait, but Elizabeth's meeting ends at 8:23 PM, which is after Thomas's start time of 8:12 PM. So overlapping.\n\nSo Thomas can't be met after Elizabeth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps pick Thomas before Elizabeth.\n\nBut Thomas's meeting starts at 8:12 PM, which is after Elizabeth's start time of 7:53 PM. So they would overlap.\n\nSo it's impossible to meet both Elizabeth and Thomas.\n\nSo perhaps choose between them.\n\nSimilarly, Melissa is available from 6:15 PM, but if I pick Elizabeth at 7:53 PM, then I can't pick Melissa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps pick Melissa instead of Elizabeth.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nAfter Kimberly at 5:00 PM, pick Melissa at 7:48 PM.\n\nMelissa meets from 7:48 PM to 8:08 PM, but her availability is until 8:00 PM, so she can meet until 8:00 PM.\n\nThen, after Melissa, pick Thomas at 8:12 PM.\n\nBut Thomas starts at 8:12 PM, which is after Melissa's end time of 8:00 PM. So that's fine.\n\nSo Thomas can be met from 8:12 PM to 8:42 PM (8:12 +30).\n\nThen, can I pick someone else after Thomas?\n\nNo, because everyone else is either already met or their meeting times overlap.\n\nSo in this case, the schedule would be:\n\nSandra, Kenneth, Robert, Kimberly, Melissa, Thomas.\n\nThat's 6 people.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to pick Amanda, it caused a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps pick Amanda after someone else.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nAfter Sandra, Kenneth, Robert, Kimberly, pick Amanda at 6:23 PM.\n\nThen, after Amanda, pick David at 6:41 PM.\n\nDavid meets from 6:41 PM to 7:26 PM.\n\nThen, pick Melissa at 7:48 PM.\n\nMelissa meets from 7:48 PM to 8:08 PM, but her availability is until 8:00 PM, so she can meet until 8:00 PM.\n\nThen, Thomas at 8:12 PM.\n\nSo in this case, the meetings are Sandra, Kenneth, Robert, Kimberly, Amanda, David, Melissa, Thomas.\n\nThat's 8 people.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Amanda's meeting would end at 6:38 PM, which is within her availability. So that's fine.\n\nThen, David at 6:41 PM, which is after Amanda's end time.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nThen Melissa at 7:48 PM, after David's end time.\n\nThen Thomas at 8:12 PM, after Melissa's end time.\n\nSo that's 8 people.\n\nBut let me check all the meeting times:\n\n1. Sandra: 9:00-11:12\n2. Kenneth:12:35-1:10\n3. Robert:2:37-2:52\n4. Kimberly:5:00-6:15\n5. Amanda:6:23-6:38\n6. David:6:41-7:26\n7. Melissa:7:48-8:00\n8. Thomas:8:12-8:42\n\nYes, none of these overlap.\n\nSo that's 8 people. Can I fit more?\n\nWhat about Elizabeth? She's available from 10:13 AM to 7:53 PM.\n\nIn this schedule, the last meeting before her availability is Robert at 2:37 PM.\n\nSo if I can fit Elizabeth after Robert, but her meeting starts at 10:13 AM, which is before Robert's meeting.\n\nWait, no. Elizabeth's meeting starts at 10:13 AM, which is before Robert's meeting at 2:37 PM. So she can't be met in this schedule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps replace someone else with Elizabeth.\n\nBut in this case, we've already met 8 people, which is more than the initial approach.\n\nWait, but Sandra is a must because she's available all day and needs a long time. Without her, I can meet more people, but she's a high priority.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal is 8 people.\n\nBut let me see if I can include Elizabeth.\n\nSuppose I don't meet Sandra, but instead meet Elizabeth and others.\n\nBut Sandra needs 120 minutes, which is a long time. Without her, I can meet more people, but perhaps the total time is less.\n\nBut the goal is to meet as many as possible, regardless of time, but considering the required durations.\n\nWait, the problem says \"meet as many friends as possible\", so the priority is the number of people met, not the total time.\n\nSo perhaps it's better to skip Sandra to meet more people.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nWithout Sandra:\n\nNow, the possible meetings are:\n\n1. Amanda:9:00-6:23 PM\n2. Elizabeth:10:13 AM-7:53 PM\n3. Kenneth:9:00-12:35 PM\n4. Robert:9:00-2:37 PM\n5. David:9:00-6:41 PM\n6. Thomas:9:00-8:12 PM\n7. Melissa:9:00-7:48 PM\n8. Kimberly:9:00-5:00 PM\n\nNow, let's sort these by end time:\n\n1. Amanda:6:23 PM\n2. Kimberly:5:00 PM\n3. Robert:2:37 PM\n4. Kenneth:12:35 PM\n5. David:6:41 PM\n6. Melissa:7:48 PM\n7. Elizabeth:7:53 PM\n8. Thomas:8:12 PM\n\nSo the order is Amanda, Kimberly, Robert, Kenneth, David, Melissa, Elizabeth, Thomas.\n\nNow, pick the earliest ending:\n\n1. Amanda:9:00-6:23 PM\n2. Kimberly:9:00-5:00 PM\n3. Robert:9:00-2:37 PM\n4. Kenneth:9:00-12:35 PM\n5. David:9:00-6:41 PM\n6. Melissa:9:00-7:48 PM\n7. Elizabeth:10:13 AM-7:53 PM\n8. Thomas:9:00-8:12 PM\n\nWait, but Kimberly ends earlier than Amanda, so pick Kimberly first.\n\nPick Kimberly:9:00-5:00 PM.\n\nThen, next earliest is Robert at 2:37 PM.\n\nCheck if Robert starts after Kimberly ends. Kimberly ends at 5:00 PM, Robert starts at 2:37 PM. So no, they overlap.\n\nSo can't pick Robert after Kimberly.\n\nSo perhaps pick Robert before Kimberly.\n\nWait, but in the sorted list, Robert ends earlier than Kimberly. So perhaps I should pick Robert first.\n\nLet me try:\n\nPick Robert:9:00-2:37 PM.\n\nThen, next earliest is Kenneth:12:35 PM.\n\nCheck if Kenneth starts after Robert ends. Robert ends at 2:37 PM, Kenneth starts at 12:35 PM. So no, they overlap.\n\nSo can't pick Kenneth after Robert.\n\nAlternatively, pick Kenneth before Robert.\n\nKenneth ends at 12:35 PM, which is before Robert's start time of 9:00 AM? No, both start at 9:00 AM.\n\nWait, no, Kenneth's meeting starts at 9:00 AM, same as Robert.\n\nSo they can't be both picked.\n\nSo perhaps pick Robert first, then Kenneth can't be picked.\n\nAlternatively, pick Kenneth first, then Robert can't be picked.\n\nSo perhaps pick Kenneth first.\n\nKenneth:9:00-12:35 PM.\n\nThen, next earliest is Robert at 2:37 PM.\n\nNo overlap, so pick Robert.\n\nThen, next is David at 6:41 PM.\n\nNo overlap with Robert.\n\nThen, next is Amanda at 6:23 PM. Wait, but David ends at 6:41 PM, which is after Amanda's end time of 6:23 PM. So Amanda can't be picked after David.\n\nAlternatively, pick Amanda before David.\n\nSo:\n\nKenneth:9:00-12:35 PM.\n\nAmanda:6:23 PM-6:38 PM.\n\nDavid:6:41 PM-7:26 PM.\n\nThen, Melissa:7:48 PM-8:08 PM.\n\nThomas:8:12 PM-8:42 PM.\n\nElizabeth:7:53 PM-8:23 PM.\n\nWait, but Elizabeth's meeting starts at 7:53 PM, which is during Melissa's meeting. So can't pick both.\n\nAlternatively, pick Elizabeth after Melissa.\n\nBut Thomas is at 8:12 PM, which is after Melissa's end time.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nKenneth:9:00-12:35 PM.\n\nAmanda:6:23-6:38 PM.\n\nDavid:6:41-7:26 PM.\n\nMelissa:7:48-8:08 PM.\n\nThomas:8:12-8:42 PM.\n\nThat's 5 people.\n\nBut earlier, with Sandra included, we had 8 people.\n\nSo including Sandra is better.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal is to include Sandra and meet 8 people.\n\nBut let me confirm.\n\nWith Sandra, the meetings are:\n\n1. Sandra:9:00-11:12 PM.\n\n2. Kenneth:12:35-1:10 PM.\n\n3. Robert:2:37-2:52 PM.\n\n4. Kimberly:5:00-6:15 PM.\n\n5. Amanda:6:23-6:38 PM.\n\n6. David:6:41-7:26 PM.\n\n7. Melissa:7:48-8:00 PM.\n\n8. Thomas:8:12-8:42 PM.\n\nYes, all 8 meetings fit without overlapping.\n\nSo the final itinerary would be:\n\n- Meet Sandra at Pacific Heights from 9:00 AM to 11:12 AM.\n\n- Then Kenneth at Marina District from 12:35 PM to 1:10 PM.\n\n- Then Robert at Fisherman's Wharf from 2:37 PM to 2:52 PM.\n\n- Then Kimberly at Sunset District from 5:00 PM to 6:15 PM.\n\n- Then Amanda at Golden Gate Park from 6:23 PM to 6:38 PM.\n\n- Then David at Union Square from 6:41 PM to 7:26 PM.\n\n- Then Melissa at Richmond District from 7:48 PM to 8:00 PM.\n\n- Finally, Thomas at Bayview from 8:12 PM to 8:42 PM.\n\nThat's 8 people met.\n\nIs there a way to include Elizabeth?\n\nIf I include Elizabeth, I have to exclude someone else.\n\nLooking at Elizabeth's meeting window:10:13 AM-7:53 PM.\n\nIn the current schedule, the last meeting before her availability is Robert at 2:37 PM.\n\nSo perhaps replace someone after Robert with Elizabeth.\n\nFor example:\n\nAfter Robert at 2:37 PM, instead of Kimberly, pick Elizabeth.\n\nBut Elizabeth starts at 10:13 AM, which is before Robert's meeting.\n\nSo that would cause overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adjust the schedule.\n\nWait, perhaps after Sandra, Kenneth, Robert, pick Elizabeth.\n\nBut Robert ends at 2:37 PM, Elizabeth starts at 10:13 AM, which is before Robert's meeting. So can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Sandra, Kenneth, Elizabeth.\n\nBut Kenneth ends at 1:10 PM, which is before Elizabeth's start time of 10:13 AM? No, 1:10 PM is after 10:13 AM.\n\nWait, no. 10:13 AM is earlier than 1:10 PM. So if I leave Kenneth at 1:10 PM, I can't meet Elizabeth at 10:13 AM.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps it's better to stick with the 8-person schedule including Sandra.\n\nTherefore, the optimal schedule is to meet Sandra, Kenneth, Robert, Kimberly, Amanda, David, Melissa, and Thomas, totaling 8 people.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to schedule a series of meetings in San Francisco, starting from Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM, such that we can meet as many friends as possible within their availability constraints and travel times. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings while respecting each person's availability and ensuring that each meeting is feasible given travel times.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Constraints**: Each person has specific availability windows and required meeting durations. The travel time from Haight-Ashbury to each location must also be considered.\n2. **Determine Feasible Meeting Windows**: For each person, calculate the earliest and latest possible times to meet based on their availability and travel time from Haight-Ashbury.\n3. **Sort Meetings by End Time**: To maximize the number of non-overlapping meetings, sort the feasible meeting windows by their end times.\n4. **Select Non-overlapping Meetings**: Using a greedy algorithm, select the earliest ending meeting first, then the next compatible meeting, and so on.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport

Calculation**: The code first calculates the travel time from Haight-Ashbury to each location using a predefined dictionary.\n2. **Feasible Meeting Times**: For each person, it calculates the earliest and latest possible times to meet based on their availability and travel time.\n3. **Sorting Meetings**: The feasible meetings are sorted by their end times to facilitate the selection of non-overlapping meetings.\n4. **Selecting Meetings**: Using a greedy algorithm, the code selects the earliest ending meeting, ensuring no overlap with previously selected meetings, until no more meetings can be added.\n5. **Output**: The resulting itinerary is formatted as a JSON object, detailing each meeting's location, person, start, and end times.\n\nThis approach ensures that the maximum number of meetings is scheduled without overlapping times, considering all travel and availability constraints.",
