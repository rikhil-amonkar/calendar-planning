            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to schedule meetings with different friends in San Francisco, considering their availability and the travel times between locations. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings while respecting all constraints.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the input parameters. The user arrives at Golden Gate Park (GGP) at 9:00 AM. The friends are available at specific times and places, and each meeting requires a minimum duration. I need to figure out when and where to meet each person, ensuring that all travel times are accounted for and that the meetings don't overlap beyond their availability.\n\nLet me list out all the friends and their constraints:\n\n1. **Joseph** is at Fisherman's Wharf (FW) from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM. We need at least 90 minutes together.\n2. **Jeffrey** is at Bayview (BV) from 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM. We need 60 minutes.\n3. **Kevin** is in the Mission District (MD) from 11:15 AM to 3:15 PM. 30 minutes.\n4. **David** is at Embarcadero (EB) from 8:15 AM to 9:00 AM. 30 minutes.\n5. **Barbara** is in the Financial District (FD) from 10:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 15 minutes.\n\nI start by considering the earliest possible meetings. David is available from 8:15 to 9:00 AM at Embarcadero. Since I arrive at GGP at 9:00, I can't make it to David's meeting unless I leave GGP by 8:30 to reach Embarcadero in time. The travel time from GGP to Embarcadero is 25 minutes. So I'd need to leave GGP at 8:15 to arrive by 8:40, but David is only available until 9:00. Wait, that doesn't add up. Let me check the travel times again.\n\nLooking at the distances, the travel time from GGP to Embarcadero is 25 minutes. If I leave GGP at 8:35, I'll arrive at 9:00. But David is only available until 9:00, so maybe a 30-minute meeting is possible if I arrive exactly at 9:00. But the minimum is 30 minutes, so maybe that's tight. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to meet someone else earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I can meet David at 8:40 AM. Let me calculate: leave GGP at 8:15, arrive at Embarcadero at 8:40. But David is only available until 9:00. So that's a 20-minute meeting, which is less than the required 30 minutes. So that's not possible. Alternatively, leave GGP at 8:30, arrive at 8:55. That's 5 minutes before David's 9:00 end time, so we can have a 5-minute meeting, which is too short. So maybe I can't meet David unless I can spend at least 30 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should prioritize other meetings that have more flexible availability or require less time. For example, Barbara is available from 10:30 AM, which is after my arrival time. But she only needs 15 minutes, which is quick.\n\nLet me think about the possible meeting times for each person, considering both my schedule and theirs.\n\nStarting with David: he's only available from 8:15 to 9:00 at Embarcadero. To meet him, I need to leave GGP by 8:30 at the latest to arrive by 8:55. But that's only 5 minutes before his end time. The minimum is 30 minutes, so that's not enough. Therefore, I can't meet David.\n\nNext, Joseph is available from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM at Fisherman's Wharf. The earliest I can meet him is after arriving at GGP at 9:00. Let's see the travel time from GGP to FW is 24 minutes. So if I leave GGP at 9:00, I arrive at 9:24. That's within Joseph's availability. We need at least 90 minutes together. So the meeting would start at 9:24 and end at 11:54. But Joseph is available until 5:30 PM, so that's feasible. So that's a possible meeting.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can meet someone else earlier. Let's check Kevin. He's available from 11:15 AM to 3:15 PM in the Mission District. The travel time from GGP to MD is 17 minutes. If I leave GGP at 11:15, I arrive at 11:32. That's within Kevin's availability. We need 30 minutes. So the meeting would be from 11:32 to 12:02. That's possible.\n\nBut I have to see if I can fit in both Joseph and Kevin. Let's see:\n\n- Meeting Joseph at 9:24-11:54, then traveling from FW to somewhere else.\n- Then, from FW to MD would take 22 minutes (from FW to MD is 22). So if I leave FW at 11:54, I arrive at MD at 12:16. That's within Kevin's availability, which starts at 11:15, so maybe I can adjust the meeting time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Kevin earlier. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach is to list all possible meetings with each person and see which combination fits without overlapping.\n\nLet me outline each possible meeting:\n\n1. **Joseph**: Possible times from 9:00 to 5:30 PM at FW. Need 90 minutes.\n\n2. **Jeffrey**: Available from 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM at BV. Need 60 minutes.\n\n3. **Kevin**: Available from 11:15 AM to 3:15 PM at MD. Need 30 minutes.\n\n4. **David**: Only until 9:00 AM at EB. Can't meet due to time constraints.\n\n5. **Barbara**: Available from 10:30 AM to 4:30 PM at FD. Need 15 minutes.\n\nI need to maximize the number of meetings, so I should aim to fit as many as possible.\n\nLet's consider the earliest possible meetings.\n\nFirst, check if I can meet Barbara. She's available from 10:30 AM. Travel time from GGP to FD is 26 minutes. So if I leave GGP at 10:30, I arrive at FD at 10:56. That's within her availability. A 15-minute meeting would end at 11:11. That's feasible.\n\nThen, from FD, I can go to Kevin's location in MD, which is 17 minutes away. So I'd leave FD at 11:11, arrive at MD at 11:28. Kevin is available until 3:15 PM, so that's fine. A 30-minute meeting would end at 11:58.\n\nThen, from MD, I can go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Joseph. The travel time is 22 minutes. So leaving MD at 11:58, arrive at FW at 12:20. Joseph is available until 5:30 PM, so a 90-minute meeting would end at 3:10 PM.\n\nAfter that, I can go to Bayview to meet Jeffrey. The travel time from FW to BV is 26 minutes. Leaving FW at 3:10, arrive at BV at 3:36. Jeffrey is available from 5:30 PM, so that's too early. Alternatively, maybe I can meet Jeffrey later.\n\nWait, Jeffrey is available from 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM. If I leave FW at 3:10, I arrive at BV at 3:36, which is before his availability. So perhaps I need to adjust the schedule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should meet Jeffrey earlier. Let me see: if I leave BV at 5:30 PM, I need to arrive there by then. Let me see the possible times.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try a different order. Let's see:\n\n- Meet Barbara at 10:30-11:11.\n- Then go to Kevin at 11:11-11:41.\n- Then go to Joseph at 11:41-2:31 PM.\n- Then go to Jeffrey at 2:31-4:11 PM (but Jeffrey is available from 5:30 PM, so that's too early).\n- Alternatively, after meeting Joseph, maybe go to Jeffrey's location at 3:10 PM.\n\nWait, from Joseph's meeting at 2:31 PM, I can leave FW at 2:31, travel to BV (26 minutes), arrive at 2:57 PM. But Jeffrey isn't available until 5:30 PM, so that's too early. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Kevin, perhaps I can go to Jeffrey's location later.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to meet Joseph last, after meeting the others.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Meet Barbara at 10:30-11:11 at FD.\n2. Travel to MD, arrive at 11:28. Meet Kevin until 11:58.\n3. Travel to FW, arrive at 12:20. Meet Joseph until 2:10 PM (12:20 + 1 hour 50 minutes).\n4. Travel to BV, arrive at 2:20 + 26 minutes = 2:47 PM. But Jeffrey isn't available until 5:30 PM, so that's too early.\n5. Alternatively, after meeting Joseph, go to Jeffrey's location at 2:10 PM. Travel time to BV is 26 minutes, arrive at 2:36 PM. Still too early.\n\nHmm, that doesn't work. So perhaps I can't meet Jeffrey unless I leave earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I can meet Jeffrey at 5:30 PM. Let's see:\n\n- After meeting Joseph at 2:10 PM, I can leave FW and go to BV. Travel time is 26 minutes, so arrive at 2:36 PM. That's before Jeffrey's availability. So I need to find a way to have a meeting at 5:30 PM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can't meet Jeffrey because the required 60 minutes would take too much time. Let me see: if I leave BV at 5:30 PM, I need to arrive there by then. So perhaps I can meet him at 5:30 PM, but that's the start time. So the meeting would be from 5:30 to 6:30 PM, which is 60 minutes. But how do I get there?\n\nLet me think about the travel times:\n\n- From FW to BV is 26 minutes. So if I leave FW at 5:00 PM, I arrive at BV at 5:26 PM. That's before 5:30. So I can leave FW at 5:00, arrive at BV at 5:26, but Jeffrey starts at 5:30. So that's a 4-minute wait. Maybe that's acceptable, but I'm not sure if that's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, leave FW at 5:30 PM, arrive at BV at 5:56 PM. That's within his availability. So the meeting would be from 5:56 to 6:36 PM. That's 40 minutes, which is more than the required 60, but it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but the minimum is 60 minutes, so 40 is too short. So perhaps it's better to leave earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can adjust the earlier meetings to allow for a later Jeffrey meeting.\n\nLet me try another approach:\n\n1. Meet Barbara at 10:30-11:11 at FD.\n2. Go to Kevin at 11:11-11:41 at MD.\n3. Go to Joseph at 11:41-12:11 at FW. Wait, but the travel time from MD to FW is 22 minutes. So leaving MD at 11:41, arrive at FW at 12:03. Then, meet Joseph from 12:03 to 1:33 PM (90 minutes). That works.\n4. Then, go to BV. From FW to BV is 26 minutes. Leaving at 1:33, arrive at 1:59 PM. But Jeffrey isn't available until 5:30 PM, so that's too early.\n5. Alternatively, after meeting Joseph, maybe go to Jeffrey's location later.\n\nWait, perhaps I can leave Joseph's meeting later. If I leave FW at 12:03, I can go to BV, but that's too early. Alternatively, perhaps I can meet Joseph later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Joseph at 2:00 PM. Let me see:\n\n- Leave GGP at 9:00, arrive at FW at 9:24.\n- Meet Joseph from 9:24 to 10:54 (90 minutes). Then, go to MD, which takes 22 minutes, arrive at 10:54 + 22 = 11:16. Meet Kevin from 11:16 to 11:46. Then, go to FD, which takes 17 minutes (from MD to FD is 17). Arrive at 11:46 + 17 = 12:03. Meet Barbara from 12:03 to 12:18 (15 minutes). Then, go to BV, which takes 19 minutes (from FD to BV is 19). Arrive at 12:18 + 19 = 12:37. That's too early for Jeffrey.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara, go to Jeffrey's location. From FD to BV is 19 minutes. So leaving FD at 12:18, arrive at BV at 12:37. Still too early.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I need to prioritize which meetings to attend based on the required time and their availability.\n\nLet me consider the following plan:\n\n- Meet Barbara at 10:30 AM for 15 minutes.\n- Then go to Kevin at 11:11 AM for 30 minutes.\n- Then go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Joseph for 90 minutes.\n- Then go to Bayview to meet Jeffrey for 60 minutes.\n\nLet's calculate the times:\n\n1. Barbara: 10:30-11:11 at FD.\n2. Travel from FD to MD: 17 minutes, arrive at 11:28.\n3. Meet Kevin from 11:28-11:58 at MD.\n4. Travel from MD to FW: 22 minutes, arrive at 11:58 + 22 = 12:20.\n5. Meet Joseph from 12:20-2:10 PM at FW.\n6. Travel from FW to BV: 26 minutes, arrive at 2:10 + 26 = 2:36 PM.\n7. Meet Jeffrey from 2:36-4:36 PM at BV. But Jeffrey is only available until 9:30 PM, so this is possible, but wait, the minimum is 60 minutes. So from 2:36 to 4:36 is 2 hours, which is more than needed. So that's acceptable.\n8. After that, I can't meet anyone else because it's too late.\n\nWait, but the problem is that I need to have a minimum of 90 minutes with Joseph and 60 with Jeffrey. So this works.\n\nBut let me check the timings:\n\n- Barbara: 10:30-11:11\n- Kevin: 11:28-11:58\n- Joseph: 12:20-2:10\n- Jeffrey: 2:36-4:36\n\nThat's four meetings. Alternatively, maybe I can fit in David, but earlier analysis showed that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Jeffrey earlier by adjusting the schedule.\n\nWait, if I leave FW at 2:10 PM, it's too early to reach Jeffrey. But if I can delay the Joseph meeting, perhaps I can go to Jeffrey earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Jeffrey at 5:30 PM. Let's try:\n\n1. Barbara: 10:30-11:11\n2. Kevin: 11:28-11:58\n3. Joseph: 12:20-2:10\n4. Then, go to Jeffrey's location at 2:10 PM. Travel time from FW to BV is 26 minutes, arrive at 2:36 PM. But Jeffrey isn't available until 5:30 PM. So I have to wait until 5:30 PM. So I can leave BV at 5:30 PM, but that would require leaving earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can leave Joseph's meeting earlier to allow time to meet Jeffrey.\n\nWait, maybe I can meet Joseph from 12:20 to 2:10 PM, then go to Jeffrey's location at 2:10 PM, but that's too early. Alternatively, maybe I can meet Joseph for less time, but the minimum is 90 minutes.\n\nI think the best approach is to meet Barbara, Kevin, Joseph, and Jeffrey, totaling four meetings. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nWait, but the problem is that Jeffrey is available from 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM, so if I leave Joseph's meeting at 2:10 PM, I can go to Jeffrey's location at 2:10 + 26 = 2:36 PM, which is before 5:30 PM. So I can't meet him until 5:30 PM.\n\nSo perhaps the plan is:\n\n1. Meet Barbara at 10:30-11:11\n2. Meet Kevin at 11:28-11:58\n3. Meet Joseph at 12:20-2:10\n4. Meet Jeffrey at 5:30-6:30\n\nBut that's four meetings. Alternatively, maybe I can meet David if I adjust the schedule.\n\nWait, David is available from 8:15 to 9:00 AM at Embarcadero. The travel time from GGP to EB is 25 minutes. So if I leave GGP at 8:15, arrive at 8:40. But David is available until 9:00, so that's only 20 minutes. Not enough for 30 minutes. So can't meet David.\n\nSo the maximum meetings are Barbara, Kevin, Joseph, and Jeffrey.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can fit in another meeting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Barbara, Kevin, Joseph, and Jeffrey, but I'm not sure if that's possible without overlapping.\n\nWait, let's outline the times again:\n\n- Barbara: 10:30-11:11 at FD\n- Kevin: 11:28-11:58 at MD\n- Joseph: 12:20-2:10 at FW\n- Jeffrey: 5:30-6:30 at BV\n\nThat's four meetings. Alternatively, maybe I can meet Barbara, Kevin, Joseph, and Jeffrey, but I need to make sure the travel times are accounted for.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the order of meetings. For example, after meeting Joseph, I can go to Jeffrey's location, but that's too early. So perhaps the only way to meet Jeffrey is to delay the Joseph meeting.\n\nWait, perhaps I can meet Joseph later. Let me see:\n\nIf I leave Joseph's meeting at 2:10 PM, I can go to Jeffrey's location at 2:10 + 26 = 2:36 PM, which is before 5:30 PM. So I can't meet him then. Alternatively, I can leave Joseph's meeting at 3:10 PM, arrive at Jeffrey's at 3:36 PM, which is still before 5:30 PM. So I have to wait until 5:30 PM to meet him.\n\nSo the plan would be:\n\n1. Barbara: 10:30-11:11 at FD\n2. Kevin: 11:28-11:58 at MD\n3. Joseph: 12:20-2:10 at FW\n4. Travel to Jeffrey's location at 2:10 PM, arrive at 2:36 PM, but can't meet until 5:30 PM.\n5. So, after Joseph's meeting, I have to wait at FW until 5:30 PM, then go to BV.\n\nWait, that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe I can leave Joseph's meeting earlier and do something else in between.\n\nBut I don't see another friend available in that time. So perhaps the best plan is to meet Barbara, Kevin, Joseph, and Jeffrey.\n\nBut wait, let me check the total time:\n\n- From 10:30 to 11:11: Barbara\n- 11:11 to 11:28: Travel to MD\n- 11:28 to 11:58: Kevin\n- 11:58 to 12:20: Travel to FW\n- 12:20 to 2:10: Joseph\n- 2:10 to 2:36: Travel to BV\n- 2:36 to 5:30: Wait at BV\n- 5:30 to 6:30: Jeffrey\n\nThat's a long wait at BV. Alternatively, maybe I can use the time between 2:10 PM and 5:30 PM to do something else, but there's no one else available.\n\nSo, the plan is to meet Barbara, Kevin, Joseph, and Jeffrey, totaling four meetings.\n\nWait, but I have to make sure that all the travel times are accounted for and that I'm not double-booking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Barbara, Kevin, and Jeffrey, but not Joseph, but that's fewer meetings.\n\nI think the best plan is to meet Barbara, Kevin, Joseph, and Jeffrey, but I need to make sure the timings add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I can adjust the order to meet Jeffrey earlier. Let me try:\n\n1. Meet Barbara at 10:30-11:11 at FD\n2. Travel to MD, arrive at 11:28\n3. Meet Kevin until 11:58\n4. Travel to FW, arrive at 12:20\n5. Meet Joseph until 2:10 PM\n6. Travel to BV, arrive at 2:36 PM\n7. Since Jeffrey isn't available until 5:30 PM, I have to wait until then.\n8. Meet Jeffrey from 5:30-6:30 PM\n\nThat's four meetings, but I have to wait a long time at BV.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Jeffrey at 5:30 PM, but that would require leaving FW at 5:00 PM, arriving at BV at 5:26 PM. That's within his availability. So the meeting would be from 5:26 to 6:26 PM, which is 60 minutes. That's acceptable.\n\nSo the plan would be:\n\n1. Barbara: 10:30-11:11 at FD\n2. Kevin: 11:28-11:58 at MD\n3. Joseph: 12:20-2:10 at FW\n4. Jeffrey: 5:26-6:26 at BV\n\nThat's four meetings. Alternatively, perhaps I can meet Barbara, Kevin, Joseph, and Jeffrey, but I need to check if I can fit all in.\n\nWait, let me outline the exact times with travel:\n\n- 10:30-11:11: Barbara at FD\n- 11:11-11:28: Travel to MD (17 minutes)\n- 11:28-11:58: Kevin at MD\n- 11:58-12:20: Travel to FW (22 minutes)\n- 12:20-2:10: Joseph at FW (90 minutes)\n- 2:10-2:36: Travel to BV (26 minutes)\n- 2:36-5:30: Wait at BV\n- 5:30-6:30: Jeffrey at BV (60 minutes)\n\nYes, that works. So the itinerary would include these four meetings.\n\nWait, but I have to make sure that the end times of each meeting allow for the next one. For example, after meeting Joseph at 2:10 PM, I can leave FW at 2:10 PM, travel to BV, arrive at 2:36 PM, and then wait until 5:30 PM to meet Jeffrey.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can leave FW earlier to reach BV earlier, but Jeffrey isn't available until 5:30 PM. So the earliest I can meet him is at 5:30 PM.\n\nSo, in the plan, after meeting Joseph at 2:10 PM, I can go to BV at 2:10 PM, arrive at 2:36 PM, but since Jeffrey isn't available until 5:30 PM, I have to wait until then.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\n- Barbara at 10:30-11:11\n- Kevin at 11:28-11:58\n- Joseph at 12:20-2:10\n- Jeffrey at 5:30-6:30\n\nThat's four meetings. Alternatively, perhaps I can meet Barbara, Kevin, Joseph, and Jeffrey, but I need to make sure the timings are correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the travel times again. From FD to MD is 17 minutes, which is correct. From MD to FW is 22 minutes, correct. From FW to BV is 26 minutes, correct.\n\nSo the plan is feasible.\n\nNow, I need to write a Python program that takes into account all these constraints and computes the optimal schedule. The program should consider all possible combinations of meetings and choose the one that maximizes the number of meetings while respecting the constraints.\n\nThe program will need to:\n\n1. Read the travel distances between locations.\n2. Read the constraints for each friend.\n3. Generate all possible meeting times for each friend.\n4. Check for overlaps and feasibility.\n5. Select the optimal schedule with the maximum number of meetings.\n\nGiven the complexity, the program might need to use a backtracking approach or heuristic to find the best schedule.\n\nHowever, since the problem is to write a Python program that actually computes the plan, perhaps a heuristic approach would be more feasible, such as prioritizing the friends based on the earliest possible meeting times and maximum required duration.\n\nIn the end, the optimal schedule includes meetings with Barbara, Kevin, Joseph, and Jeffrey.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to schedule a series of meetings in San Francisco, considering the travel times between locations and the availability of each friend. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings while respecting all constraints.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves:\n1. **Understanding the Constraints**: Each friend has specific time slots and minimum meeting durations.\n2. **Calculating Travel Times**: Using the given travel distances, we determine the time required to travel between each pair of locations.\n3. **Scheduling Meetings**: We prioritize meetings that can be scheduled earliest and fit within the availability of both the user and the friend. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    # From Golden Gate Park (GGP)\n    \"GGP\": {\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 24,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 23,\n        \"Mission District (MD)\": 17,\n        \"Embarcadero (EB)\": 25,\n        \"Financial District (FD)\": 26,\n    },\n    # From Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\n    \"FW\": {\n        \"GGP\": 25,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 26,\n        \"Mission District (MD)\": 22,\n        \"Embarcadero (EB)\": 8,\n        \"Financial District (FD)\": 11,\n    },\n    # From Bayview (BV)\n    \"BV\": {\n        \"GGP\": 22,\n        \"FW\": 25,\n        \"Mission District (MD)\": 13,\n        \"Embarcadero (EB)\": 19,\n        \"Financial District (FD)\": 19,\n    },\n    # From Mission District (MD)\n    \"MD\": {\n        \"GGP\": 17,\n        \"FW\": 22,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 15,\n        \"Embarcadero (EB)\": 19,\n        \"Financial District (FD)\": 17,\n    },\n    # From Embarcadero (EB)\n    \"EB\": {\n        \"GGP\": 25,\n        \"FW\": 6,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 21,\n        \"Mission District (MD)\": 20,\n        \"Financial District (FD)\": 4,\n    },\n    # From Financial District (FD)\n    \"FD\": {\n        \"GGP\": 23,\n        \"FW\": 10,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 19,\n        \"Mission District (MD)\": 17,\n        \"Embarcadero (EB)\": 4,\n    },\n}\n\n# Read constraints\nconstraints = {\n    \"Joseph\": {\n        \"start\": \"8:00\",\n        \"end\": \"17:30\",\n        \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\",\n        \"duration\": 90,\n    },\n    \"Jeffrey\": {\n        \"start\": \"17:30\",\n        \"end\": \"21:30\",\n        \"location\": \"Bayview (BV)\",\n        \"duration\": 60,\n    },\n    \"Kevin\": {\n        \"start\": \"11:15\",\n        \"end\": \"14:15\",\n        \"location\": \"Mission District (MD)\",\n        \"duration\": 30,\n    },\n    \"David\": {\n        \"start\": \"8:15\",\n        \"end\": \"9:00\",\n        \"location\": \"Embarcadero (EB)\",\n        \"duration\": 30,\n    },\n    \"Barbara\": {\n        \"start\": \"10:30\",\n        \"end\": \"16:30\",\n        \"location\": \"Financial District (FD)\",\n        \"duration\": 15,\n    },\n}\n\n# Starting location is Golden Gate Park (GGP) at 9:00 AM\nstart_time = \"9:00\"\n\ndef compute_schedule():\n    from copy import deepcopy\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    import itertools\n\n    # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    def time_to_min(t):\n        h, m = map(int, t.split(':'))\n        return h * 60 + m\n\n    def min_to_time(m):\n        return f\"{(m // 60):02d}:{m % 60:02d}\"\n\n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    constraintsConvert = {}\n    for name, constr in constraints.items():\n        start = time_to_min(constr[\"start\"])\n        end = time_to_min(constr[\"end\"])\n        constraintsConvert[name] = {\n            \"start\": start,\n            \"end\": end,\n            \"location\": constr[\"location\"],\n            \"duration\": constr[\"duration\"],\n        }\n\n    locations = [\"GGP\", \"FW\", \"BV\", \"MD\", \"EB\", \"FD\"]\n\n    # Generate possible meeting times for each person\n    all_people = [\"Joseph\", \"Jeffrey\", \"Kevin\", \"David\", \"Barbara\"]\n    possible_meetings = {}\n\n    for person in all_people:\n        person_constraints = constraintsConvert[person]\n        possible_meetings[person] = []\n        for loc in locations:\n            if loc == person_constraints[\"location\"]:\n                continue\n            travel_time = travel_times[f\"{loc} to {person_constraints['location']}\"]\n            earliest_meet = person_constraints[\"start\"] + travel_time\n            latest_meet = person_constraints[\"end\"] -
