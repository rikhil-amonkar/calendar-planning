            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is visiting San Francisco and wants to meet as many friends as possible, considering the travel times and constraints provided. The goal is to create an optimal meeting schedule using Python code.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the constraints. The user arrives at the Sunset District at 9:00 AM. They have two main friends to meet: Anthony in Chinatown and Rebecca in Russian Hill. Additionally, there's Melissa in North Beach, but the user needs to decide the optimal order of meetings to maximize the number of friends met.\n\nNext, I'll look at the travel distances between the locations. The distances provided will help calculate the time needed to travel between areas. I'll note that the user needs to travel from Sunset District to various locations, and each friend is available at specific times.\n\nNow, considering the availability:\n- Anthony is available from 1:15 PM to 2:30 PM.\n- Rebecca is available from 7:30 PM to 9:15 PM.\n- Melissa is available from 8:15 AM to 1:30 PM.\n\nThe user's goal is to meet each friend for a minimum duration: 60 minutes for Anthony, 105 minutes for Rebecca, and 105 minutes for Melissa.\n\nI'll start by calculating the latest possible start times for each meeting to ensure the minimum required time is met. For Anthony, the latest he can start is 2:30 PM minus 60 minutes, which is 1:30 PM. For Rebecca, her latest start time is 7:30 PM minus 105 minutes, which is 6:45 PM. Melissa, needing 105 minutes, can start as late as 12:45 PM.\n\nSince the user arrives at Sunset District at 9:00 AM, I'll consider the travel time to each location. Meeting Melissa first might be optimal because she's available early in the day. The user can travel from Sunset District to North Beach, which takes 29 minutes, and meet Melissa from 9:29 AM to 10:34 AM. This fits within Melissa's availability and allows the user to then travel to Chinatown for Anthony.\n\nAfter meeting Melissa, the user can head to Chinatown. The travel time from North Beach to Chinatown is 6 minutes. They can then meet Anthony from 10:34 AM to 1:34 PM, which fits within his availability.\n\nFinally, the user can travel from Chinatown to Russian Hill for Rebecca. The travel time is 9 minutes. They can meet her from 1:34 PM to 3:39 PM, which is within her availability.\n\nThis schedule meets all the constraints and allows the user to meet all three friends without any overlaps or missed opportunities. The Python code will implement this logic, calculating the exact times and ensuring all travel and availability constraints are respected.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n```python\n# Define the input parameters\nsunset_district_to_chinatown = 30\nsunset_district_to_russian_hill = 24\nsunset_district_to_north_beach = 29\nch Chinatown_to_sunset_district = 29\nch Chinatown_to_russian_hill = 7\nch Chinatown_to_north_beach = 3\nrussian_hill_to_sunset_district = 23\nrussian_hill_to_chinatown = 9\nrussian_hill_to_north_beach = 5\nnorth_beach_to_sunset_district = 27\nnorth_beach_to_chinatown = 6\nnorth_beach_to_russian_hill = 4\n\n# Define the arrival and availability times\nuser_arrival_sunset_district = '9:00'  # 9:00 AM\nanthony_available_start = '13:15'  # 1:15 PM\nanthony_available_end = '14:30'  # 2:30 PM\nrebecca_available_start = '19:30'  # 7:30 PM\nrebecca_available_end = '21:15'  # 9:15 PM\nmelissa_available_start = '8:15'  # 8:15 AM\nmelissa_available_end = '13:30'  # 1:30 PM\n\n# Convert time strings to minutes since 9:00\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, mins = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return (hours * 60) + mins\n\nuser_arrival_sunset_district_min = 0  # 9:00 AM is 540 minutes since midnight\nanthony_available_start_min = time_to_minutes('13:15')  # 1:15 PM is 765 minutes\nanthony_available_end_min = time_to_minutes('14:30')  # 2:30 PM is 870 minutes\nrebecca_available_start_min = time_to_minutes('19:30')  # 7:30 PM is 1170 minutes\nrebecca_available_end_min = time_to_minutes('21:15')  # 9:15 PM is 1320 minutes\nmelissa_available_start_min = time_to_minutes('8:15')  # 8:15 AM is 495 minutes\nmelissa_available_end_min = time_to_minutes('13:30')  # 1:30 PM is 810 minutes\n\n# Calculate the latest possible meeting start times\nanthony_min_meeting_time = 60\nanthony_latest_start = anthony_available_end_min -
