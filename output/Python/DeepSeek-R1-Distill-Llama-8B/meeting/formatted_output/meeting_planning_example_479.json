            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to schedule meetings with five friends in San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and each friend's availability. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input parameters. The travel times are provided between locations like Embarcadero, Golden Gate Park, Haight-Ashbury, Bayview, Presidio, and Financial District. Each friend has specific time slots and minimum meeting durations.\n\nI arrive at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. The friends' availability is:\n\n- **Mary**: Golden Gate Park from 8:45 AM to 11:45 AM, needs 45 minutes.\n- **Kevin**: Haight-Ashbury from 10:15 AM to 4:15 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n- **Deborah**: Bayview from 3:00 PM to 7:15 PM, needs 120 minutes.\n- **Stephanie**: Presidio from 10:00 AM to 5:15 PM, needs 120 minutes.\n- **Emily**: Financial District from 11:30 AM to 9:45 PM, needs 105 minutes.\n\nI need to create a schedule that includes as many of these meetings as possible without overlapping and considering travel times.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: Each friend has specific availability and minimum meeting duration.\n2. **Calculate Travel Times**: Use the provided distances to determine the time needed to travel between locations.\n3. **Generate Possible Meetings**: For each friend, determine possible meeting times that fit within their availability and travel time from the starting location.\n4. **Schedule Meetings**: Prioritize scheduling the earliest possible meetings to maximize the number of meetings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    # From Embarcadero (EB)\n    \"EB\": {\n        \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\": 25,\n        \"Haight-Ashbury (HA)\": 21,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 21,\n        \"Presidio (PR)\": 20,\n        \"Financial District (FD)\": 5,\n    },\n    # From Golden Gate Park (GGP)\n    \"GGP\": {\n        \"Embarcadero (EB)\": 25,\n        \"Haight-Ashbury (HA)\": 7,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 23,\n        \"Presidio (PR)\": 11,\n        \"Financial District (FD)\": 26,\n    },\n    # From Haight-Ashbury (HA)\n    \"HA\": {\n        \"Embarcadero (EB)\": 20,\n        \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\": 7,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 19,\n        \"Presidio (PR)\": 15,\n        \"Financial District (FD)\": 21,\n    },\n    # From Bayview (BV)\n    \"BV\": {\n        \"Embarcadero (EB)\": 19,\n        \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\": 22,\n        \"Haight-Ashbury (HA)\": 19,\n        \"Presidio (PR)\": 31,\n        \"Financial District (FD)\": 19,\n    },\n    # From Presidio (PR)\n    \"PR\": {\n        \"Embarcadero (EB)\": 20,\n        \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\": 12,\n        \"Haight-Ashbury (HA)\": 15,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 31,\n        \"Financial District (FD)\": 23,\n    },\n    # From Financial District (FD)\n    \"FD\": {\n        \"Embarcadero (EB)\": 4,\n        \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\": 23,\n        \"Haight-Ashbury (HA)\": 19,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 19,\n        \"Presidio (PR)\": 22,\n    },\n}\n\n# Read constraints\nconstraints = {\n    \"Mary\": {\n        \"start\": \"8:45\",\n        \"end\": \"11:45\",\n        \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\",\n        \"duration\": 45,\n    },\n    \"Kevin\": {\n        \"start\": \"10:15\",\n        \"end\": \"16:15\",\n        \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury (HA)\",\n        \"duration\": 90,\n    },\n    \"Deborah\": {\n        \"start\": \"15:00\",\n        \"end\": \"19:15\",\n        \"location\": \"Bayview (BV)\",\n        \"duration\": 120,\n    },\n    \"Stephanie\": {\n        \"start\": \"10:00\",\n        \"end\": \"17:15\",\n        \"location\": \"Presidio (PR)\",\n        \"duration\": 120,\n    },\n    \"Emily\": {\n        \"start\": \"11:30\",\n        \"end\": \"21:45\",\n        \"location\": \"Financial District (FD)\",\n        \"duration\": 105,\n    },\n}\n\n# Starting location is Embarcadero (EB) at 9:00 AM\nstart_time = \"9:00\"\n\ndef compute_schedule():\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    import itertools\n\n    # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    def time_to_min(t):\n        h, m = map(int, t.split(':'))\n        return h * 60 + m\n\n    def min_to_time(m):\n        hours = m // 60\n        minutes = m % 60\n        return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n    # Convert all constraints to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    constraintsConvert = {}\n    for name, constr in constraints.items():\n        start = time_to_min(constr[\"start\"])\n        end = time_to_min(constr[\"end\"])\n        constraintsConvert[name] = {\n            \"start\": start,\n            \"end\": end,\n            \"location\": constr[\"location\"],\n            \"duration\": constr[\"duration\"],\n        }\n\n    locations = [\"EB\", \"GGP\", \"HA\", \"BV\", \"PR\", \"FD\"]\n\n    # Generate possible meeting times for each person\n    possible_meetings = {}\n\n    for person in constraintsConvert:\n        person_constraints = constraintsConvert[person]\n        possible_meetings[person] = []\n        for loc in locations:\n            if loc == person_constraints[\"location\"]:\n                continue\n            travel_time = travel_times[f\"{loc} to {person_constraints['location']}\"]\n            earliest_meet = person_constraints[\"start\"] + travel_time\n            latest_meet = person_constraints[\"end\"] -
