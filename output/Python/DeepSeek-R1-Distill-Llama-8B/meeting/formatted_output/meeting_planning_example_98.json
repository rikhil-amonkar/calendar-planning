            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to schedule a meeting with Timothy in San Francisco. The goal is to meet him for at least 45 minutes, considering the travel times and his availability.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input parameters. The travel times are provided between Alamo Square and Richmond District. Each has a one-way travel time: 12 minutes from Alamo Square to Richmond District and 13 minutes from Richmond District to Alamo Square.\n\nTimothy's availability is from 8:45 PM to 9:30 PM at Richmond District. I arrive at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM. I need to meet him for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: Timothy is available from 8:45 PM to 9:30 PM. I need to meet him for at least 45 minutes.\n2. **Calculate Travel Times**: The travel time from Alamo Square to Richmond District is 12 minutes.\n3. **Determine Possible Meeting Times**: I can leave Alamo Square at 9:00 AM and travel to Richmond District, arriving at 9:12 AM. However, Timothy isn't available until 8:45 PM. I need to see if I can meet him that evening.\n4. **Check Feasibility**: The latest I can leave Alamo Square to reach Richmond District by 8:45 PM is 8:45 PM minus 12 minutes, which is 8:33 PM. But I arrive at 9:00 AM, so I can't realistically meet him until the evening.\n5. **Schedule the Meeting**: I'll need to leave Alamo Square by 8:33 PM to arrive by 8:45 PM. But since I arrive at 9:00 AM, I need to see if I can adjust my schedule to meet him.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    \"Alamo Square (AS)\": {\n        \"Richmond District (RD)\": 12,\n    },\n    \"Richmond District (RD)\": {\n        \"Alamo Square (AS)\": 13,\n    },\n}\n\n# Read constraints\nconstraints = {\n    \"Timothy\": {\n        \"start\": \"20:45\",\n        \"end\": \"21:30\",\n        \"location\": \"Richmond District (RD)\",\n        \"duration\": 45,\n    },\n}\n\n# Starting location is Alamo Square (AS) at 9:00 AM\nstart_time = \"9:00\"\n\ndef compute_schedule():\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    import itertools\n\n    # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    def time_to_min(t):\n        h, m = map(int, t.split(':'))\n        return h * 60 + m\n\n    def min_to_time(m):\n        hours = m // 60\n        minutes = m % 60\n        return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n    # Convert all constraints to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    constraintsConvert = {}\n    for name, constr in constraints.items():\n        start = time_to_min(constr[\"start\"])\n        end = time_to_min(constr[\"end\"])\n        constraintsConvert[name] = {\n            \"start\": start,\n            \"end\": end,\n            \"location\": constr[\"location\"],\n            \"duration\": constr[\"duration\"],\n        }\n\n    locations = [\"AS\", \"RD\"]\n\n    # Generate possible meeting times for each person\n    possible_meetings = {}\n\n    for person in constraintsConvert:\n        person_constraints = constraintsConvert[person]\n        possible_meetings[person] = []\n        for loc in locations:\n            if loc == person_constraints[\"location\"]:\n                continue\n            travel_time = travel_times[f\"{loc} to {person_constraints['location']}\"]\n            earliest_meet = person_constraints[\"start\"] + travel_time\n            latest_meet = person_constraints[\"end\"] -
