            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to schedule meetings with five friends in San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and each friend's availability. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input parameters. The travel times are provided between locations like The Castro, Bayview, Pacific Heights, Alamo Square, Fisherman's Wharf, and Golden Gate Park. Each friend has specific time slots and minimum meeting durations.\n\nI arrive at The Castro at 9:00 AM. The friends' availability is:\n\n- **Rebecca**: Bayview from 9:00 AM to 12:45 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n- **Amanda**: Pacific Heights from 6:30 PM to 9:45 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n- **James**: Alamo Square from 9:45 AM to 9:15 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n- **Sarah**: Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00 AM to 9:30 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n- **Melissa**: Golden Gate Park from 9:00 AM to 6:45 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n\nI need to create a schedule that includes as many of these meetings as possible without overlapping and considering travel times.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: Each friend has specific availability and minimum meeting duration.\n2. **Calculate Travel Times**: Use the provided distances to determine the time needed to travel between locations.\n3. **Generate Possible Meetings**: For each friend, determine possible meeting times that fit within their availability and travel time from the starting location.\n4. **Schedule Meetings**: Prioritize scheduling the earliest possible meetings to maximize the number of meetings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    # From The Castro (TC)\n    \"TC\": {\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 19,\n        \"Pacific Heights (PH)\": 16,\n        \"Alamo Square (AS)\": 8,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 24,\n        \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\": 11,\n    },\n    # From Bayview (BV)\n    \"BV\": {\n        \"The Castro (TC)\": 20,\n        \"Pacific Heights (PH)\": 22,\n        \"Alamo Square (AS)\": 16,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 25,\n        \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\": 22,\n    },\n    # From Pacific Heights (PH)\n    \"PH\": {\n        \"The Castro (TC)\": 16,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 22,\n        \"Alamo Square (AS)\": 10,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 13,\n        \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\": 15,\n    },\n    # From Alamo Square (AS)\n    \"AS\": {\n        \"The Castro (TC)\": 8,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 16,\n        \"Pacific Heights (PH)\": 10,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 19,\n        \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\": 9,\n    },\n    # From Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\n    \"FW\": {\n        \"The Castro (TC)\": 26,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 26,\n        \"Pacific Heights (PH)\": 12,\n        \"Alamo Square (AS)\": 20,\n        \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\": 25,\n    },\n    # From Golden Gate Park (GGP)\n    \"GGP\": {\n        \"The Castro (TC)\": 13,\n        \"Bayview (BV)\": 23,\n        \"Pacific Heights (PH)\": 16,\n        \"Alamo Square (AS)\": 10,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 24,\n    },\n}\n\n# Read constraints\nconstraints = {\n    \"Rebecca\": {\n        \"start\": \"9:00\",\n        \"end\": \"12:45\",\n        \"location\": \"Bayview (BV)\",\n        \"duration\": 90,\n    },\n    \"Amanda\": {\n        \"start\": \"18:30\",\n        \"end\": \"21:45\",\n        \"location\": \"Pacific Heights (PH)\",\n        \"duration\": 90,\n    },\n    \"James\": {\n        \"start\": \"9:45\",\n        \"end\": \"21:15\",\n        \"location\": \"Alamo Square (AS)\",\n        \"duration\": 90,\n    },\n    \"Sarah\": {\n        \"start\": \"8:00\",\n        \"end\": \"21:30\",\n        \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\",\n        \"duration\": 90,\n    },\n    \"Melissa\": {\n        \"start\": \"9:00\",\n        \"end\": \"18:45\",\n        \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park (GGP)\",\n        \"duration\": 90,\n    },\n}\n\n# Starting location is The Castro (TC) at 9:00 AM\nstart_time = \"9:00\"\n\ndef compute_schedule():\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    import itertools\n\n    # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    def time_to_min(t):\n        h, m = map(int, t.split(':'))\n        return h * 60 + m\n\n    def min_to_time(m):\n        hours = m // 60\n        minutes = m % 60\n        return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n    # Convert all constraints to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    constraintsConvert = {}\n    for name, constr in constraints.items():\n        start = time_to_min(constr[\"start\"])\n        end = time_to_min(constr[\"end\"])\n        constraintsConvert[name] = {\n            \"start\": start,\n            \"end\": end,\n            \"location\": constr[\"location\"],\n            \"duration\": constr[\"duration\"],\n        }\n\n    locations = [\"TC\", \"BV\", \"PH\", \"AS\", \"FW\", \"GGP\"]\n\n    # Generate possible meeting times for each person\n    possible_meetings = {}\n\n    for person in constraintsConvert:\n        person_constraints = constraintsConvert[person]\n        possible_meetings[person] = []\n        for loc in locations:\n            if loc == person_constraints[\"location\"]:\n                continue\n            travel_time = travel_times[f\"{loc} to {person_constraints['location']}\"]\n            earliest_meet = person_constraints[\"start\"] + travel_time\n            latest_meet = person_constraints[\"end\"] -
