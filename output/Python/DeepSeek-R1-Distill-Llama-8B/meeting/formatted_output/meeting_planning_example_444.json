            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to plan an optimal meeting schedule in San Francisco for the user. They want to meet as many friends as possible, but each friend has specific time constraints and location preferences. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping and considering the travel times between locations.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the input parameters. There are travel distances between various locations like Financial District, Russian Hill, Sunset District, etc. Each person has a specific time window when they're available and the minimum duration they're willing to meet.\n\nThe user arrives at Financial District at 9:00 AM. So, all meetings must start after this time. The friends available are Ronald, Patricia, Laura, Emily, and Mary, each with their own time slots and meeting duration requirements.\n\nMy task is to write a Python program that takes these constraints and computes the optimal schedule. The program should output a JSON-formatted itinerary with the meeting details.\n\nI think the first step is to convert all the times into minutes since 9:00 AM for easier calculations. This way, I can handle the time differences more straightforwardly.\n\nNext, I need to determine the optimal order of meetings. I should start with the friend who has the earliest availability or the one who can be met first without causing too many travel delays. Maybe Patricia, who's available from 9:15 AM, is a good starting point since she's early in the day.\n\nAfter meeting Patricia, I need to decide where to go next. The next logical place might be Sunset District because it's a central location that connects well with other areas. From there, I can travel to other spots like Golden Gate Park or The Castro.\n\nI also need to consider the meeting durations and travel times. Each meeting should be scheduled such that the user arrives on time and has enough time to travel to the next location without being late.\n\nFor example, if the user meets Patricia at Sunset District at 9:30 AM, they'll need to travel to Golden Gate Park next. The travel time from Sunset District to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes, so they can arrive by 9:41 AM. Meeting Mary there until 10:10 AM makes sense.\n\nThen, from Golden Gate Park, the user can travel to North Beach, which takes 24 minutes, arriving at 10:25 AM. Meeting Laura there for 15 minutes until 10:40 AM is feasible.\n\nAfter that, traveling to The Castro takes 22 minutes, arriving at 10:57 AM. Meeting Emily there until 12:17 PM is possible, but I need to check if this fits within Emily's availability, which is from 4:15 PM to 6:30 PM. Wait, that doesn't fit. So, maybe I need to adjust the schedule.\n\nPerhaps instead of going to The Castro next, the user should go to Russian Hill after North Beach. The travel time from North Beach to Russian Hill is 5 minutes, arriving at 11:02 AM. Meeting Ronald there from 11:02 AM to 12:47 PM would work, as he's available until 5:15 PM.\n\nThen, from Russian Hill, the user can travel to Financial District, taking 11 minutes, arriving at 12:58 PM. Meeting Patricia again here isn't possible because she's already met. Maybe the next best option is to go to The Castro from Russian Hill, which takes 21 minutes, arriving at 1:19 PM. Meeting Emily there from 1:19 PM to 2:19 PM fits within her availability.\n\nFinally, from The Castro, the user can travel back to Financial District, which takes 20 minutes, arriving at 2:39 PM. This allows the user to end their day after meeting as many friends as possible.\n\nI need to make sure all the times add up correctly, considering both the meeting durations and travel times. Also, the final schedule should include all the necessary actions, like traveling and meeting each person.\n\nI'll structure the itinerary by listing each action, whether it's a meeting or a travel, with the respective locations, times, and persons involved. The output should be in JSON format as specified.\n\nI should also ensure that the times are correctly converted to 24-hour format and that the travel times are accurately accounted for to avoid any delays or overlaps.\n\nAfter planning the meetings in the optimal order, I'll convert the itinerary into the required JSON structure and ensure the program runs independently, providing the correct output when executed.\n</think>\n\n```python\n# Define the travel times between locations\ntravel_times = {\n    'FD to RH': 10,\n    'FD to SD': 31,\n    'FD to NB': 7,\n    'FD to TC': 23,\n    'FD to GG Park': 23,\n    'RH to FD': 11,\n    'RH to SD': 23,\n    'RH to NB': 5,\n    'RH to TC': 21,\n    'RH to GG Park': 21,\n    'SD to FD': 30,\n    'SD to RH': 24,\n    'SD to NB': 29,\n    'SD to TC': 17,\n    'SD to GG Park': 11,\n    'NB to FD': 8,\n    'NB to RH': 4,\n    'NB to SD': 27,\n    'NB to TC': 22,\n    'NB to GG Park': 22,\n    'TC to FD': 20,\n    'TC to RH': 18,\n    'TC to SD': 17,\n    'TC to NB': 20,\n    'TC to GG Park': 11,\n    'GG Park to FD': 26,\n    'GG Park to RH': 19,\n    'GG Park to SD': 10,\n    'GG Park to NB': 24,\n    'GG Park to TC': 13\n}\n\n# Define the availability and required times for each person\nconstraints = {\n    'patricia': {'start': '9:15', 'end': '22:00', 'duration': 60},\n    'ronald': {'start': '13:45', 'end': '17:15', 'duration': 105},\n    'laura': {'start': '12:30', 'end': '12:45', 'duration': 15},\n    'emily': {'start': '16:15', 'end': '19:30', 'duration': 60},\n    'mary': {'start': '15:00', 'end': '16:30', 'duration': 60}\n}\n\n# Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM for easier calculations\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    h, m = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return h * 60 + m\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    h = minutes // 60\n    m = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n\n# Convert all times to minutes\nstart_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 AM\navailable_times = {\n    'patricia': {'start_min': 9 * 60 + 15, 'end_min': 22 * 60},\n    'ronald': {'start_min': 13 * 60 + 45, 'end_min': 17 * 60 + 15},\n    'laura': {'start_min': 12 * 60 + 30, 'end_min': 12 * 60 + 45},\n    'emily': {'start_min': 16 * 60 + 15, 'end_min': 19 * 60 + 30},\n    'mary': {'start_min': 15 * 60, 'end_min': 16 * 60 + 30}\n}\n\n# Function to calculate the latest possible departure time to arrive on time\ndef calculate_departure(arrival_time, meeting_time):\n    return arrival_time -
