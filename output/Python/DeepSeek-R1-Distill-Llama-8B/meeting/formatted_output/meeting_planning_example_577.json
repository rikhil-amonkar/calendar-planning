            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help this person write a Python program to schedule meetings in San Francisco. They want to meet as many friends as possible, starting from Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. There are several people with specific locations, availability windows, and required meeting durations. The goal is to find the optimal schedule that maximizes the number of meetings without overlapping times, considering travel times between locations.\n\nFirst, I'll need to structure the problem. The main steps are:\n\n1. **Input Data**: Define the travel times between Haight-Ashbury and all other locations. Each person has their location, availability start and end times, required meeting duration, and the travel time from Haight-Ashbury to their location.\n\n2. **Feasibility Check**: For each person, determine if there's a feasible time to meet based on their availability and the travel time. This involves calculating the earliest and latest possible start times for each meeting.\n\n3. **Sorting Meetings**: Once feasible times are determined, sort these meetings by their end times. This helps in selecting the earliest ending meetings first, which is a greedy approach to maximize the number of non-overlapping meetings.\n\n4. **Selecting Non-overlapping Meetings**: Using a greedy algorithm, select the first feasible meeting, then the next one that doesn't overlap with the current one, and so on.\n\n5. **Output**: Format the selected meetings into a JSON structure as specified.\n\nNow, I'll think about how to implement each step in code.\n\n**Step 1: Define Travel Times**\n\nI'll create a dictionary where each key is a location, and the value is another dictionary mapping other locations to their respective travel times. For example, Haight-Ashbury to Russian Hill is 17 minutes.\n\n**Step 2: Process Each Person**\n\nFor each person, extract their location, availability window, required duration, and travel time. Convert the availability window to minutes since 9 AM to make calculations easier. Calculate the earliest possible start time (9 AM or their start time, whichever is later) and the latest possible end time (their end time minus the duration). If the earliest start is after the latest end, skip this person.\n\n**Step 3: Sort Meetings**\n\nAfter collecting all feasible meetings, sort them by their end times. This helps in choosing the earliest ending meetings first, which allows more meetings to be scheduled later.\n\n**Step 4: Select Meetings**\n\nIterate through the sorted meetings, adding each to the itinerary if it doesn't overlap with the last added meeting. This ensures that we maximize the number of meetings.\n\n**Step 5: Format Output**\n\nConvert the start and end times from minutes back to HH:MM format and structure the output as a JSON dictionary.\n\nPotential issues to consider:\n\n- **Time Conversion**: Converting times to minutes since 9 AM might cause confusion. Need to ensure that times are correctly converted and that the earliest start is at least 9 AM.\n\n- **Feasibility Check**: Ensure that for each person, the earliest start time is after 9 AM and that the latest start time is before their end time minus the meeting duration.\n\n- **Sorting and Selection**: The sorting by end time is crucial for the greedy approach to work correctly.\n\n- **Edge Cases**: Some people might have overlapping windows that don't allow any meetings, or only one meeting can be scheduled.\n\nTesting the code with sample data might help identify any issues. For example, if a person's availability window is entirely before 9 AM or ends before 9 AM, they can't be met. Similarly, if their window is too short for the required duration, they can't be accommodated.\n\nFinally, the code must run independently and output valid JSON without any additional text or explanations, as per the problem statement.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Define travel times from Haight-Ashbury to each location\ntravel_times = {\n    'Haight-Ashbury': {\n        'Russian Hill': 17,\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 23,\n        'Nob Hill': 15,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 7,\n        'Alamo Square': 5,\n        'Pacific Heights': 12\n    },\n    'Russian Hill': {\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 17,\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 7,\n        'Nob Hill': 5,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 21,\n        'Alamo Square': 15,\n        'Pacific Heights': 7\n    },\n    'Fisherman's Wharf': {\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 22,\n        'Russian Hill': 7,\n        'Nob Hill': 11,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 25,\n        'Alamo Square': 20,\n        'Pacific Heights': 12\n    },\n    'Nob Hill': {\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 13,\n        'Russian Hill': 5,\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 11,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 17,\n        'Alamo Square': 11,\n        'Pacific Heights': 8\n    },\n    'Golden Gate Park': {\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 7,\n        'Russian Hill': 19,\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 24,\n        'Nob Hill': 20,\n        'Alamo Square': 10,\n        'Pacific Heights': 16\n    },\n    'Alamo Square': {\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 5,\n        'Russian Hill': 13,\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 19,\n        'Nob Hill': 11,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 9,\n        'Pacific Heights': 10\n    },\n    'Pacific Heights': {\n        'Haight-Ashbury': 11,\n        'Russian Hill': 7,\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 13,\n        'Nob Hill': 8,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 15,\n        'Alamo Square': 10\n    }\n}\n\n# List of people with their details\npeople = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Stephanie',\n        'location': 'Russian Hill',\n        'start_time': '8:00',\n        'end_time': '8:45',\n        'duration': 15,\n        'travel_time': 17\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Kevin',\n        'location': 'Fisherman's Wharf',\n        'start_time': '7:15',\n        'end_time': '9:45',\n        'duration': 75,\n        'travel_time': 23\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Robert',\n        'location': 'Nob Hill',\n        'start_time': '7:45',\n        'end_time': '10:30',\n        'duration': 90,\n        'travel_time': 15\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Steven',\n        'location': 'Golden Gate Park',\n        'start_time': '8:30',\n        'end_time': '5:00',\n        'duration': 75,\n        'travel_time': 7\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Anthony',\n        'location': 'Alamo Square',\n        'start_time': '7:45',\n        'end_time': '7:45',\n        'duration': 15,\n        'travel_time': 5\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Sandra',\n        'location': 'Pacific Heights',\n        'start_time': '2:45',\n        'end_time': '9:45',\n        'duration': 45,\n        'travel_time': 12\n    }\n]\n\n# Function to calculate feasible meeting times\ndef calculate_feasible_meetings(people, travel_times):\n    meetings = []\n    for person in people:\n        location = person['location']\n        start_time = person['start_time']\n        end_time = person['end_time']\n        duration = person['duration']\n        travel_time = travel_times['Haight-Ashbury'][location]\n        \n        # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n        earliest_start_min = (int(start_time.replace(':', '')) * 60) + 540  # 9:00 AM in minutes\n        latest_start_min = (int(end_time.replace(':', '')) * 60) -
