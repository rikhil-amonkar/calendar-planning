            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create an optimal meeting schedule for the day in San Francisco. The user provided a bunch of travel distances between different locations and a set of constraints for meeting various friends. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, starting from Embarcadero at 9:00 AM.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The user can meet each friend at specific times and for a minimum duration. The challenge is to find a schedule that fits all these constraints without overlapping meeting times, considering the travel times between locations.\n\nI think the approach here is to model this as a graph problem where each location is a node, and the travel times are the edges. Then, for each friend, determine the possible times they can be met based on their availability and the required meeting duration. After that, find a sequence of meetings that starts from Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, respects all travel times, and meets as many friends as possible.\n\nI'll start by listing out all the friends and their available time windows and meeting durations. Then, for each friend, calculate the latest and earliest possible start times for a meeting. After that, I'll check if it's feasible to meet each friend given the travel times and the times they're available.\n\nMaybe I should try meeting each friend one by one, starting with the one who has the earliest availability. For example, Stephanie is available from 7:30 AM to 10:15 AM, which is earlier than others. Meeting her first might be a good start. Then, after returning from her meeting, I can check if I can meet others.\n\nWait, but the user arrives at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. So, the earliest I can leave for a meeting is after 9:00 AM. For Stephanie, her availability starts at 7:30 AM, but I can't get there before 9:00 AM. So, the latest I can meet her is by 10:15 AM. Since her meeting requires 60 minutes, I need to arrive by 9:45 AM to meet her until 10:45 AM, but she's only available until 10:15 AM. So, I need to adjust the meeting time.\n\nHmm, maybe I should calculate the exact arrival and departure times for each meeting, considering the travel times. For example, if I leave Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, it takes 10 minutes to get to Nob Hill. So, I can meet Jessica at Nob Hill from 9:10 AM to 11:10 AM, but her availability is from 4:30 PM to 6:45 PM. That doesn't work. So, I need to meet her later.\n\nI think I need to iterate through each possible friend, calculate the earliest and latest meeting times, and then check if the travel times allow me to meet them without overlapping with others. It might be a bit complex, but I can represent the locations as nodes and the travel times as edges, then use some kind of scheduling algorithm to find the optimal path.\n\nAlternatively, since the user wants to meet as many friends as possible, maybe I should prioritize meeting friends whose time windows are earliest and require the least duration first. That way, I can maximize the number of meetings.\n\nI also need to consider that some friends might be in locations that require longer travel times, so I have to factor that into the schedule. For example, meeting someone in the Marina District might take longer, so I need to plan the meetings in an order that minimizes backtracking.\n\nWait, the user starts at Embarcadero, so all meetings should start from there or after. I should make sure that each meeting's start time is after the previous meeting's end time, considering the travel times.\n\nI think the best approach is to model this as a graph where each node is a location and each edge is the travel time between them. Then, for each friend, create possible meeting times based on their availability and required duration. After that, use a backtracking algorithm to find the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings that fit within the day.\n\nBut since this is a Python program, I need to implement this logic step by step. Maybe I can represent the locations as a dictionary with their names and travel times. Then, for each friend, calculate their possible meeting windows and check if they can be met given the travel times.\n\nI should also consider that some friends might have overlapping time windows, so I need to find a way to schedule them without conflicts. Perhaps I can use a greedy algorithm, trying to meet the friend who becomes available earliest next, but I'm not sure if that's optimal.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a recursive approach where I try to meet each friend one by one, and if it's possible, proceed to the next. If not, backtrack and try a different meeting time.\n\nBut implementing a recursive solution might be complex, so maybe a better approach is to generate all possible meeting sequences and select the one that maximizes the number of meetings. However, that could be computationally intensive.\n\nI think for this problem, since there are only a few friends, a backtracking approach might be feasible. I'll start by trying to meet each friend, calculate the travel times, and see if the next friend can be met afterward.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Create a dictionary of travel times between all locations.\n2. For each friend, determine their available time window and required meeting duration.\n3. For each friend, calculate the latest possible start time and earliest possible start time for a meeting.\n4. Attempt to meet each friend, considering the travel times and their availability.\n5. If a meeting is possible, record the time and then proceed to meet the next friend.\n6. If all friends are met, output the itinerary.\n7. If not, try the next possible meeting time and repeat.\n\nI need to make sure that each meeting's start time is after the previous meeting's end time, considering the travel times. Also, the meeting must fit within the friend's availability window.\n\nI'll start by trying to meet the earliest available friend. For example, Stephanie is available from 7:30 AM to 10:15 AM. Since the user arrives at 9:00 AM, the latest they can meet Stephanie is by 10:15 AM. Meeting her requires 60 minutes, so the meeting must end by 10:15 AM, meaning they need to arrive by 9:45 AM.\n\nCalculating the travel time from Embarcadero to The Castro, which is 25 minutes. So, they can leave Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, arrive at 9:25 AM, meet Stephanie until 10:25 AM, but she's only available until 10:15 AM. So, the meeting must end by 10:15 AM, meaning they need to arrive by 9:55 AM. Therefore, they should leave Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, arrive at 9:25 AM, meet from 9:25 AM to 10:25 AM, but since she's only available until 10:15, they need to adjust.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the exact arrival and departure times. If they leave Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, it takes 25 minutes to reach The Castro, arriving at 9:25 AM. They can meet Stephanie from 9:25 AM to 10:25 AM, but she's only available until 10:15 AM. So, the meeting must end by 10:15 AM, meaning they need to arrive by 9:55 AM. Therefore, they should leave Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, arrive at 9:25 AM, but wait until 9:55 AM to start the meeting, ending at 10:15 AM. Then, they need to leave The Castro at 10:15 AM to return to Embarcadero, taking 25 minutes, arriving back at 10:40 AM.\n\nAfter meeting Stephanie, the user can proceed to meet other friends. For example, the next earliest available friend might be Thomas, who is at Fisherman's Wharf from 1:30 PM to 7:00 PM. The user arrives back at Embarcadero at 10:40 AM, so they can leave for Fisherman's Wharf after that. The travel time from Embarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf is 8 minutes. So, they can leave at 10:40 AM, arrive at 10:48 AM. They can meet Thomas from 10:48 AM to 11:48 AM, which is within his availability. After that, they need to leave Fisherman's Wharf to return to Embarcadero, taking 8 minutes, arriving back at 11:56 AM.\n\nThen, the user can try to meet another friend. Looking at the constraints, Nancy is available from 2:45 PM to 8:00 PM. The user arrives back at Embarcadero at 11:56 AM, so they can leave for North Beach, which takes 6 minutes. They can leave at 12:00 PM, arrive at 12:06 PM. Nancy's availability starts at 2:45 PM, so the user needs to meet her after that. After meeting Nancy, they can return to Embarcadero, taking 6 minutes, arriving at 12:12 PM.\n\nContinuing this process, the user can try to meet other friends, ensuring that each meeting's start time is after the previous meeting's end time and fits within the friend's availability. This way, the user can maximize the number of meetings throughout the day.\n\nI think the key is to systematically check each possible meeting time, considering the travel times and constraints, and find the optimal sequence that allows meeting the maximum number of friends. This might involve some trial and error, trying different orders and times, but with a structured approach, it's manageable.\n\nAnother consideration is that some friends might require longer travel times, so it's important to plan meetings in an order that minimizes the total travel distance and time. For example, meeting someone in the Marina District might be more efficient if done later in the day after other meetings.\n\nOverall, the solution involves calculating possible meeting times for each friend, ensuring they fit within the availability windows, and then selecting the best possible sequence that maximizes the number of meetings without overlapping times. This requires careful calculation and checking of each possibility.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import time, timedelta\n\n# Define travel distances between locations\ndistance = {\n
