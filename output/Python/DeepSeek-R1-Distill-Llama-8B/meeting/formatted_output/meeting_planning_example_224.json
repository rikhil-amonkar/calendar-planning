            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to write a Python program that helps me figure out the best schedule for meeting as many friends as possible in San Francisco. I've been given a set of travel distances between different locations and some specific constraints for each person I want to meet. My goal is to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping times, considering both the travel times and each person's availability.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input data. There are travel distances from Fisherman's Wharf to various places like Golden Gate Park, Presidio, Richmond District, and so on. Each of these distances is in minutes. Then, there are constraints where each friend will be available at specific locations during certain times, and I need to meet them for a minimum duration.\n\nI think the approach should involve calculating the feasible meeting times for each person based on their availability and the travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to their location. Once I have all feasible times, I need to select the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings.\n\nSo, the steps I need to follow are:\n\n1. **Read and Store Travel Times**: I'll create a dictionary where each location has the travel time to other locations from Fisherman's Wharf.\n\n2. **Define Each Person's Details**: For each person, I'll note their location, availability start and end times, duration they're available to meet, and the travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to their location.\n\n3. **Calculate Feasible Meeting Times**: For each person, I'll determine the earliest and latest possible times I can meet them based on their availability and travel time. This will give me a window during which a meeting is possible.\n\n4. **Sort Meetings by End Time**: To maximize the number of meetings, I'll sort these feasible meeting times by their end times. This allows me to pick the earliest ending meeting first, which leaves more time for subsequent meetings.\n\n5. **Select Non-Overlapping Meetings**: Using a greedy algorithm, I'll select the next compatible meeting that doesn't overlap with the previously selected ones.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Finally, I'll format the selected meetings into the required JSON structure, converting times into the correct 24-hour format.\n\nI also need to make sure that the program runs independently and doesn't rely on any external data except what's provided in the input. The output should be a valid JSON file that can be generated when the program is executed.\n\nNow, I'll start by defining the travel times in the code. I'll create a nested dictionary where each key is a location, and the value is another dictionary containing travel times to all other locations from that key.\n\nNext, I'll define each person with their details. Each person will be a dictionary with their name, location, availability start and end times, meeting duration, and travel time.\n\nThen, I'll write a function to calculate feasible meeting times. For each person, I'll convert their availability times into minutes since 9:00 AM. This helps in calculating the earliest and latest possible start times for the meeting, considering the travel time.\n\nAfter calculating feasible times, I'll sort these meetings by their end times. This helps in selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings.\n\nFinally, I'll iterate through the sorted meetings, selecting each one that doesn't overlap with the previously selected meeting. This greedy approach ensures that I maximize the number of meetings.\n\nI'll also need to handle cases where no meeting is possible for a person if their latest possible start time is before their earliest possible start time.\n\nOnce all feasible meetings are selected, I'll format them into the required JSON structure, ensuring the times are correctly converted into 24-hour format strings.\n\nI think this approach covers all the requirements. Now, I'll proceed to write the Python code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Define travel times from Fisherman's Wharf to each location\ntravel_times = {\n    'Fisherman's Wharf': {\n        'Golden Gate Park': 25,\n        'Presidio': 17,\n        'Richmond District': 18,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 24,\n        'Presidio': 19,\n        'Richmond District': 18\n    },\n    'Golden Gate Park': {\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 24,\n        'Presidio': 11,\n        'Richmond District': 7,\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 25,\n        'Presidio': 12,\n        'Richmond District': 9\n    },\n    'Presidio': {\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 17,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 12,\n        'Richmond District': 7,\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 19,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 11,\n        'Richmond District': 7\n    },\n    'Richmond District': {\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 18,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 9,\n        'Presidio': 7,\n        'Fisherman's Wharf': 18,\n        'Golden Gate Park': 7,\n        'Presidio': 7\n    }\n}\n\n# List of people with their details\npeople = [\n    {\n        'name': 'Melissa',\n        'location': 'Golden Gate Park',\n        'start_time': '8:30',\n        'end_time': '8:00',\n        'duration': 15,\n        'travel_time': 25\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Nancy',\n        'location': 'Presidio',\n        'start_time': '7:45',\n        'end_time': '10:00',\n        'duration': 105,\n        'travel_time': 17\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Emily',\n        'location': 'Richmond District',\n        'start_time': '4:45',\n        'end_time': '10:00',\n        'duration': 120,\n        'travel_time': 18\n    }\n]\n\n# Function to calculate feasible meeting times\ndef calculate_feasible_meetings(people, travel_times):\n    meetings = []\n    for person in people:\n        location = person['location']\n        start_time = person['start_time']\n        end_time = person['end_time']\n        duration = person['duration']\n        travel_time = travel_times['Fisherman's Wharf'][location]\n        \n        # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n        earliest_start_min = (int(start_time.replace(':', '')) * 60) + 540  # 9:00 AM in minutes\n        latest_start_min = (int(end_time.replace(':', '')) * 60) - duration\n        \n        # Ensure earliest start is at least 9:00 AM\n        if earliest_start_min < 540:\n            earliest_start_min = 540\n        \n        if latest_start_min < earliest_start_min:\n            continue  # No possible meeting time\n        \n        meetings.append({\n            'name': person['name'],\n            'location': location,\n            'start_time': earliest_start_min,\n            'end_time': latest_start_min\n        })\n    \n    return meetings\n\n# Calculate feasible meeting times\nfeasible_meetings = calculate_feasible_meetings(people, travel_times)\n\n# Sort meetings by end time\nfeasible_meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x['end_time'])\n\n# Select non-overlapping meetings\nitinerary = []\nfor meeting in feasible_meetings:\n    start = meeting['start_time']\n    end = meeting['end_time']\n    if not itinerary or end <= itinerary[-1]['end_time']:\n        itinerary.append(meeting)\n\n# Convert time to 24-hour format strings\nitinerary = [\n    {\n        'action': 'meet',\n        'location': meeting['location'],\n        'person': meeting['name'],\n        'start_time': f\"{meeting['start_time'] // 60 + (meeting['start_time'] % 60 // 10)}:{meeting['start_time'] % 60 // 10 * 10}\",\n        'end_time': f\"{meeting['end_time'] // 60 + (meeting['end_time'] % 60 // 10)}:{meeting['end_time'] % 60 // 10 * 10}\"\n    }\n    for meeting in itinerary\n]\n\n# Generate JSON output\noutput = {\n    \"itinerary\": itinerary\n}\n\nprint(json.dumps(output))\n```",
