            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the optimal meeting schedule for the day in San Francisco. The user has provided travel distances between various locations and constraints for meeting different friends. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, starting from Russian Hill at 9:00 AM.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the friends and their availability:\n\n1. **Mark**: Marina District from 6:45 PM to 9:00 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n2. **Karen**: Financial District from 9:30 AM to 12:45 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n3. **Barbara**: Alamo Square from 10:00 AM to 7:30 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n4. **Nancy**: Golden Gate Park from 4:45 PM to 8:00 PM, needs 105 minutes.\n5. **David**: The Castro from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, needs 120 minutes.\n6. **Linda**: Bayview from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n7. **Kevin**: Sunset District from 10:00 AM to 5:45 PM, needs 120 minutes.\n8. **Matthew**: Haight-Ashbury from 10:15 AM to 3:30 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n9. **Andrew**: Nob Hill from 11:45 AM to 4:45 PM, needs 105 minutes.\n\nI need to start by considering who can be met earliest and who has the most flexible availability. Let's see:\n\n- **Karen** is available from 9:30 AM, which is just after I arrive. She needs 90 minutes.\n- **Barbara** is available from 10:00 AM, which is a bit later but also needs 90 minutes.\n- **David** is available from 9:00 AM, which is perfect, but he needs 120 minutes, which might be tight.\n\nLet me try meeting **Karen** first. She's available starting at 9:30 AM, so I need to leave Russian Hill by 9:30 AM. The travel time from Russian Hill to Financial District is 11 minutes. So I can meet her from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM.\n\nAfter meeting Karen, I'll head to the next location. Maybe **Barbara** at Alamo Square, which is 15 minutes from Financial District. She's available until 7:30 PM, so I can meet her from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM.\n\nFrom Alamo Square, perhaps I can go to **David** at The Castro, which is 8 minutes away. David is available until 6:00 PM, so I can meet him from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM. That gives me 120 minutes with David.\n\nAfter David, I can go to **Nancy** at Golden Gate Park, which is 20 minutes from The Castro. Nancy is available until 8:00 PM, so I can meet her from 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM, which is 105 minutes.\n\nFrom Golden Gate Park, I can head to **Linda** in Bayview, which is 27 minutes away. Linda is available from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM. So I can meet her from 5:30 PM to 7:15 PM, but Linda's latest start is 6:15 PM. So I'll adjust to 6:15 PM to 7:15 PM, which is 60 minutes, but she needs 45 minutes. That works, but I have to make sure I don't exceed her availability.\n\nAfter Linda, I can go to **Mark** in Marina District, which is 27 minutes from Bayview. Mark is available until 9:00 PM, so I can meet him from 7:15 PM to 8:45 PM, but he needs 90 minutes. So that's 7:15 PM to 9:00 PM.\n\nFinally, I can go to **Kevin** in Sunset District, which is 21 minutes from Marina District. Kevin is available until 5:45 PM, but I already met Linda at 7:15 PM, so that's too late. Maybe I should adjust earlier meetings to accommodate more people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meeting **Kevin** earlier would be better. Let me try another approach:\n\nStart with **Karen** at 9:30 AM, then **Barbara** at 11:30 AM, then **David** at 1:30 PM, then **Nancy** at 3:30 PM, then **Linda** at 6:15 PM, then **Mark** at 7:15 PM. But I still can't meet **Kevin** because he's available until 5:45 PM, which is earlier than 7:15 PM.\n\nMaybe I should meet **Kevin** earlier. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Karen at 9:30 AM, I can go to **Kevin** in Sunset District, which is 30 minutes from Financial District. Kevin is available until 5:45 PM, so I can meet him from 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM, which is 120 minutes. Then, I can go to **Barbara** at Alamo Square, 17 minutes away, from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\nBut then I can't meet **David** because he's at The Castro from 9:00 AM, but I already met Kevin. Alternatively, maybe meeting **Kevin** later.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should prioritize the friends who can be met earlier and have shorter durations.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. **Karen** at Financial District from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM.\n2. **Kevin** at Sunset District from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM. Travel time is 30 minutes from Financial District.\n3. **Barbara** at Alamo Square from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Travel time is 17 minutes from Sunset District.\n4. **Nancy** at Golden Gate Park from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Travel time is 11 minutes from Alamo Square.\n5. **David** at The Castro from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Travel time is 8 minutes from Golden Gate Park.\n6. **Linda** at Bayview from 7:00 PM to 7:45 PM. Travel time is 27 minutes from The Castro.\n7. **Mark** at Marina District from 7:45 PM to 8:45 PM. Travel time is 27 minutes from Bayview.\n\nThis way, I meet Karen, Kevin, Barbara, Nancy, David, Linda, and Mark. That's seven friends, which is better than the initial attempt. I think this is the optimal schedule.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import time, timedelta\n\n# Define travel distances between locations\ndistance = {\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Marina
