            "raw_model_response": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I'm trying to schedule meetings with four friends in San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many as possible, considering travel times and each friend's availability. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input parameters. The travel times are provided between locations like Sunset District, Russian Hill, Chinatown, Presidio, and Fisherman's Wharf. Each friend has specific time slots and minimum meeting durations.\n\nI arrive at Sunset District at 9:00 AM. The friends' availability is:\n\n- **William**: Russian Hill from 6:30 PM to 8:45 PM, needs 105 minutes.\n- **Michelle**: Chinatown from 8:15 AM to 2:00 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n- **George**: Presidio from 10:30 AM to 6:45 PM, needs 30 minutes.\n- **Robert**: Fisherman's Wharf from 9:00 AM to 1:45 PM, needs 30 minutes.\n\nI need to create a schedule that includes as many of these meetings as possible without overlapping and considering travel times.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: Each friend has specific availability and minimum meeting duration.\n2. **Calculate Travel Times**: Use the provided distances to determine the time needed to travel between locations.\n3. **Generate Possible Meetings**: For each friend, determine possible meeting times that fit within their availability and travel time from my current location.\n4. **Schedule Meetings**: Prioritize scheduling the earliest possible meetings to maximize the number of meetings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    # From Sunset District (SD)\n    \"SD\": {\n        \"Russian Hill (RH)\": 24,\n        \"Chinatown (CT)\": 30,\n        \"Presidio (PR)\": 16,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 29,\n    },\n    # From Russian Hill (RH)\n    \"RH\": {\n        \"SD\": 23,\n        \"Chinatown (CT)\": 9,\n        \"Presidio (PR)\": 14,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 7,\n    },\n    # From Chinatown (CT)\n    \"CT\": {\n        \"SD\": 29,\n        \"RH\": 7,\n        \"Presidio (PR)\": 19,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 8,\n    },\n    # From Presidio (PR)\n    \"PR\": {\n        \"SD\": 15,\n        \"RH\": 14,\n        \"Chinatown (CT)\": 21,\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\": 19,\n    },\n    # From Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\n    \"FW\": {\n        \"SD\": 27,\n        \"RH\": 7,\n        \"Chinatown (CT)\": 12,\n        \"Presidio (PR)\": 17,\n    },\n}\n\n# Read constraints\nconstraints = {\n    \"William\": {\n        \"start\": \"18:30\",\n        \"end\": \"20:45\",\n        \"location\": \"Russian Hill (RH)\",\n        \"duration\": 105,\n    },\n    \"Michelle\": {\n        \"start\": \"8:15\",\n        \"end\": \"14:00\",\n        \"location\": \"Chinatown (CT)\",\n        \"duration\": 15,\n    },\n    \"George\": {\n        \"start\": \"10:30\",\n        \"end\": \"18:45\",\n        \"location\": \"Presidio (PR)\",\n        \"duration\": 30,\n    },\n    \"Robert\": {\n        \"start\": \"9:00\",\n        \"end\": \"13:45\",\n        \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf (FW)\",\n        \"duration\": 30,\n    },\n}\n\n# Starting location is Sunset District (SD) at 9:00 AM\nstart_time = \"9:00\"\n\ndef compute_schedule():\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    import itertools\n\n    # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    def time_to_min(t):\n        h, m = map(int, t.split(':'))\n        return h * 60 + m\n\n    def min_to_time(m):\n        hours = m // 60\n        minutes = m % 60\n        return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n    # Convert all constraints to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    constraintsConvert = {}\n    for name, constr in constraints.items():\n        start = time_to_min(constr[\"start\"])\n        end = time_to_min(constr[\"end\"])\n        constraintsConvert[name] = {\n            \"start\": start,\n            \"end\": end,\n            \"location\": constr[\"location\"],\n            \"duration\": constr[\"duration\"],\n        }\n\n    locations = [\"SD\", \"RH\", \"CT\", \"PR\", \"FW\"]\n\n    # Generate possible meeting times for each person\n    possible_meetings = {}\n\n    for person in constraintsConvert:\n        person_constraints = constraintsConvert[person]\n        possible_meetings[person] = []\n        for loc in locations:\n            if loc == person_constraints[\"location\"]:\n                continue\n            travel_time = travel_times[f\"{loc} to {person_constraints['location']}\"]\n            earliest_meet = person_constraints[\"start\"] + travel_time\n            latest_meet = person_constraints[\"end\"] -
