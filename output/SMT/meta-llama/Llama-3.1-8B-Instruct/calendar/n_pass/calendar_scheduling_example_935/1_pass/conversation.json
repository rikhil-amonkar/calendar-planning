You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Terry and Frances for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nTerry is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Friday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nFrances has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 11:00 to 12:30, 14:30 to 17:00, Friday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFrances would like to avoid more meetings on Tuesday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The solution is printed in the required format. Note that the program assumes that the meeting duration is 30 minutes. If the meeting duration is different, you need to adjust the program accordingly."
