You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Adam and Roy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAdam is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nRoy is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The function uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies the constraints. The solution is then formatted as a string and returned.\n\nThe code also defines the schedules for Adam and Roy, the meeting duration, and schedules the meeting using the `schedule_meeting` function.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the meeting duration is in minutes and that the start and end times are in 24-hour format. The code also assumes that the schedules are represented as lists of tuples, where each tuple represents a time interval."
