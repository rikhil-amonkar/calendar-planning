You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Susan and Sandra for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nSusan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:30; \nSandra has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00; \n\nSusan would rather not meet on Tuesday. Sandra can not meet on Monday after 16:00. Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The solution will be in the format \"Day: <day>, Start Time: <HH:MM>, End Time: <HH:MM>\". \n\nAlso note that the code is quite complex and it's not easy to read or understand. The complexity comes from the fact that we are using a SAT solver to find a solution, and we need to encode the constraints of the problem in a way that the solver can understand. \n\nThe code uses the Z3 library, which is a powerful SAT solver. The solver takes a set of constraints as input, and returns a solution if one exists. The constraints are encoded in a way that the solver can understand, using the `solver.add` method. \n\nThe `d_to_int` function is used to convert the day of the week from a string to an integer, which is what the solver expects. \n\nThe code also includes some comments to explain what each part of the code does."
