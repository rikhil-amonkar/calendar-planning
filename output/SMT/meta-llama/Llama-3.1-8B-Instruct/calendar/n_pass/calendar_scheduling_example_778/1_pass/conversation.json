You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Susan and Sandra for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nSusan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:30; \nSandra has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00; \n\nSusan would rather not meet on Tuesday. Sandra can not meet on Monday after 16:00. Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then creates a Z3 solver and defines the variables and constraints. The constraints check if the meeting duration fits within the available time slots for both Susan and Sandra, and if the day is preferred. Finally, it checks if a solution exists and prints the result."
