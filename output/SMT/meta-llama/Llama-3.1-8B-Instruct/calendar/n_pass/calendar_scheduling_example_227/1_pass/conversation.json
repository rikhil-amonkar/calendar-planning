You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Natalie, David, Douglas, Ralph and Jordan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nNatalie's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nDavid is busy on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nDouglas has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nRalph has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nJordan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nDavid do not want to meet on Monday before 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first creates variables for start and end times for each participant, and then adds constraints for each time slot. It then creates variables for the meeting start and end times, and adds constraints for the meeting duration and each participant's schedule. Finally, it adds constraints for any preferences specified. If a solution is found, it returns a string with the day, start time, and end time of the meeting."
