You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Natalie and William for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nNatalie is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 11:00 to 11:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Thursday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nWilliam is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then converts the schedules to a format that can be used by the Z3 solver. The Z3 solver is then defined, and the variables and constraints are defined. The constraints include the day, start and end times, and the existing schedules for Natalie and William. The code then checks if there is a solution, and if so, it prints the solution. If not, it prints a message indicating that no solution was found."
