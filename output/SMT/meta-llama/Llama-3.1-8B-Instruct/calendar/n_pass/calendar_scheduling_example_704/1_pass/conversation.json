You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Larry and Samuel for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nLarry's calendar is wide open the entire week.\nSamuel has meetings on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00; \n\nLarry would rather not meet on Wednesday. Samuel would like to avoid more meetings on Tuesday. The group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the days, start time, and end time as Z3 integers, then adds constraints for each day and time slot based on the schedules and preferences. It also adds constraints for Larry's and Samuel's preferences. Finally, it solves the solver and prints the solution if one exists."
