You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Margaret, Donna and Helen for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMargaret has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nDonna has blocked their calendar on Monday during 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nHelen has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nHelen do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It uses the Z3 solver to find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. The function returns a string representing the solution in the required format. If no solution is found, it returns a message indicating that.\n\nThe example usage at the end shows how to use the function with the given schedules and constraints. The schedules are represented as lists of start times in minutes, and the day is set to 'Monday'. The function is then called with these inputs, and the result is printed to the console."
