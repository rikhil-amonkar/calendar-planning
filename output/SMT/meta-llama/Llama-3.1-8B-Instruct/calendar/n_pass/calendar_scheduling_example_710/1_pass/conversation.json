You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Cheryl and Kyle for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nCheryl is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 15:00 to 15:30; \nKyle is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nCheryl can not meet on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the days of the week, start and end times, and meeting duration. Then it defines the variables and constraints, including the busy times for Cheryl and Kyle. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the solution if one is found."
