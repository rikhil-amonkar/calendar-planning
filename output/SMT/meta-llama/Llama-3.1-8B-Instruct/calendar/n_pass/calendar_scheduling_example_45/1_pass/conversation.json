You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Andrew, Grace and Samuel for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAndrew's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nGracehas no meetings the whole day.\nSamuel has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the day and time slots, the variables for the meeting day and time, and the constraints for each participant. It then combines the constraints and solves them using the Z3 solver. If a solution is found, it prints the result in the required format. If no solution is found, it prints a message indicating that."
