You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Judy and Nicole for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJudy is free the entire day.\nNicole has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 16:30; \n\nNicole would rather not meet on Monday before 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `schedule_meeting` function defines the day to meet, the meeting duration, and the existing schedules for Judy and Nicole. It then defines the variables for the start and end time of the meeting and the constraints for these variables. The program checks if the meeting conflicts with Nicole's existing schedule and solves the constraints using the Z3 solver. Finally, it prints the solution."
