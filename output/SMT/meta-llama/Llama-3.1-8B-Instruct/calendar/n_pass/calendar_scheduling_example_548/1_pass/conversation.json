You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Judy and Nicole for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJudy is free the entire day.\nNicole has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 16:30; \n\nNicole would rather not meet on Monday before 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The solution is then printed out in the required format.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the meeting duration is 30 minutes and that the existing schedules and preferences are defined as shown in the example. You may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case.\n\nAlso, note that the `Monday` to `Sunday` constants are part of the `z3` library and are used to represent the days of the week. The `Int` function is used to create integer variables, and the `domain` method is used to specify the domain of the variable. The `And` function is used to create conjunctions of constraints, and the `Or` function is used to create disjunctions of constraints. The `Solver` class is used to create a solver that can be used to solve the problem, and the `check` method is used to check whether a solution exists. If a solution exists, the `model` method is used to get the solution, and the values of the variables are converted to strings and printed out."
