You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Adam, John, Stephanie and Anna for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAdam has meetings on Monday during 14:00 to 15:00; \nJohn is busy on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nStephanie has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nAnna is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nAnna would rather not meet on Monday before 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The function uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints and preferences.\n\nThe constraints are represented as a dictionary where the keys are the participant names and the values are lists of times that are busy for each participant. The preferences are also represented as a dictionary where the keys are the participant names and the values are the preferred times.\n\nThe function first creates a Z3 solver and defines the variables as boolean arrays representing the availability of each participant at each time slot. It then adds the constraints to the solver, including the constraints for each participant and the preference constraints if any. Finally, it checks if there's a solution and returns the scheduled meeting time if one exists.\n\nIn the example, the participants are 'Adam', 'John', 'Stephanie', and 'Anna', and the constraints and preferences are defined as shown. The day is 'Monday', the start time is '9:00', and the end time is '17:00'. The function is then called to schedule the meeting, and the result is printed to the console."
