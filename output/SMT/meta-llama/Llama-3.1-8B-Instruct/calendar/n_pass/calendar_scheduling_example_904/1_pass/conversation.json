You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Daniel and Bradley for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nDaniel is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 14:00 to 14:30, Thursday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Friday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBradley is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, Tuesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30, Friday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:30; \n\nDaniel would rather not meet on Wednesday. Thursday. Bradley do not want to meet on Monday. Tuesday before 12:00. Friday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the days of the week and the start and end times. It then creates a Z3 solver and declares the variables. It adds constraints for each day, including the day, start time, and end time, as well as the busy times for Daniel and Bradley. Finally, it checks if there is a solution and returns the solution in the required format."
