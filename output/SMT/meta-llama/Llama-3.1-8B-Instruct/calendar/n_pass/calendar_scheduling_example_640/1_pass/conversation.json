You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Bobby and Michael for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBobby is busy on Monday during 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nMichael is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the variables for the meeting day and time, and then adds the constraints for the day, start time, end time, Bobby's schedule, and Michael's schedule. It then solves the solver and prints the solution if one is found. The solution is printed in the format specified in the problem statement.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the schedules are given as lists of tuples, where each tuple represents a busy period and the time is represented as a `Time` object. The `Time` object is assumed to have `hour` and `minute` attributes.\n\nAlso note that this program uses the 24-hour clock for the times, as specified in the problem statement."
