You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Patrick and Roy for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nPatrick's calendar is wide open the entire week.\nRoy is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the days of the week, start and end times, existing schedules for Roy, and the meeting duration. It then defines the solver and variables, adds constraints for the day, start and end times, meeting duration, and Roy's schedule, and checks if there is a solution. If there is a solution, it prints the day, start time, and end time. If there is no solution, it prints a message saying so."
