You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Tyler, Kelly, Stephanie, Hannah, Joe, Diana and Deborah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nTyler is free the entire day.\nKellyhas no meetings the whole day.\nStephanie has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nHannahhas no meetings the whole day.\nJoe has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 17:00; \nDiana has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nDeborah is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `t` variable represents the start time of the meeting, and the constraints ensure that it is within the work hours, on the hour, and does not conflict with any of the participants' schedules. If a solution exists, the code prints the solution in the required format."
