You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Judith and Timothy for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJudith has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, Wednesday during 11:30 to 12:00; \nTimothy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nJudith would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. Wednesday before 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then defines the existing schedules for Judith and Timothy and Judith's preferences. The code then creates a Z3 solver and defines the variables. It adds the constraints to the solver, including the constraints on the day, start and end times, and the constraints on the existing schedules and preferences. Finally, it solves the problem and returns the solution if one exists."
