You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Wayne, Melissa, Catherine, Gregory, Victoria, Thomas and Jennifer for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nWayne is free the entire day.\nMelissa has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nCatherine is free the entire day.\nGregory has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nVictoria is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \nThomas has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:00; \nJennifer has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nWayne would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The program first defines the day of the meeting, the start and end times for the meeting, and the constraints for each participant. It then adds these constraints to the solver and solves the constraints. If a solution is found, the program prints the solution in the required format."
