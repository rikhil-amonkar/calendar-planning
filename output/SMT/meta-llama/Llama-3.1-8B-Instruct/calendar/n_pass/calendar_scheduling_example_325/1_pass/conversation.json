You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jose, Keith, Logan, Megan, Gary and Bobby for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJose has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nKeith has meetings on Monday during 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nLogan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nMegan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 16:30; \nGary has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30; \nBobby is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 16:00; \n\nJose do not want to meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The function uses Z3 to solve the constraints and find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. The `schedules` list contains the schedules for each person, and the `constraints` list contains the given constraints. The `schedule_meeting` function adds constraints for each person's schedule, the meeting duration, the meeting time, and the given constraints, and then solves the constraints using Z3. If a solution is found, the function returns a string representing the solution; otherwise, it returns 'No solution found'."
