You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for John and Jennifer for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJohnhas no meetings the whole week.\nJennifer has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nJohn would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 14:30. Tuesday. Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the days of the week, hours of the day, meeting duration, and constraints for Jennifer's schedule. It then defines the constraints for John's schedule and preferences. The solver is defined, and the variables are created. The constraints are then added to the solver. Finally, the solver is checked, and if a solution is found, it is printed."
