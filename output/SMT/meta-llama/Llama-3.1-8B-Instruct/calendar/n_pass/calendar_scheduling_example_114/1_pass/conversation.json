You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Stephanie, Cheryl, Bradley and Steven for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nStephanie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nCheryl has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBradley has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nSteven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It creates a list of all available time slots and then filters out the time slots that are not available for each person. It then creates a list of time slots that are at least 'duration' minutes apart and adds constraints to the Z3 solver to ensure that the meeting starts and ends at one of these time slots. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the solution if one exists.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the busy times for each person are given as a dictionary where the keys are the hours and the values are dictionaries with the minutes as keys and a boolean indicating whether the person is busy at that time as the value. The duration of the meeting is given as an integer representing the number of minutes."
