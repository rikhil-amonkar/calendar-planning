You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Joan, Megan, Austin, Betty, Judith, Terry and Kathryn for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJoan has meetings on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nMegan has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nAustin is free the entire day.\nBetty has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nJudith has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00; \nTerry is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nKathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It uses the Z3 solver to check if there is a solution that satisfies all the constraints. The constraints include the meeting duration, the meeting time, and the day.\n\nThe schedules are defined as a dictionary where the keys are the names of the people and the values are lists of tuples representing the time ranges when they are busy.\n\nThe function `find_meeting_time` returns a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in the exact format specified in the problem.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the start and end times are real numbers in the range [9, 17]. The `Real` function from the Z3 library is used to declare real variables, and the `as_long` method is used to get the integer value of the real variable.\n\nAlso, note that this code uses the `sat` method of the solver to check if there is a solution that satisfies all the constraints. If there is a solution, the `model` method is used to get the model, and the `as_long` method is used to get the integer value of the real variables representing the start and end times."
