You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Carl and Margaret for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nCarl is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, Tuesday during 14:30 to 15:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, Thursday during 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMargaret is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nCarl would like to avoid more meetings on Thursday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

Note that the `meeting_duration` variable is set to 1 hour, which means the meeting will last for 1 hour. You can adjust this variable to change the meeting duration.\n\nAlso, the `carl_preferences` dictionary is used to store Carl's preferences for Thursday. The keys are the days and the values are lists of time slots that Carl prefers. In this case, Carl prefers to meet on Thursday between 09:00 and 10:00.\n\nThe `s.check()` function is used to solve the constraints. The `s.model()` function is used to get the model of the solution.\n\nFinally, the solution is printed to the console. The day, start time, and end time are printed in the format specified in the problem statement."
