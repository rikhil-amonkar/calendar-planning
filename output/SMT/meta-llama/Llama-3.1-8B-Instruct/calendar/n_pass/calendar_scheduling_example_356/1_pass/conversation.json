You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Katherine, Rebecca, Julie, Angela, Nicholas and Carl for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKatherine is busy on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30; \nRebeccahas no meetings the whole day.\nJulie is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nAngela has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nNicholas has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nCarl has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nAngela would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The schedules are represented as lists of tuples, where each tuple represents a time interval. The preferences are represented as a list of boolean values, where `True` indicates that the participant prefers to have a meeting before 15:00.\n\nThe function uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies the constraints. The constraints include:\n\n* Each participant is busy during their scheduled times.\n* The meeting time must be within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00.\n* The meeting time must be at least 30 minutes long.\n* The meeting time must be after the earliest start time of all participants.\n* The meeting time must be before the latest end time of all participants.\n* If a participant prefers to have a meeting before 15:00, then the meeting time must be before 15:00.\n\nThe function returns a string representing the solution, which includes the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. If no solution is found, the function returns 'No solution found'."
