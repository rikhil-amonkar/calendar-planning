You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Katherine, Rebecca, Julie, Angela, Nicholas and Carl for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKatherine is busy on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30; \nRebeccahas no meetings the whole day.\nJulie is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nAngela has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nNicholas has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nCarl has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nAngela would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The solution is printed in the required format.\n\nNote that the `busy_times` list represents the existing schedules of each participant, where each inner list contains tuples representing the start and end times of each busy period.\n\nAlso note that the `schedule_meeting` function takes the day, start time, end time, and busy times as input, and returns the solution if one exists.\n\nThe code uses Z3's `Bool` and `Implies` functions to create variables and constraints, and the `check` method to check if the solution is satisfiable. If a solution exists, it extracts the start and end times from the model and prints the solution in the required format."
