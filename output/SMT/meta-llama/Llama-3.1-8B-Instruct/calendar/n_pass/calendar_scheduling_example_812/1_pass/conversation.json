You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Mary and Alexis for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMary has meetings on Tuesday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30; \nAlexis has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 10:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The function uses the Z3 solver to find a meeting time that works for both participants.\n\nThe code first defines the days of the week and the start and end times of the work hours. It then creates Z3 variables for the meeting day, start time, and end time, and defines the constraints for these variables.\n\nThe code then defines the constraints for Mary's and Alexis's schedules by iterating over their existing schedules and adding constraints to ensure that the meeting time does not conflict with their existing appointments.\n\nFinally, the code uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints. If a solution is found, it is returned as a string representing the meeting day, start time, and end time. If no solution is found, the code returns a message indicating that no solution was found."
