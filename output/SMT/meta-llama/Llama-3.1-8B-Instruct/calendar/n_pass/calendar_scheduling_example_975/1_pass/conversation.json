You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Nicole and Daniel for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nNicole has meetings on Tuesday during 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 15:00 to 15:30, Friday during 12:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nDaniel is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Friday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the days of the week, start and end times, meeting duration, and existing schedules for Nicole and Daniel. Then, it creates Z3 variables for the meeting day, start time, end time, and meeting duration, and defines the constraints for these variables. The objective function is to meet at the earliest availability. The program then solves the problem using the Z3 solver and prints the solution if one exists."
