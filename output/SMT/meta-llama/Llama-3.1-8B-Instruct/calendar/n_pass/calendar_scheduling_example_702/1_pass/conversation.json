You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Robert and Ralph for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nRobert has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nRalph is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nRobert would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then defines the existing schedules for Robert and Ralph. The preferences for Robert are also defined.\n\nThe code then creates a Z3 solver and defines the variables for the day, start time, and end time. It adds constraints for these variables, including constraints for the existing schedules and the preferences.\n\nFinally, the code checks if there is a solution and prints the solution if one is found."
