You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Juan, Marilyn and Ronald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJuan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nMarilyn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nRonald has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:30; \n\nJuan can not meet on Monday after 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the day, start and end time of the work hours, and the meeting duration. Then it defines the existing schedules for each participant as lists of tuples representing the start and end times of their busy periods.\n\nIt then creates Z3 variables for the meeting time and defines the constraints using the `Optimize` solver. The constraints ensure that the meeting time does not conflict with any of the participants' busy periods.\n\nFinally, it solves the optimization problem using the `check` method and prints the solution. The solution is printed in the required format, with the day, start time, and end time."
