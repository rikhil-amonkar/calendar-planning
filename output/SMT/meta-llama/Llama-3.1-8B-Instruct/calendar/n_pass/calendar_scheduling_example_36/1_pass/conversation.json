You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ryan, Ruth and Denise for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nRyan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nRuthhas no meetings the whole day.\nDenise has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:30; \n\nDenise do not want to meet on Monday after 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `timedelta` function is used to convert the minutes to a string in the format HH:MM. \n\nAlso note that this program uses the `z3` library, which can be installed using pip: `pip install z3-solver`."
