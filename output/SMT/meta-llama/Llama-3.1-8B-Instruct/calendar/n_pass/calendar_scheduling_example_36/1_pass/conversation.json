You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ryan, Ruth and Denise for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nRyan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nRuthhas no meetings the whole day.\nDenise has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:30; \n\nDenise do not want to meet on Monday after 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nThe function first creates Z3 variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. It then defines the constraints, including the availability of each participant, the maximum duration of the meeting, and any additional preferences.\n\nThe function then defines the objective function, which is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nThe function solves the problem using the Z3 solver and checks if a solution exists. If a solution exists, it extracts the solution and returns it in the required format. If no solution exists, it returns a message indicating that no solution exists.\n\nIn the example usage, the function is called with the availability of each participant, the maximum duration of the meeting, and any additional preferences. The function returns a string that represents the solution, which is the day, start time, and end time of the meeting."
