You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jean and Doris for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJean is busy on Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDoris has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nDoris would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It uses the Z3 solver to find a time that works for both of their schedules and constraints. The function returns a string that represents the solution, which includes the day, start time, and end time of the meeting.\n\nIn the example usage, we define the schedules of Jean and Doris, as well as Doris's preference. We then call the `schedule_meeting` function with these inputs and print the solution."
