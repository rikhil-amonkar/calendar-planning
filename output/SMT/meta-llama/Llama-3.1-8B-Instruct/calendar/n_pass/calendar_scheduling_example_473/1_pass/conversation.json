You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Gregory, Jonathan, Barbara, Jesse, Alan, Nicole and Catherine for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nGregory has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00; \nJonathan has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBarbara has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:00; \nJesse is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 14:30; \nAlan is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nNicole has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 17:00; \nCatherine is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the day of the meeting and the start and end times of the meeting. It then defines the participants and their schedules. The program creates a Z3 solver and defines the variables for the start time of the meeting. It then defines the constraints for each participant, ensuring that the meeting time does not conflict with their scheduled times. Finally, it checks if a solution exists and prints the solution if one is found."
