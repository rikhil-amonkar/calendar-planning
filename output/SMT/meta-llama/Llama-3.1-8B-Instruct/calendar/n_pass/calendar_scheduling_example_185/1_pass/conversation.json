You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kimberly, Megan, Marie and Diana for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMeganhas no meetings the whole day.\nMarie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDiana is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nMegan would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 10:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints. The function returns a string describing the scheduled meeting time.\n\nThe constraints are defined as a dictionary where the keys are the participant names and the values are lists of time intervals they are busy. The meeting duration is also a parameter of the function.\n\nThe code uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints. The constraints include:\n\n* The meeting should not start before 10:00 for Megan.\n* The meeting should not conflict with existing meetings.\n* The meeting should satisfy the constraints for each participant.\n\nIf a solution is found, the function returns a string describing the scheduled meeting time. Otherwise, it returns 'No solution found'.\n\nThe example usage at the end of the code demonstrates how to use the `schedule_meeting` function to schedule a meeting for the given participants on Monday."
