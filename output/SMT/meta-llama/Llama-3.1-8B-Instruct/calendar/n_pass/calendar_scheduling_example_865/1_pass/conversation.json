You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Megan and Daniel for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMegan has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Thursday during 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nDaniel is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the days of the week, start and end times, and the meeting duration. It then creates Z3 variables for the meeting day, start time, and end time, and defines the constraints based on the existing schedules and the meeting duration. Finally, it checks if there's a solution and prints it if found."
