You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Lisa and Anthony for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nLisa is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 14:00 to 16:00; \nAnthony is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nYou would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It uses the Z3 solver to find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. The solution is then printed in the required format. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use this function with the given schedules and meeting duration."
