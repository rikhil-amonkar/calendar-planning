You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Betty and Megan for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBetty is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Friday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nMegan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30, Friday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nBetty can not meet on Wednesday. Thursday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the days of the week, hours of the day, and meeting duration. Then it defines the constraints for Betty and Megan, as well as the preferences for the meeting day. It creates a Z3 solver and declares the variables for the day, start time, and end time. It adds the constraints for the day, start and end time, and meeting duration. It also adds the constraints for Betty and Megan. Finally, it checks if there is a solution and prints the solution if it exists."
