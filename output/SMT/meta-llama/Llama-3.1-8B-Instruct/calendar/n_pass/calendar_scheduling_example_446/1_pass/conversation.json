You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Megan, Christine, Gabriel, Sara, Bruce, Kathryn and Billy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMegan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30; \nChristine has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \nGabriel is free the entire day.\nSara has meetings on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nBruce has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \nKathryn is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nBilly has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `schedule_meeting` function takes the existing schedules for everyone during the day and the meeting duration as input, and returns the day, start time, and end time of the meeting.\n\nThe code first defines the variables and constraints, including the meeting day, start time, and end time, as well as the availability of each participant. It then checks if the meeting time conflicts with any participant's schedule and if the meeting time is at least 30 minutes long. Finally, it solves the constraints using the Z3 solver and prints the solution.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the meeting duration is 30 minutes, which is defined as `duration = 0.5` in the code. You can adjust this value as needed."
