You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for James and John for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJames has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nJohn is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then checks the solution and prints the meeting time if a solution is found. \n\nNote that this code assumes that the meeting duration is 1 hour. If the meeting duration is different, you need to modify the code accordingly. \n\nAlso, note that the code uses the 24-hour format for the time. If you want to use the 12-hour format, you need to modify the code to convert the time to 12-hour format. \n\nFinally, note that the code assumes that the day of the week is represented by an integer from 0 to 6, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. If the day of the week is represented differently, you need to modify the code accordingly. \n\nThis code should work for the given example tasks and solutions. However, it may not work for more complex scheduling problems."
