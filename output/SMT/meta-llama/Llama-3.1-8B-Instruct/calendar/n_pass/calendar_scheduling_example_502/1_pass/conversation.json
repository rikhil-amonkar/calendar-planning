You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jack and Charlotte for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJack is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nCharlotte has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00; \n\nJack would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `schedule_meeting` function takes in the schedules of Jack and Charlotte, the meeting duration, the day of the meeting, and any preferences as input. It defines variables for the start time, converts the schedules and meeting duration to minutes, and defines constraints based on the schedules and preferences. The program then solves the problem using the Z3 solver and returns a string with the solution if one exists. If no solution is found, it returns 'No solution found'."
