You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Cheryl and James for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nCheryl's calendar is wide open the entire week.\nJames has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 16:00, Thursday during 9:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nCheryl would rather not meet on Wednesday. Thursday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The program first defines the days of the week, start and end times of the work hours, and the meeting duration. It then defines the existing schedules for James and the preferences for Cheryl. The program creates a Z3 solver and defines the variables for the day, start time, and end time. It adds constraints for each day, including the meeting duration, work hours, and non-conflicting times with James' schedule. Finally, it adds constraints for Cheryl's preferences and solves the constraints. The program prints the solution, including the day, start time, and end time."
