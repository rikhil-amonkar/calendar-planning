You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jeffrey and Harold for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJeffrey is free the entire week.\nHarold has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nHarold would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. Tuesday before 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the variables `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time`, and adds constraints to the solver based on the given information. The script then solves the problem and prints the solution if one exists.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that the start time and end time are in 24-hour format, and that the meeting duration is 30 minutes. If the meeting duration is different, you will need to adjust the script accordingly.\n\nAlso note that this script uses the `Or` function to specify multiple possible values for the `start_time` variable. This is because the start time can be any of the specified values, and the solver will try to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nFinally, note that this script uses the `as_long()` function to get the value of the `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time` variables as integers. This is because the `model` object returns the values as `z3.z3.Lit` objects, which need to be converted to integers before they can be printed."
