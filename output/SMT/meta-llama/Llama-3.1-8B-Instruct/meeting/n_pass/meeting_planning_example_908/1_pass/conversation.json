problem, including the location and time for each meeting. The solution is obtained by using the Z3 solver to find a model that satisfies all the constraints. The constraints include the time slots for each friend, the requirement to meet each friend for at least the required time, and the requirement to arrive at Financial District at 9:00AM."
