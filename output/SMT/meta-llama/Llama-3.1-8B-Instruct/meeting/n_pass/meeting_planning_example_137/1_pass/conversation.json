Kenneth will be at Chinatown from 12:00PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 90 minutes. Barbara will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:15AM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The program defines the variables for start time, end time, Kenneth meeting time, and Barbara meeting time, and then defines the constraints for each variable. The objective function is to maximize the total meeting time with Kenneth and Barbara. The program then solves the optimization problem and prints the solution if one is found."
