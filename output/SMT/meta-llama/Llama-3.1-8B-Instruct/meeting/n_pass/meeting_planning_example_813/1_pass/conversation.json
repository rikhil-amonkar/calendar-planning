It uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints. The constraints include meeting Joshua for at least 105 minutes, meeting Jeffrey for at least 75 minutes, meeting Charles for at least 120 minutes, meeting Joseph for at least 60 minutes, meeting Elizabeth for at least 45 minutes, meeting Matthew for at least 45 minutes, meeting Carol for at least 15 minutes, meeting Paul for at least 15 minutes, and meeting Rebecca for at least 45 minutes.\n\nThe code defines the variables, constraints, and solves the problem using the Z3 solver. If a solution exists, it prints the solution; otherwise, it prints a message indicating that no solution exists."
