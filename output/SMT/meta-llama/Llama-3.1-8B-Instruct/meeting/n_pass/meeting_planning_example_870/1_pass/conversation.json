It uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies the constraints.\n\nThe constraints include:\n\n*   The start time is 9:00 AM and the end time is 24:00 PM.\n*   Each person has a specific meeting time range.\n*   The meeting locations are defined by the `meeting_locations` list.\n*   The travel times between locations are defined by the `travel_times_between_locations` list.\n*   The constraints for meeting people are defined by the `people_meeting` list.\n\nThe code then solves the problem using the Z3 solver and prints the solution if one exists.\n\nNote that this is a complex problem and the solution may not always be optimal. The Z3 solver may take a long time to find a solution or may not be able to find one at all."
