Charles will be at Alamo Square from 6:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 90 minutes. Margaret will be at Russian Hill from 9:00AM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 30 minutes. Daniel will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:00AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 15 minutes. Stephanie will be at Mission District from 8:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The solver takes into account the travel distances, the constraints on the meeting times, and the schedule constraints. The solution is printed to the console.\n\nPlease note that this is a complex problem, and the solution may not be unique. The Z3 solver will find one of the possible solutions.\n\nAlso, please note that this code assumes that the travel times are in minutes, and the meeting times are in minutes. You may need to adjust the code if the travel times and meeting times are in a different unit."
