Jessica will be at Golden Gate Park from 1:45PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 30 minutes. Ashley will be at Bayview from 5:15PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 105 minutes. Ronald will be at Chinatown from 7:15AM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 90 minutes. William will be at North Beach from 1:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 15 minutes. Daniel will be at Mission District from 7:00AM to 11:15AM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It uses the Z3 solver to find the optimal solution. The code first defines the travel times between locations, the start and end times for each friend, and the minimum meeting times. It then defines the variables and constraints for the problem, including the objective function to maximize the number of friends met. The code finally solves the problem and prints the solution.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the travel times are in minutes and the times for each friend are in hours. It also assumes that the minimum meeting times are in hours. You may need to adjust the code to fit your specific problem."
