Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nPacific Heights to Presidio: 11.\nPacific Heights to Marina District: 6.\nPresidio to Pacific Heights: 11.\nPresidio to Marina District: 10.\nMarina District to Pacific Heights: 7.\nMarina District to Presidio: 10.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Pacific Heights at 9:00AM. Jason will be at Presidio from 10:00AM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 90 minutes. Kenneth will be at Marina District from 3:30PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The objective function is defined as the disjunction of all the locations at each time point, which means that the solver will try to find a schedule where you visit as many locations as possible. The `minimize` method is used to minimize the objective function, which is equivalent to maximizing the time spent at each location.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the travel times are given in minutes and that the availability of each friend is given in minutes since the start of the day. The code also assumes that the minimum meeting time for each friend is given in minutes.\n\nAlso note that this code uses a simple greedy algorithm to find a schedule that meets all the constraints and maximizes the time spent at each location. This algorithm may not always find the optimal solution, especially if there are many constraints and locations. In such cases, a more advanced algorithm such as a genetic algorithm or a simulated annealing algorithm may be needed to find the optimal solution."
