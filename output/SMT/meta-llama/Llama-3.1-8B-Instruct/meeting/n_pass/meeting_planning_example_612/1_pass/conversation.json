The solution is then printed out, showing the location and time for each meeting. The travel times are also taken into account when calculating the time for each meeting.\n\nAlso note that the code assumes that the travel times are symmetric, i.e., the travel time from location A to location B is the same as the travel time from location B to location A. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code to handle the asymmetric travel times.\n\nThe code also assumes that the start time is 9:00 AM and the end time is 24 hours later. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code to handle the different start and end times.\n\nFinally, the code uses the `sat` method of the solver to check if a solution exists. If a solution exists, the `model` attribute of the solver is used to get the values of the variables. If no solution exists, the code prints out a message indicating that no solution exists."
