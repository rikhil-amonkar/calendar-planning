It first defines the variables and constraints, then adds the constraints to the solver. The constraints ensure that the time at each location is consistent with the travel times and the meeting times. The solver is then used to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints. If a solution is found, it is printed out. Otherwise, a message is printed indicating that no solution was found.\n\nNote: This program may take some time to run due to the complexity of the problem."
