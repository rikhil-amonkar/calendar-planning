Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nEmbarcadero to Golden Gate Park: 25.\nEmbarcadero to Haight-Ashbury: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Bayview: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Presidio: 20.\nEmbarcadero to Financial District: 5.\nGolden Gate Park to Embarcadero: 25.\nGolden Gate Park to Haight-Ashbury: 7.\nGolden Gate Park to Bayview: 23.\nGolden Gate Park to Presidio: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nHaight-Ashbury to Embarcadero: 20.\nHaight-Ashbury to Golden Gate Park: 7.\nHaight-Ashbury to Bayview: 18.\nHaight-Ashbury to Presidio: 15.\nHaight-Ashbury to Financial District: 21.\nBayview to Embarcadero: 19.\nBayview to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nBayview to Haight-Ashbury: 19.\nBayview to Presidio: 31.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nPresidio to Embarcadero: 20.\nPresidio to Golden Gate Park: 12.\nPresidio to Haight-Ashbury: 15.\nPresidio to Bayview: 31.\nPresidio to Financial District: 23.\nFinancial District to Embarcadero: 4.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nFinancial District to Haight-Ashbury: 19.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Presidio: 22.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Embarcadero at 9:00AM. Mary will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:45AM to 11:45AM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 45 minutes. Kevin will be at Haight-Ashbury from 10:15AM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 90 minutes. Deborah will be at Bayview from 3:00PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 120 minutes. Stephanie will be at Presidio from 10:00AM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 120 minutes. Emily will be at Financial District from 11:30AM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the time slots for each person and the meeting requirements. Then it defines the locations and their distances. The variables for the schedule are defined as Boolean variables for whether to meet each person and integer variables for the time spent with each person. The constraints for the schedule are added, including the requirement to meet Mary, the meeting requirements for the other people, and the travel times between locations. Finally, the problem is solved and the solution is printed out."
