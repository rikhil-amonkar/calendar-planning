It defines the variables, constraints, and objective function, and then solves the optimization problem. The optimal meeting start and end times are printed, along with the optimal travel time. The optimal schedule is also printed.\n\nNote that the optimal schedule may involve traveling from Russian Hill to Pacific Heights and back, depending on the constraints and the optimal solution found by the Z3 solver."
