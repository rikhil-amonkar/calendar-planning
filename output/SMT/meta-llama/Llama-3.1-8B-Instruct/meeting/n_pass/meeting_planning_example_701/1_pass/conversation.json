The problem is solved using the Z3 solver. The code defines the variables, constraints, and travel times, and then adds the constraints to the solver. Finally, it checks the solution and prints the result.\n\nNote that this is a complex problem and the solution may not be optimal. The code assumes that the travel times are given and that the friends' availability times are fixed. In a real-world scenario, the travel times and friends' availability times may be uncertain or subject to change."
