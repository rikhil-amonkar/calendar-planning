It defines the travel distances between locations, the start and end times for each friend, and the minimum meeting times required. It then defines the location variables and the constraints for each friend, including the meeting times and locations. The code then solves the problem and prints the locations and meeting times if a solution is found.\n\nPlease note that this code may take some time to run due to the complexity of the problem. Also, the solution found by the code may not be optimal, as the Z3 solver uses a heuristic approach to find a solution."
