Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nThe Castro to Mission District: 7.\nThe Castro to Financial District: 20.\nMission District to The Castro: 7.\nMission District to Financial District: 17.\nFinancial District to The Castro: 23.\nFinancial District to Mission District: 17.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at The Castro at 9:00AM. Laura will be at Mission District from 12:15PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 75 minutes. Anthony will be at Financial District from 12:30PM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
