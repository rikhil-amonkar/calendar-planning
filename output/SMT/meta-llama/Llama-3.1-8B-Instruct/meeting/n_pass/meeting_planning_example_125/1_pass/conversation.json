Stephanie will be at Financial District from 8:15AM to 11:30AM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 90 minutes. John will be at Alamo Square from 10:15AM to 8:45PM.

The objective function is to minimize the total travel distance. The constraints ensure that we meet Stephanie for at least 90 minutes and John for at least 30 minutes, and that we arrive at each location before the other person leaves.\n\nNote that the travel distances are assumed to be in minutes, and the start time is assumed to be 9:00 AM. The end time is assumed to be at least 13 hours after the start time.\n\nAlso note that the Z3 solver may not always find the optimal solution, especially for large instances of the problem. In such cases, you may need to use a more powerful solver or a different optimization algorithm."
