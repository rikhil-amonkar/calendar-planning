Jason will be at Richmond District from 1:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 90 minutes. Melissa will be at North Beach from 6:45PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 45 minutes. Brian will be at Financial District from 9:45AM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 15 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:45AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 105 minutes. Laura will be at Union Square from 2:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `travel_distances` dictionary stores the travel times between each pair of locations. The `friends` dictionary stores the availability of each friend, including their start and end times, and the minimum duration of the meeting. The code defines the variables `x` and `t` to represent whether each location is visited and the time spent at each location, respectively. The solver adds constraints to ensure that the time spent at each location is non-negative, does not exceed 24 hours, and is at least 60 minutes if the location is visited. The code also adds constraints to ensure that each friend is visited for at least the minimum duration, and that the travel times are taken into account. Finally, the code solves the problem and prints the schedule if a solution is found."
