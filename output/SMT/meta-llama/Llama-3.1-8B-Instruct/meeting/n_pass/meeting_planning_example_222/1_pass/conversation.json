Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNob Hill to North Beach: 8.\nNob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf: 11.\nNob Hill to Bayview: 19.\nNorth Beach to Nob Hill: 7.\nNorth Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: 5.\nNorth Beach to Bayview: 22.\nFisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill: 11.\nFisherman's Wharf to North Beach: 6.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nBayview to Nob Hill: 20.\nBayview to North Beach: 21.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00AM. Helen will be at North Beach from 7:00AM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Kimberly will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:30PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 45 minutes. Patricia will be at Bayview from 6:00PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
