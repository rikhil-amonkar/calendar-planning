Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNob Hill to North Beach: 8.\nNob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf: 11.\nNob Hill to Bayview: 19.\nNorth Beach to Nob Hill: 7.\nNorth Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: 5.\nNorth Beach to Bayview: 22.\nFisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill: 11.\nFisherman's Wharf to North Beach: 6.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nBayview to Nob Hill: 20.\nBayview to North Beach: 21.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00AM. Helen will be at North Beach from 7:00AM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Kimberly will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:30PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 45 minutes. Patricia will be at Bayview from 6:00PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the travel times between locations, the constraints for meeting each person, and the total time. It then uses the Z3 solver to find the optimal schedule that minimizes the total time. The program prints the optimal schedule and the total time.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the travel times are in minutes and the times for meeting each person are in hours. It also assumes that the start time is 9:00 AM and the maximum time is 24 hours."
