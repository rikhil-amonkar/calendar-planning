Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nRussian Hill to Nob Hill: 5.\nRussian Hill to Mission District: 16.\nRussian Hill to Embarcadero: 8.\nNob Hill to Russian Hill: 5.\nNob Hill to Mission District: 13.\nNob Hill to Embarcadero: 9.\nMission District to Russian Hill: 15.\nMission District to Nob Hill: 12.\nMission District to Embarcadero: 19.\nEmbarcadero to Russian Hill: 8.\nEmbarcadero to Nob Hill: 10.\nEmbarcadero to Mission District: 20.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Russian Hill at 9:00AM. Patricia will be at Nob Hill from 6:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 90 minutes. Ashley will be at Mission District from 8:30PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 45 minutes. Timothy will be at Embarcadero from 9:45AM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Timothy for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
