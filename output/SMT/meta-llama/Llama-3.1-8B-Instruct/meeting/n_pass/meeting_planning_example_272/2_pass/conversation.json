Patricia will be at Nob Hill from 6:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 90 minutes. Ashley will be at Mission District from 8:30PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 45 minutes. Timothy will be at Embarcadero from 9:45AM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Timothy for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
