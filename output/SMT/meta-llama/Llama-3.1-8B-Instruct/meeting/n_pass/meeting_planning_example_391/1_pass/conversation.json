Kevin will be at Alamo Square from 8:15AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 75 minutes. Kimberly will be at Russian Hill from 8:45AM to 12:30PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 30 minutes. Joseph will be at Presidio from 6:30PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 45 minutes. Thomas will be at Financial District from 7:00PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Thomas for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The program uses the Z3 solver to find the optimal schedule that minimizes the total time spent traveling and meeting the friends. The program first defines the variables and constraints for each friend, then adds the constraints for the meeting times and the total time. Finally, the program solves the problem and prints the optimal schedule."
