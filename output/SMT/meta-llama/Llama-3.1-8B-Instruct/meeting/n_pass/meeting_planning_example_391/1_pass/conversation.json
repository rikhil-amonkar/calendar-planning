Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nSunset District to Alamo Square: 17.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to Presidio: 16.\nSunset District to Financial District: 30.\nAlamo Square to Sunset District: 16.\nAlamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nAlamo Square to Presidio: 18.\nAlamo Square to Financial District: 17.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\nRussian Hill to Presidio: 14.\nRussian Hill to Financial District: 11.\nPresidio to Sunset District: 15.\nPresidio to Alamo Square: 18.\nPresidio to Russian Hill: 14.\nPresidio to Financial District: 23.\nFinancial District to Sunset District: 31.\nFinancial District to Alamo Square: 17.\nFinancial District to Russian Hill: 10.\nFinancial District to Presidio: 22.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM. Kevin will be at Alamo Square from 8:15AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 75 minutes. Kimberly will be at Russian Hill from 8:45AM to 12:30PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 30 minutes. Joseph will be at Presidio from 6:30PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 45 minutes. Thomas will be at Financial District from 7:00PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Thomas for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The goal is to minimize the total time spent. The code uses the Z3 solver to find the optimal solution.\n\nPlease note that this is a complex problem and the solution may not be unique. The Z3 solver may find multiple solutions or no solution at all.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that the travel times are given as a dictionary where the keys are tuples of two locations and the values are the travel times between these locations.\n\nYou can adjust the constraints and the objective function to fit your specific problem."
