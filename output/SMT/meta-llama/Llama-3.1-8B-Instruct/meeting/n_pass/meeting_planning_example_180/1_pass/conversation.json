Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNorth Beach to Mission District: 18.\nNorth Beach to The Castro: 22.\nMission District to North Beach: 17.\nMission District to The Castro: 7.\nThe Castro to North Beach: 20.\nThe Castro to Mission District: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at North Beach at 9:00AM. James will be at Mission District from 12:45PM to 2:00PM. You'd like to meet James for a minimum of 75 minutes. Robert will be at The Castro from 12:45PM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The solution is then printed out.\n\nNote: The `sat` constant is used to check if the problem has a solution. If the problem is satisfiable, the `model` variable is used to get the values of the variables. The `as_long()` method is used to convert the values to integers.\n\nAlso note that the `minimize` method is used to minimize the total time spent. The `check` method is used to check if the problem has a solution, and the `model` variable is used to get the values of the variables if a solution is found."
