Karen will be at Pacific Heights from 6:45PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 90 minutes. Mark will be at Embarcadero from 1:00PM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The `Optimize` function is used to define the objective function, which is the total time spent. The `minimize` function is used to minimize this objective function. The `check` function is used to check if a solution exists, and the `model` function is used to get the solution if one exists. The solution is then printed out."
