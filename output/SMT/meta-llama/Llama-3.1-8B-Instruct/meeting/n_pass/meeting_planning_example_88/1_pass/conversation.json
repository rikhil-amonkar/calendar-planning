Joshua will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The program defines the variables, constraints, and objective function, and then solves the optimization problem using the Z3 solver.\n\nTo find the optimal schedule, we need to minimize the duration of the trip, which is equivalent to minimizing the end time minus start time. The program uses the `Optimize` class from the Z3 library to define the optimization problem and the `minimize` method to specify the objective function.\n\nThe program then checks the result of the optimization problem and prints the start and end times if a solution is found.\n\nThe output of the program will be the optimal start and end times in minutes, which can be used to plan the trip and meet Joshua at Golden Gate Park."
