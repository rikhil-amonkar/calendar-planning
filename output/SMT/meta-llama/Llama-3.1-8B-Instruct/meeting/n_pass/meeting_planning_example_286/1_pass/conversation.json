Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nUnion Square to Mission District: 14.\nUnion Square to Bayview: 15.\nUnion Square to Sunset District: 26.\nMission District to Union Square: 15.\nMission District to Bayview: 15.\nMission District to Sunset District: 24.\nBayview to Union Square: 17.\nBayview to Mission District: 13.\nBayview to Sunset District: 23.\nSunset District to Union Square: 30.\nSunset District to Mission District: 24.\nSunset District to Bayview: 22.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Union Square at 9:00AM. Rebecca will be at Mission District from 11:30AM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 120 minutes. Karen will be at Bayview from 12:45PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Carol will be at Sunset District from 10:15AM to 11:45AM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The schedule is represented by a set of boolean variables, where each variable corresponds to a friend and a location. The constraints are defined using the `If` function, which checks whether a friend is at a location and whether the time is within the allowed range. The objective function is defined as the sum of the time spent with each friend, minus the start time of each meeting. The program solves the optimization problem and prints the optimal schedule."
