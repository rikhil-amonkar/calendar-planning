It first defines the variables and constraints for each person, then defines the variables and constraints for each location. Finally, it defines the objective function and solves the optimization problem. The solution is then printed out.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the travel times are symmetric, i.e., the time it takes to travel from location A to location B is the same as the time it takes to travel from location B to location A. If this is not the case, the code needs to be modified accordingly.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that the time it takes to meet each person is fixed, i.e., it takes 120 minutes to meet Thomas, 30 minutes to meet Stephanie, etc. If this is not the case, the code needs to be modified accordingly.\n\nFinally, this code assumes that the time it takes to travel between each location is fixed, i.e., it takes 26 minutes to travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview, 25 minutes to travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park, etc. If this is not the case, the code needs to be modified accordingly."
