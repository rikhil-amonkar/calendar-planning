The `x` variables represent the time at which each friend is visited, the `y` variables represent the time at which each friend is met, and the `z` variables represent the duration of each meeting. The objective function is to minimize the total time spent visiting each friend. The constraints are defined based on the given problem statement. The solution is printed out at the end."
