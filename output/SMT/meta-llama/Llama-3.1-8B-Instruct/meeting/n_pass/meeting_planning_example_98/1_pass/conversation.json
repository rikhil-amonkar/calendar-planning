Timothy will be at Richmond District from 8:45PM to 9:30PM.

The `s.maximize` function is used to maximize the meeting time, which is the objective function. The `s.check` function is used to check if a solution exists, and if it does, the `s.model` function is used to get the solution. The solution is then printed out.\n\nNote that the travel times are assumed to be from Alamo Square to Richmond District and back, which is why we add 12 minutes to the end time and 13 minutes to the meeting time to account for the travel time."
