The `travel_times` dictionary stores the travel times between each location, and the `people` dictionary stores the availability of each person. The `min_meeting_times` dictionary stores the minimum meeting times required for each person. The code defines the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` to represent whether to meet each person, the time to meet each person, and the travel time to meet each person, respectively. The code then defines the constraints and the objective function, and solves the optimization problem using the Z3 solver. The solution is printed to the console, along with the total score."
