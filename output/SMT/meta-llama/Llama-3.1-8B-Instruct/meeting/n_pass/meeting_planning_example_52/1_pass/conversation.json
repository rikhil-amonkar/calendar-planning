Barbara will be at Richmond District from 1:15PM to 6:15PM.

It defines the variables, constraints, and objective function, and then solves the problem using the Z3 solver. The optimal schedule is then printed out.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the meeting duration is the only constraint that affects the number of friends met. If there are other constraints, they should be added to the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, note that this code is a simplified version of the problem and does not take into account the travel distances between locations. If the travel distances are significant, they should be taken into account when defining the constraints and objective function."
