You plan to stay in Bucharest for 3 days. You want to spend 5 days in Venice. You are going to attend a wedding in Venice between day 22 and day 26. You want to spend 4 days in Prague. You want to spend 5 days in Frankfurt. From day 12 to day 16, there is a annual show you want to attend in Frankfurt. You want to spend 5 days in Zurich. You would like to visit Florence for 5 days. You want to spend 5 days in Tallinn. You would like to meet your friends at Tallinn between day 8 and day 12 to tour together.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPrague and Tallinn, Prague and Zurich, Florence and Prague, Frankfurt and Bucharest, Frankfurt and Venice, Prague and Bucharest, Bucharest and Zurich, Tallinn and Frankfurt, from Zurich to Florence, Frankfurt and Zurich, Zurich and Venice, Florence and Frankfurt, Prague and Frankfurt, Tallinn and Zurich.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 26 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the cities and their connections, then defines the days and the constraints. It then defines the solver and the variables, adds the constraints, and solves the problem. If a solution is found, it prints the itinerary; otherwise, it prints \"No solution found\".\n\nPlease note that this code may take some time to run due to the complexity of the problem. Also, the solution may not be optimal, as the Z3 solver may not always find the best solution.\n\nAlso, please note that this code assumes that the input data is correct and does not contain any errors. In a real-world application, you would need to add error checking and handling code to deal with potential issues."
