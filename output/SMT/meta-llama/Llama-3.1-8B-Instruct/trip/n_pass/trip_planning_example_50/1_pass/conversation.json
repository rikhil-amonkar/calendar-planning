You want to spend 4 days in Vilnius. You plan to stay in Munich for 3 days. You would like to visit Mykonos for 7 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMunich and Mykonos, from Vilnius to Munich.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the cities, flight durations, total number of days, and minimum stay in each city. It then defines the variables and constraints using Z3's API. Finally, it finds a solution and prints the itinerary in JSON format."
