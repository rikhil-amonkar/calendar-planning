You would like to visit Istanbul for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Vienna. You plan to stay in Riga for 2 days. You plan to stay in Brussels for 2 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Brussels between day 26 and day 27. You plan to stay in Madrid for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Vilnius. You would like to meet your friends at Vilnius between day 20 and day 23 to tour together. You want to spend 5 days in Venice. You have to attend a workshop in Venice between day 7 and day 11. You plan to stay in Geneva for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Geneva between day 1 and day 4. You plan to stay in Munich for 5 days. You would like to visit Reykjavik for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMunich and Vienna, Istanbul and Brussels, Vienna and Vilnius, Madrid and Munich, Venice and Brussels, Riga and Brussels, Geneva and Istanbul, Munich and Reykjavik, Vienna and Istanbul, Riga and Istanbul, Reykjavik and Vienna, Venice and Munich, Madrid and Venice, Vilnius and Istanbul, Venice and Vienna, Venice and Istanbul, from Reykjavik to Madrid, from Riga to Munich, Munich and Istanbul, Reykjavik and Brussels, Vilnius and Brussels, from Vilnius to Munich, Madrid and Vienna, Vienna and Riga, Geneva and Vienna, Madrid and Brussels, Vienna and Brussels, Geneva and Brussels, Geneva and Madrid, Munich and Brussels, Madrid and Istanbul, Geneva and Munich, from Riga to Vilnius.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 27 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
