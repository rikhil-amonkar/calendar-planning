You want to spend 2 days in Split. You want to spend 2 days in Helsinki. You would like to visit Reykjavik for 3 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Reykjavik between day 10 and day 12. You want to spend 3 days in Vilnius. You plan to visit relatives in Vilnius between day 7 and day 9. You would like to visit Geneva for 6 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nSplit and Helsinki, Geneva and Split, Geneva and Helsinki, Helsinki and Reykjavik, Vilnius and Helsinki, Split and Vilnius.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
