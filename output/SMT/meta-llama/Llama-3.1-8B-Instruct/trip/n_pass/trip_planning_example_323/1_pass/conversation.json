You plan to stay in Split for 5 days. From day 7 to day 11, there is a annual show you want to attend in Split. You would like to visit Oslo for 2 days. You want to spend 7 days in London. You plan to visit relatives in London between day 1 and day 7. You would like to visit Porto for 5 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLondon and Oslo, Split and Oslo, Oslo and Porto, London and Split.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `Bool` function is used to create boolean variables for each city and day, and the `Or` and `And` functions are used to create constraints for the direct flights and total days. The `If` function is used to count the total days for each city. The `Sum` function is used to sum up the total days. The `Solver` class is used to create the solver and the `add` method is used to add the constraints to the solver. The `check` method is used to check if a solution exists, and the `model` attribute is used to get the solution."
