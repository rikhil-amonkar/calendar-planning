You plan to stay in Stuttgart for 2 days. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 2 days. You would like to visit Geneva for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Geneva between day 1 and day 4. You plan to stay in Valencia for 6 days. You want to spend 7 days in Munich. You would like to meet your friends at Munich between day 4 and day 10 to tour together.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nGeneva and Munich, Munich and Valencia, Bucharest and Valencia, Munich and Bucharest, Valencia and Stuttgart, Geneva and Valencia.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 17 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The program first defines the variables and creates the solver. It then adds constraints for the total number of days in each city, the day of arrival in each city, and the day of arrival in each city based on the direct flights. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the trip plan if a solution is found."
