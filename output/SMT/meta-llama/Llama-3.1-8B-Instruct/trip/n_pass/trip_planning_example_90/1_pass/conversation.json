You plan to stay in Vilnius for 7 days. You want to spend 5 days in Naples. You plan to visit relatives in Naples between day 1 and day 5. You plan to stay in Vienna for 7 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nNaples and Vienna, Vienna and Vilnius.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 17 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
