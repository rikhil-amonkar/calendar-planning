It first defines the variables and constraints, then uses the `Optimize` class to define the optimization problem. The `maximize` method is used to maximize the total number of days spent in each city. The `check` method is used to check if the problem has a solution. If a solution exists, the `model` attribute of the solver is used to get the values of the variables, and the trip plan is printed."
