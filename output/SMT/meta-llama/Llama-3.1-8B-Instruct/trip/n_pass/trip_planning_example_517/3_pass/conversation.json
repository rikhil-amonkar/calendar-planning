You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 5 days. You would like to visit Warsaw for 2 days. You want to spend 7 days in Stuttgart. During day 7 and day 13, you have to attend a conference in Stuttgart. You would like to visit Bucharest for 6 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Bucharest between day 1 and day 6. You want to spend 3 days in Copenhagen.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nWarsaw and Copenhagen, Stuttgart and Copenhagen, Warsaw and Stuttgart, Bucharest and Copenhagen, Bucharest and Warsaw, Copenhagen and Dubrovnik.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 19 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
