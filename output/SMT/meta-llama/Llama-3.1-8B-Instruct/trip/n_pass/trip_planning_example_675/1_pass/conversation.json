You plan to stay in Dubrovnik for 4 days. You would like to visit Split for 3 days. You would like to visit Milan for 3 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Milan between day 11 and day 13. You want to spend 4 days in Porto. You would like to visit Krakow for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Krakow between day 8 and day 9 to tour together. You plan to stay in Munich for 5 days. From day 4 to day 8, there is a annual show you want to attend in Munich.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMunich and Porto, Split and Milan, Milan and Porto, Munich and Krakow, Munich and Milan, Dubrovnik and Munich, Krakow and Split, Krakow and Milan, Munich and Split.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then solves the constraints and prints out the itinerary if a solution is found.

If a flight is taken on a particular day, the itinerary will include both the departure city and the arrival city for that day."
