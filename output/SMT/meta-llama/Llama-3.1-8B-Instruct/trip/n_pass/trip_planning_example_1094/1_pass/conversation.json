You want to spend 4 days in Vienna. You would like to visit Barcelona for 2 days. You plan to stay in Edinburgh for 4 days. You want to meet a friend in Edinburgh between day 12 and day 15. You would like to visit Krakow for 3 days. You plan to stay in Riga for 4 days. You would like to visit Hamburg for 2 days. During day 10 and day 11, you have to attend a conference in Hamburg. You would like to visit Paris for 2 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Paris between day 1 and day 2. You would like to visit Stockholm for 2 days. You plan to visit relatives in Stockholm between day 15 and day 16.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nHamburg and Stockholm, Vienna and Stockholm, Paris and Edinburgh, Riga and Barcelona, Paris and Riga, Krakow and Barcelona, Edinburgh and Stockholm, Paris and Krakow, Krakow and Stockholm, Riga and Edinburgh, Barcelona and Stockholm, Paris and Stockholm, Krakow and Edinburgh, Vienna and Hamburg, Paris and Hamburg, Riga and Stockholm, Hamburg and Barcelona, Vienna and Barcelona, Krakow and Vienna, from Riga to Hamburg, Barcelona and Edinburgh, Paris and Barcelona, Hamburg and Edinburgh, Paris and Vienna, Vienna and Riga.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the cities, days, and variables, and then adds constraints to the solver based on the problem statement. The solver is then used to find a solution, and the itinerary is printed out.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the solver will find a solution, and it does not handle the case where no solution exists. In practice, you may want to add error handling code to handle this case."
