        "content": "Given the following scheduling problem:\nYou plan to visit 7 European cities for 20 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Paris for 5 days. You plan to stay in Florence for 3 days. You would like to visit Vienna for 2 days. You plan to visit relatives in Vienna between day 19 and day 20. You plan to stay in Porto for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Porto between day 1 and day 3. You want to spend 5 days in Munich. You want to spend 5 days in Nice. You want to spend 3 days in Warsaw. You are going to attend a wedding in Warsaw between day 13 and day 15.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nFlorence and Vienna, Paris and Warsaw, Munich and Vienna, Porto and Vienna, Warsaw and Vienna, from Florence to Munich, Munich and Warsaw, Munich and Nice, Paris and Florence, Warsaw and Nice, Porto and Munich, Porto and Nice, Paris and Vienna, Nice and Vienna, Porto and Paris, Paris and Nice, Paris and Munich, Porto and Warsaw.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the cities and days, then defines the direct flights between cities. It then defines the constraints for the problem, including the fact that each city can only be visited once per day, that a city can only be visited on a day if there is a direct flight from the previous city, and the specific requirements for each city. Finally, it solves the constraints and prints the solution.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the direct flights are bidirectional, i.e. that if there is a direct flight from city A to city B, there is also a direct flight from city B to city A. If this is not the case, the code will need to be modified accordingly.\n\nAlso note that this code uses a simple model to represent the solution, where each city is represented by a boolean variable that is True if the city is visited on a particular day and False otherwise. This model is sufficient for this problem, but may not be suitable for more complex problems."
