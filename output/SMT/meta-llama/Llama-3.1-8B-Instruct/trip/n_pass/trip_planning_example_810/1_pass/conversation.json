You plan to stay in Berlin for 3 days. During day 1 and day 3, you have to attend a conference in Berlin. You plan to stay in Nice for 5 days. You would like to visit Athens for 5 days. You would like to visit Stockholm for 5 days. You want to spend 2 days in Barcelona. You have to attend a workshop in Barcelona between day 3 and day 4. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 4 days. You want to spend 2 days in Lyon. You are going to attend a wedding in Lyon between day 4 and day 5.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLyon and Nice, Stockholm and Athens, Nice and Athens, Berlin and Athens, Berlin and Nice, Berlin and Barcelona, Berlin and Vilnius, Barcelona and Nice, Athens and Vilnius, Berlin and Stockholm, Nice and Stockholm, Barcelona and Athens, Barcelona and Stockholm, Barcelona and Lyon.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the cities, days, and direct flights, and then adds the constraints to the solver. The constraints include the fact that the place must be one of the cities, the number of days in the place must be a non-negative integer, and the number of days in the place must be less than or equal to the number of days. The solver is then used to find a solution, and the itinerary is printed to the console.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input data is correct and that the solver will find a solution. In practice, you may need to add additional error checking and handling code to deal with cases where the solver does not find a solution or where the input data is incorrect."
