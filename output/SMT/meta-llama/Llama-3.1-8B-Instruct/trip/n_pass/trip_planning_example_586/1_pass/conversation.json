You want to spend 3 days in Frankfurt. You want to spend 4 days in Naples. You would like to visit Helsinki for 4 days. From day 2 to day 5, there is a annual show you want to attend in Helsinki. You want to spend 3 days in Lyon. You want to spend 2 days in Prague. You have to attend a workshop in Prague between day 1 and day 2.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPrague and Lyon, Prague and Frankfurt, Frankfurt and Lyon, Helsinki and Naples, Helsinki and Frankfurt, Naples and Frankfurt, Prague and Helsinki.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

It then defines the variables and constraints for the Z3 solver. The constraints ensure that each city is visited for its required duration, the workshop and show are attended at the correct times, and the day of arrival is before the day of departure for each flight. The solver is then checked and the solution is printed. Finally, the trip plan is found by iterating over the cities and their durations, and printing the city and day for each entry in the trip plan."
