You want to spend 3 days in Frankfurt. You want to spend 4 days in Naples. You would like to visit Helsinki for 4 days. From day 2 to day 5, there is a annual show you want to attend in Helsinki. You want to spend 3 days in Lyon. You want to spend 2 days in Prague. You have to attend a workshop in Prague between day 1 and day 2.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPrague and Lyon, Prague and Frankfurt, Frankfurt and Lyon, Helsinki and Naples, Helsinki and Frankfurt, Naples and Frankfurt, Prague and Helsinki.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It uses the `Int` and `IntSort` functions to create integer variables for the day and city, and the `And` and `Or` functions to define the constraints. The `flight_constraint` function checks if a flight is possible on a given day, and the `constraints` function checks if a city is visited on a given day. The solver is then used to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints. The solution is then used to create an itinerary in the required format."
