You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Reykjavik between day 3 and day 4. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Stockholm between day 4 and day 5 to tour together. You would like to visit Porto for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Porto between day 13 and day 17. You want to spend 3 days in Nice. You want to spend 4 days in Venice. You plan to stay in Vienna for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Vienna between day 11 and day 13. You would like to visit Split for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Copenhagen.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nCopenhagen and Vienna, Nice and Stockholm, Split and Copenhagen, Nice and Reykjavik, Nice and Porto, Reykjavik and Vienna, Stockholm and Copenhagen, Nice and Venice, Nice and Vienna, Reykjavik and Copenhagen, Nice and Copenhagen, Stockholm and Vienna, Venice and Vienna, Copenhagen and Porto, Reykjavik and Stockholm, Stockholm and Split, Split and Vienna, Copenhagen and Venice, Vienna and Porto.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 17 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the cities, their durations, and the direct flights between them. It then defines the meeting and workshop constraints, and creates the Z3 solver and variables. The constraints are then added to the solver, and the solver is solved. If a solution is found, it is printed in the required format."
