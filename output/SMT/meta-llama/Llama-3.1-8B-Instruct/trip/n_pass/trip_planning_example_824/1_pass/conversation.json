You would like to visit Berlin for 5 days. From day 1 to day 5, there is a annual show you want to attend in Berlin. You would like to visit Split for 3 days. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Bucharest between day 13 and day 15. You plan to stay in Riga for 5 days. You plan to stay in Lisbon for 3 days. You would like to visit Tallinn for 4 days. You plan to stay in Lyon for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Lyon between day 7 and day 11.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLisbon and Bucharest, Berlin and Lisbon, Bucharest and Riga, Berlin and Riga, Split and Lyon, Lisbon and Riga, from Riga to Tallinn, Berlin and Split, Lyon and Lisbon, Berlin and Tallinn, Lyon and Bucharest.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 22 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
