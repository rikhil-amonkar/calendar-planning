You want to spend 2 days in Oslo. From day 16 to day 17, there is a annual show you want to attend in Oslo. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 5 days. You want to meet a friend in Reykjavik between day 9 and day 13. You would like to visit Stockholm for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Munich. You plan to visit relatives in Munich between day 13 and day 16. You plan to stay in Frankfurt for 4 days. You have to attend a workshop in Frankfurt between day 17 and day 20. You would like to visit Barcelona for 3 days. You would like to visit Bucharest for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Split.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nReykjavik and Munich, Munich and Frankfurt, Split and Oslo, Reykjavik and Oslo, Bucharest and Munich, Oslo and Frankfurt, Bucharest and Barcelona, Barcelona and Frankfurt, Reykjavik and Frankfurt, Barcelona and Stockholm, Barcelona and Reykjavik, Stockholm and Reykjavik, Barcelona and Split, Bucharest and Oslo, Bucharest and Frankfurt, Split and Stockholm, Barcelona and Oslo, Stockholm and Munich, Stockholm and Oslo, Split and Frankfurt, Barcelona and Munich, Stockholm and Frankfurt, Munich and Oslo, Split and Munich.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the cities and days, then defines the variables and constraints. The constraints include the fact that each city can be visited at most once, each city must be visited at least once, and the number of days spent in each city. The program also includes constraints for the direct flights between cities. Finally, it checks if the solver has a solution and prints the trip plan if one is found."
