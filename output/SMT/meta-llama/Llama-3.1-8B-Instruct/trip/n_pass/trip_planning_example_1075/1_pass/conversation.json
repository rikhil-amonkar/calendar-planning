You want to spend 4 days in Vienna. You would like to visit Lyon for 3 days. You plan to stay in Edinburgh for 4 days. From day 5 to day 8, there is a annual show you want to attend in Edinburgh. You want to spend 5 days in Reykjavik. You want to spend 5 days in Stuttgart. You would like to visit Manchester for 2 days. You want to spend 5 days in Split. You are going to attend a wedding in Split between day 19 and day 23. You plan to stay in Prague for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nfrom Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Stuttgart and Split, Stuttgart and Vienna, Prague and Manchester, Edinburgh and Prague, from Manchester to Split, Prague and Vienna, Vienna and Manchester, Prague and Split, Vienna and Lyon, Stuttgart and Edinburgh, Split and Lyon, Stuttgart and Manchester, Prague and Lyon, Reykjavik and Vienna, Prague and Reykjavik, Vienna and Split.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the cities, their corresponding durations, and the direct flights. Then it defines the constraints, including the duration of each city, the annual show and wedding constraints, and the flight constraints. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the itinerary if a solution is found.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the input data is correct and does not include any error checking. In a real-world application, you would want to add error checking to handle invalid input."
