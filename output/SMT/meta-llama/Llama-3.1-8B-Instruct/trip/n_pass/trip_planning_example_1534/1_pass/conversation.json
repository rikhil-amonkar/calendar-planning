You plan to stay in Warsaw for 4 days. You plan to stay in Venice for 3 days. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 3 days. You would like to visit Salzburg for 4 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Salzburg between day 22 and day 25. You want to spend 2 days in Amsterdam. You want to spend 5 days in Barcelona. You would like to meet your friends at Barcelona between day 2 and day 6 to tour together. You plan to stay in Paris for 2 days. You have to attend a workshop in Paris between day 1 and day 2. You want to spend 4 days in Hamburg. During day 19 and day 22, you have to attend a conference in Hamburg. You plan to stay in Florence for 5 days. You want to spend 2 days in Tallinn. You want to meet a friend in Tallinn between day 11 and day 12.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nParis and Venice, Barcelona and Amsterdam, Amsterdam and Warsaw, Amsterdam and Vilnius, Barcelona and Warsaw, Warsaw and Venice, Amsterdam and Hamburg, Barcelona and Hamburg, Barcelona and Florence, Barcelona and Venice, Paris and Hamburg, Paris and Vilnius, Paris and Amsterdam, Paris and Florence, Florence and Amsterdam, Vilnius and Warsaw, Barcelona and Tallinn, Paris and Warsaw, Tallinn and Warsaw, from Tallinn to Vilnius, Amsterdam and Tallinn, Paris and Tallinn, Paris and Barcelona, Venice and Hamburg, Warsaw and Hamburg, Hamburg and Salzburg, Amsterdam and Venice.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then solves the constraints using the Z3 solver and prints the resulting itinerary.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input data is correct and does not include any error handling. In a real-world application, you would want to add error handling to handle cases where the input data is invalid.\n\nAlso, this code uses the Z3 solver, which is a powerful constraint solver. However, it can be slow for large inputs. If you need to solve large instances, you may want to consider using a more efficient solver or a different approach."
