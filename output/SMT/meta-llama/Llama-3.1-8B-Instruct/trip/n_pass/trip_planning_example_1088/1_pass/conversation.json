You plan to stay in Oslo for 5 days. You want to spend 5 days in Stuttgart. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 2 days. During day 1 and day 2, you have to attend a conference in Reykjavik. You plan to stay in Split for 3 days. You plan to stay in Geneva for 2 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Porto between day 19 and day 21. You want to spend 5 days in Tallinn. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Stockholm between day 2 and day 4.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nfrom Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Stockholm and Tallinn, Stockholm and Oslo, Stuttgart and Porto, Oslo and Split, Stockholm and Stuttgart, Reykjavik and Oslo, Oslo and Geneva, Stockholm and Split, Reykjavik and Stockholm, Split and Stuttgart, Tallinn and Oslo, Stockholm and Geneva, Oslo and Porto, Geneva and Porto, Geneva and Split.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 21 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
