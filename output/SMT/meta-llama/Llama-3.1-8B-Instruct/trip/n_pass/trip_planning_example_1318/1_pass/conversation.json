You want to spend 2 days in Oslo. You want to meet a friend in Oslo between day 24 and day 25. You plan to stay in Helsinki for 2 days. You plan to stay in Edinburgh for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Riga. You would like to visit Tallinn for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Tallinn between day 4 and day 8. You would like to visit Budapest for 5 days. You would like to visit Vilnius for 5 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 5 days. You want to spend 4 days in Geneva.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPorto and Oslo, Edinburgh and Budapest, Edinburgh and Geneva, from Riga to Tallinn, Edinburgh and Porto, Vilnius and Helsinki, from Tallinn to Vilnius, Riga and Oslo, Geneva and Oslo, Edinburgh and Oslo, Edinburgh and Helsinki, Vilnius and Oslo, Riga and Helsinki, Budapest and Geneva, Helsinki and Budapest, Helsinki and Oslo, Edinburgh and Riga, Tallinn and Helsinki, Geneva and Porto, Budapest and Oslo, Helsinki and Geneva, from Riga to Vilnius, Tallinn and Oslo.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the variables and the constraints, and then solves the problem using the Z3 solver. If a solution is found, it prints the itinerary in the required format. If no solution is found, it prints a message indicating that. \n\nPlease note that the code assumes that the Z3 solver is installed and available. If not, you can install it using pip: `pip install z3-solver`. \n\nAlso note that the code may take some time to run, depending on the complexity of the problem and the power of the machine it is running on."
