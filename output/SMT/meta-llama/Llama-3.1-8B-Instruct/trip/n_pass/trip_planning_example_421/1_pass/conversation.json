You plan to stay in Nice for 5 days. You plan to visit relatives in Nice between day 1 and day 5. You would like to visit Krakow for 6 days. You would like to visit Dublin for 7 days. You plan to stay in Lyon for 4 days. You plan to stay in Frankfurt for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Frankfurt between day 19 and day 20 to tour together.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nNice and Dublin, Dublin and Frankfurt, Dublin and Krakow, Krakow and Frankfurt, Lyon and Frankfurt, Nice and Frankfurt, Lyon and Dublin, Nice and Lyon.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The constraints are defined as a list of Boolean variables, where each variable represents whether a person is in a particular city on a particular day. The program then adds these constraints to the solver and checks if the solver has a solution. If it does, the program prints out the itinerary."
