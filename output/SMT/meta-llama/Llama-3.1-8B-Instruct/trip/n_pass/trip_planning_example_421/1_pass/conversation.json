You plan to stay in Nice for 5 days. You plan to visit relatives in Nice between day 1 and day 5. You would like to visit Krakow for 6 days. You would like to visit Dublin for 7 days. You plan to stay in Lyon for 4 days. You plan to stay in Frankfurt for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Frankfurt between day 19 and day 20 to tour together.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nNice and Dublin, Dublin and Frankfurt, Dublin and Krakow, Krakow and Frankfurt, Lyon and Frankfurt, Nice and Frankfurt, Lyon and Dublin, Nice and Lyon.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
