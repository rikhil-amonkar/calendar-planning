You want to spend 2 days in Hamburg. You would like to visit Zurich for 3 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Zurich between day 1 and day 3. You would like to visit Helsinki for 2 days. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 2 days. You would like to visit Split for 7 days. During day 4 and day 10, you have to attend a conference in Split.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nZurich and Helsinki, Hamburg and Bucharest, Helsinki and Hamburg, Zurich and Hamburg, Zurich and Bucharest, Zurich and Split, Helsinki and Split, Split and Hamburg.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
