You want to spend 7 days in Reykjavik. You plan to stay in Riga for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Riga between day 1 and day 2. You plan to stay in Warsaw for 3 days. You plan to stay in Istanbul for 6 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Istanbul between day 2 and day 7. You want to spend 7 days in Krakow.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nIstanbul and Krakow, Warsaw and Reykjavik, Istanbul and Warsaw, Riga and Istanbul, Krakow and Warsaw, Riga and Warsaw.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 21 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
