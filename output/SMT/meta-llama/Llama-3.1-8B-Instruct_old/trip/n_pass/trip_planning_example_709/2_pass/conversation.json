You want to meet a friend in Porto between day 16 and day 18. You want to spend 3 days in Prague. You want to spend 4 days in Reykjavik.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nHelsinki and Prague, Prague and Valencia, Valencia and Porto, Helsinki and Reykjavik, Dubrovnik and Helsinki, Reykjavik and Prague.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 18 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
