You want to spend 3 days in Brussels. You would like to visit Helsinki for 3 days. You would like to visit Split for 4 days. You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 2 days. You would like to visit Istanbul for 5 days. From day 1 to day 5, there is a annual show you want to attend in Istanbul. You plan to stay in Milan for 4 days. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 5 days. You have to attend a workshop in Vilnius between day 18 and day 22. You would like to visit Frankfurt for 3 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Frankfurt between day 16 and day 18.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMilan and Frankfurt, Split and Frankfurt, Milan and Split, Brussels and Vilnius, Brussels and Helsinki, Istanbul and Brussels, Milan and Vilnius, Brussels and Milan, Istanbul and Helsinki, Helsinki and Vilnius, Helsinki and Dubrovnik, Split and Vilnius, from Dubrovnik to Istanbul, Istanbul and Milan, Helsinki and Frankfurt, Istanbul and Vilnius, Split and Helsinki, Milan and Helsinki, Istanbul and Frankfurt, from Brussels to Frankfurt, Dubrovnik and Frankfurt, Frankfurt and Vilnius.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 22 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then solves the constraints and prints the days each city is visited. The specific constraints are defined using the `Implies` function, which states that if one city is visited, then another city must also be visited. The `Bool` function is used to create boolean variables for each city and day. The `as_bool()` function is used to get the boolean value of a Z3 value."
