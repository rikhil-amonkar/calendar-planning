You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 5 days. You would like to visit Warsaw for 2 days. You want to spend 7 days in Stuttgart. During day 7 and day 13, you have to attend a conference in Stuttgart. You would like to visit Bucharest for 6 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Bucharest between day 1 and day 6. You want to spend 3 days in Copenhagen.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nWarsaw and Copenhagen, Stuttgart and Copenhagen, Warsaw and Stuttgart, Bucharest and Copenhagen, Bucharest and Warsaw, Copenhagen and Dubrovnik.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 19 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the cities and their corresponding durations, as well as the direct flights between cities. It then creates variables for the number of days in each city, the day of arrival in each city, and the day of departure in each city. It adds constraints for the conference and wedding, the direct flights, the city durations, and the total duration. Finally, it solves the solver and prints the trip plan if a solution is found."
