You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Eric and Henry for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nEric has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00; \nHenry has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nHenry would rather not meet on Monday after 10:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines variables for the day, start time, and end time, and adds constraints for these variables based on the given information. The `schedule_meeting` function takes in the schedules for Eric and Henry, the meeting duration, and any preferences, and prints out a solution if one exists.\n\nNote that the `meeting_duration` variable is set to 0.5, which represents a half-hour meeting. The `preferences` variable is a list of tuples representing the times that Henry would rather not meet. In this case, we've added a preference to not meet after 10:00."
