You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Nancy and Jose for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nNancy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 16:00; \nJose is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `schedule_meeting` function takes in the schedules of Nancy and Jose, as well as the meeting duration, and returns a string representing the solution. If no solution exists, it returns \"No solution exists\".\n\nThe program first creates Z3 variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. It then creates Z3 constraints for the meeting duration, Nancy's schedule, and Jose's schedule. Finally, it checks if a solution exists using the Z3 solver and returns the solution if it does.\n\nThe program uses the following constraints:\n\n*   The day of the meeting must be one of Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n*   The start time and end time of the meeting must be between 9:00 and 17:00.\n*   Nancy's schedule and Jose's schedule must not conflict with the meeting time.\n*   The meeting duration must be 30 minutes.\n\nThe program prints the solution in the format \"SOLUTION:\\nDay: <day>\\nStart Time: <HH:MM>\\nEnd Time: <HH:MM>\". If no solution exists, it prints \"No solution exists\"."
