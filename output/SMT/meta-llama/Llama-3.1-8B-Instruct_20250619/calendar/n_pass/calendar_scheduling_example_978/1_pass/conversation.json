You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Brian and Julia for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBrian is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, Wednesday during 12:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Friday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nJulia is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 13:00 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 17:00, Friday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \n\nBrian would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then adds constraints to ensure that the meeting time does not conflict with Brian's or Julia's schedules. The constraints also ensure that the meeting time is the earliest available time slot. Finally, it solves the constraints and prints the solution."
