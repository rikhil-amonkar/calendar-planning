You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amy and Pamela for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nAmy is busy on Wednesday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00; \nPamela is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nPamela would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday before 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the days of the week, the start and end times of the work hours, and the meeting duration. Then it defines the constraints for Amy's and Pamela's schedules, as well as Pamela's preferences. It creates a solver and adds the constraints and preferences to it. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the solution if one exists."
