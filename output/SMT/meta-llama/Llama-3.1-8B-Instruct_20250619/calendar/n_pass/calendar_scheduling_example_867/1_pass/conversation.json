You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Betty and Scott for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBetty is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nScott is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nBetty can not meet on Monday. Tuesday. Thursday before 15:00. Scott would like to avoid more meetings on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the days and times, then the existing schedules for Betty and Scott. It then defines the constraints for each participant, including the constraints for the meeting duration, day, and time. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the solution if one is found."
