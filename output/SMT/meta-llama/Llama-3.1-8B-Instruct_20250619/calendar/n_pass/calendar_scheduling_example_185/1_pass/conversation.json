You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kimberly, Megan, Marie and Diana for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMeganhas no meetings the whole day.\nMarie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDiana is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nMegan would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 10:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It uses the Z3 solver to find a meeting time that satisfies all the constraints. The function returns a string representing the solution.\n\nThe schedules and preferences are defined as dictionaries, where the keys are the participant names and the values are lists of tuples representing the start and end times of their meetings. The preferences dictionary has the same structure, but with boolean values indicating whether the participant prefers to avoid meetings before a certain time.\n\nThe program then calls the `schedule_meeting` function with the given input and prints the solution."
