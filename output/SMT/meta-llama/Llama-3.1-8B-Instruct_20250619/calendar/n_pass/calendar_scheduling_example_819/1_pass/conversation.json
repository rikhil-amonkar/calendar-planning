You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Julie and Ruth for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJuliehas no meetings the whole week.\nRuth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \n\nJulie would like to avoid more meetings on Thursday before 11:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the days of the week, the start and end times of the workday, and the duration of the meeting. It then defines the constraints for Ruth's and Julie's schedules, as well as Julie's preferences. Finally, it checks if a solution exists and prints the solution if it does."
