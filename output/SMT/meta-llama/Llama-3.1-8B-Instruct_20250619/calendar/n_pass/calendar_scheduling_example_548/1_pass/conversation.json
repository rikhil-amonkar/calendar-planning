You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Judy and Nicole for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJudy is free the entire day.\nNicole has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 16:30; \n\nNicole would rather not meet on Monday before 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `schedule_meeting` function takes the schedules and preferences of Judy and Nicole, as well as the meeting duration, as input and returns a string describing the solution.\n\nThe `schedule_meeting` function first defines the day to meet, start time, and end time as Z3 integers. It then defines the constraints based on the schedules and preferences of Judy and Nicole. The constraints ensure that the start time is within the work hours, the end time is within the work hours, Judy is available, Nicole is available, and Nicole's preferences are satisfied.\n\nThe `schedule_meeting` function then solves the constraints using the Z3 solver. If a solution is found, it returns a string describing the solution in the required format. If no solution is found, it returns 'No solution found'.\n\nThe example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the `schedule_meeting` function with the given constraints."
