You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Carl and Margaret for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nCarl is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, Tuesday during 14:30 to 15:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, Thursday during 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMargaret is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nCarl would like to avoid more meetings on Thursday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the schedules for Carl and Margaret, the meeting duration, the day to schedule the meeting, and the day that Carl wants to avoid. It then uses the Z3 solver to find a solution and prints it out.\n\nNote that the schedules are represented as dictionaries where the keys are the days of the week and the values are lists of tuples representing the start and end times of each busy period. The meeting duration is represented as an integer. The day to schedule the meeting and the day that Carl wants to avoid are represented as strings.\n\nThe Z3 solver is used to create a model of the problem, which is then used to find a solution. The solution is then printed out in the required format."
