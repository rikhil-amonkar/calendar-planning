Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFinancial District to Chinatown: 5.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nChinatown to Financial District: 5.\nChinatown to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nGolden Gate Park to Chinatown: 23.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Financial District at 9:00AM. Kenneth will be at Chinatown from 12:00PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 90 minutes. Barbara will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:15AM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The program defines the travel times between the locations and the constraints for meeting Kenneth and Barbara. The program then optimizes the objective function, which is the total time spent meeting Kenneth and Barbara. The program prints the optimal schedule, which includes the time to meet Kenneth and Barbara at each location."
