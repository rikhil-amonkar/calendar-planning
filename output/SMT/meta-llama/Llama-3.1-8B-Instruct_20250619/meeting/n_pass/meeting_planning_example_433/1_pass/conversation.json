Emily will be at Richmond District from 7:00PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 15 minutes. Margaret will be at Financial District from 4:30PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 75 minutes. Ronald will be at North Beach from 6:30PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 45 minutes. Deborah will be at The Castro from 1:45PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:15AM to 2:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the travel distances, arrival and departure times for each person, and the objective function to maximize the number of meetings. The solver then finds the solution that maximizes the number of meetings while satisfying the constraints.\n\nNote: This code may take some time to run due to the complexity of the problem."
