Helen will be at North Beach from 9:00AM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 15 minutes. Betty will be at Financial District from 7:00PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 90 minutes. Amanda will be at Alamo Square from 7:45PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Amanda for a minimum of 60 minutes. Kevin will be at Mission District from 10:45AM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
