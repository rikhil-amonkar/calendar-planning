It then uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints. The solution is printed out in the format 'Person: Location - HH:MM'.\n\nPlease note that this code may take a long time to run due to the complexity of the problem. Also, the solution may not be unique, and the solver may return different solutions for the same problem.\n\nAlso, note that the times are assumed to be in 24-hour format, and the distances are assumed to be in minutes. If the times are in a different format, the code may need to be modified accordingly."
