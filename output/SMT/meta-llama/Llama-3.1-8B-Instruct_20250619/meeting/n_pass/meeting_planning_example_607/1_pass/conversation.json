The schedule is represented by the `time_slots` variables, which represent the time spent at each location. The constraints are defined using the `s.add` method, and the solution is found using the `s.check` method.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the travel times between locations are represented by the `travel_times` dictionary. The code also assumes that the arrival and departure times for each person are represented by the `karen_arrival`, `karen_departure`, `jessica_arrival`, `jessica_departure`, `matthew_arrival`, `matthew_departure`, `michelle_arrival`, `michelle_departure`, `carol_arrival`, `carol_departure`, `stephanie_arrival`, `stephanie_departure`, and `linda_arrival`, `linda_departure` variables.\n\nThe code also assumes that the meeting times for each person are represented by the `karen_meeting_time`, `jessica_meeting_time`, `matthew_meeting_time`, `michelle_meeting_time`, `carol_meeting_time`, `stephanie_meeting_time`, and `linda_meeting_time` variables.\n\nThe code uses the `If` function to represent the conditional constraints, and the `evaluate` method to get the value of the `time_slots` variables from the model.\n\nThe code prints the solution if it exists, and prints \"NO SOLUTION\" otherwise."
