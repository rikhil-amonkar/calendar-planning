the optimal schedule to meet all friends while minimizing the total travel time. The schedule is represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name of the friend, the start time of the meeting, and the end time of the meeting.\n\nNote that the `locations_visited` list is used to ensure that each location is visited at least once. The `Or` function is used to combine the constraints for each friend, ensuring that the location is visited either when meeting or leaving the friend."
