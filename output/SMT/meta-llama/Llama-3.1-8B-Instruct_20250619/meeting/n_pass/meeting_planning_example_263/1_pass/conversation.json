Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nBayview to Embarcadero: 19.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nEmbarcadero to Bayview: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf: 6.\nEmbarcadero to Financial District: 5.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero: 8.\nFisherman's Wharf to Financial District: 11.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Embarcadero: 4.\nFinancial District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Betty will be at Embarcadero from 7:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 15 minutes. Karen will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:45AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 30 minutes. Anthony will be at Financial District from 9:15AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The decision variables `x` represent whether to visit each location, `y` represent the time to visit each location, and `z` represent the total time spent at each location. The objective function is to maximize the total number of friends met and the total time spent with friends. The constraints are based on the given travel times and the availability of each friend. The solution is printed if a solution exists."
