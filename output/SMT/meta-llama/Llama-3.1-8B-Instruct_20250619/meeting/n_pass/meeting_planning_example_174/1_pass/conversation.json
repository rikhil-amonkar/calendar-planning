Thomas will be at Pacific Heights from 3:30PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Thomas for a minimum of 75 minutes. Kenneth will be at Mission District from 12:00PM to 3:45PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

A more efficient approach would be to use a constraint programming solver or a linear programming solver.\n\nAlso note that this program assumes that the travel times are in minutes and that the meeting times are in minutes. If the travel times and meeting times are in a different unit, the program may need to be modified accordingly."
