Stephanie will be at Mission District from 8:15AM to 1:45PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 90 minutes. Sandra will be at Bayview from 1:00PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 15 minutes. Richard will be at Pacific Heights from 7:15AM to 10:15AM. You'd like to meet Richard for a minimum of 75 minutes. Brian will be at Russian Hill from 12:15PM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 120 minutes. Jason will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:30AM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `travel_distances` dictionary stores the travel times between each location, and the `constraints` list stores the constraints for each person. The program defines the variables `x` as a dictionary of lists of booleans, where each boolean represents a time slot. The program then adds the constraints to the solver, including the travel constraints and the time constraints. Finally, the program solves the problem and prints the schedule if a solution is found."
