Helen will be at Richmond District from 7:45PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 60 minutes. Rebecca will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15PM to 10:15PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 60 minutes. Kimberly will be at Golden Gate Park from 1:00PM to 4:30PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 120 minutes. Kenneth will be at Bayview from 2:30PM to 6:00PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
