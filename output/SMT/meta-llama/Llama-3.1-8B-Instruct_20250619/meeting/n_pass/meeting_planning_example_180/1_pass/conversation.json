Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNorth Beach to Mission District: 18.\nNorth Beach to The Castro: 22.\nMission District to North Beach: 17.\nMission District to The Castro: 7.\nThe Castro to North Beach: 20.\nThe Castro to Mission District: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at North Beach at 9:00AM. James will be at Mission District from 12:45PM to 2:00PM. You'd like to meet James for a minimum of 75 minutes. Robert will be at The Castro from 12:45PM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `x` variables represent the visits to each location, and the `travel_times` dictionary represents the travel times between locations. The `constraints` list contains the constraints for the start and end times, travel times, and meeting times. The `solver` is used to add the constraints and the objective function, and the `solution` is the result of the optimization problem. If a solution is found, the code prints the schedule; otherwise, it prints \"No solution found\".\n\nNote that this code assumes that the travel times are in minutes and that the time step is 15 minutes. The code also assumes that the locations are 'North Beach', 'Mission District', and 'The Castro', and that the travel times between these locations are as specified in the problem statement."
