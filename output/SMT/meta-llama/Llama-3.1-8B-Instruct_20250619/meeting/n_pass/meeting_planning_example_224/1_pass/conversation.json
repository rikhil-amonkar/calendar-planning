However, it may not be the optimal solution. To find the optimal solution, you would need to add more constraints to the solver, such as minimizing the total travel time.\n\nAlso, note that the arrival times are in minutes, and the travel times are in minutes. The solver will find the arrival times that satisfy the constraints.\n\nThis code assumes that the travel times are fixed and do not change based on the arrival times. If the travel times depend on the arrival times, you would need to modify the code to take this into account.\n\nFinally, note that the solver may not find a solution if the constraints are too restrictive. In this case, you would need to modify the constraints to make them more relaxed."
