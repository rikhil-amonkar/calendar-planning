Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nThe Castro to Alamo Square: 8.\nThe Castro to Union Square: 19.\nThe Castro to Chinatown: 20.\nAlamo Square to The Castro: 8.\nAlamo Square to Union Square: 14.\nAlamo Square to Chinatown: 16.\nUnion Square to The Castro: 19.\nUnion Square to Alamo Square: 15.\nUnion Square to Chinatown: 7.\nChinatown to The Castro: 22.\nChinatown to Alamo Square: 17.\nChinatown to Union Square: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at The Castro at 9:00AM. Emily will be at Alamo Square from 11:45AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 105 minutes. Barbara will be at Union Square from 4:45PM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 60 minutes. William will be at Chinatown from 5:15PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the variables and constraints, then solves the problem and prints the schedule. The schedule is represented as a dictionary where the keys are the friends and the values are lists of locations where the friend will be met.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the arrival and departure times of the friends are exact, and that the travel times between locations are also exact. In a real-world scenario, you would need to take into account the uncertainty of these times and adjust the schedule accordingly.\n\nAlso, this program does not optimize the schedule for the minimum travel time. If you want to optimize the schedule for the minimum travel time, you would need to add additional constraints to the solver."
