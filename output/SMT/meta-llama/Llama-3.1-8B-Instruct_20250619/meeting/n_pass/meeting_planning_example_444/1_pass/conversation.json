Ronald will be at Russian Hill from 1:45PM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 105 minutes. Patricia will be at Sunset District from 9:15AM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 60 minutes. Laura will be at North Beach from 12:30PM to 12:45PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 15 minutes. Emily will be at The Castro from 4:15PM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 60 minutes. Mary will be at Golden Gate Park from 3:00PM to 4:30PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
