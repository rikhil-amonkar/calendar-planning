It first defines the variables and constraints for each friend, including the meeting time and duration. It then adds constraints to ensure that each friend is met for at least the required duration. Finally, it adds a constraint to minimize the total travel time between meetings.\n\nThe program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal solution. It first tries to meet each friend at their earliest possible time, and then adjusts the meeting times to minimize the total travel time.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the travel times between meetings are symmetric, i.e., the travel time from meeting i to meeting j is the same as the travel time from meeting j to meeting i. If this is not the case, the program will need to be modified accordingly."
