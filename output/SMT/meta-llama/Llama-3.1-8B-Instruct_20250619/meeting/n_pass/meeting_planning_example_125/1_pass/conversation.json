Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nEmbarcadero to Financial District: 5.\nEmbarcadero to Alamo Square: 19.\nFinancial District to Embarcadero: 4.\nFinancial District to Alamo Square: 17.\nAlamo Square to Embarcadero: 17.\nAlamo Square to Financial District: 17.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Embarcadero at 9:00AM. Stephanie will be at Financial District from 8:15AM to 11:30AM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 90 minutes. John will be at Alamo Square from 10:15AM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet John for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
