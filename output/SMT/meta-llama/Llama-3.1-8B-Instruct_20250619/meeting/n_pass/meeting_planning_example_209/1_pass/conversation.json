Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nSunset District to Chinatown: 30.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to North Beach: 29.\nChinatown to Sunset District: 29.\nChinatown to Russian Hill: 7.\nChinatown to North Beach: 3.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to Chinatown: 9.\nRussian Hill to North Beach: 5.\nNorth Beach to Sunset District: 27.\nNorth Beach to Chinatown: 6.\nNorth Beach to Russian Hill: 4.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM. Anthony will be at Chinatown from 1:15PM to 2:30PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 60 minutes. Rebecca will be at Russian Hill from 7:30PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 105 minutes. Melissa will be at North Beach from 8:15AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the variables and constraints, then defines the schedule as a list of time slots. It then adds constraints to the solver to ensure the schedule meets all the constraints. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the schedule if a solution is found."
