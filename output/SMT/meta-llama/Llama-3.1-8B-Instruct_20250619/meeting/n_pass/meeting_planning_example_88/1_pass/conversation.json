The optimal schedule is then printed out.\n\nNote that the `Optimize` function in Z3 is used to define the objective function, which is the total travel time in this case. The `maximize` function is used to maximize the objective function, which is equivalent to minimizing the total travel time.\n\nThe constraints are defined using the `add` function, which adds a constraint to the solver. The constraints include the fact that the decision variables `x` and `y` are boolean, and that they represent the start and end times of the trips, respectively.\n\nThe Joshua's meeting time constraint is defined using the `Implies` function, which implies that if the trip from Sunset District to Golden Gate Park starts at time `i` and the trip from Golden Gate Park to Sunset District starts at time `i`, then the trip must start at least `min_meeting_time` minutes after Joshua's start time.\n\nFinally, the `check` function is used to check if the problem is satisfiable, and if it is, the `model` function is used to get the model of the solution, which is then used to print out the optimal schedule."
