Laura will be at Mission District from 12:15PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 75 minutes. Anthony will be at Financial District from 12:30PM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The `Optimize` class is used to define the optimization problem, and the `check` method is used to solve the problem. The `model` object contains the optimal values for the variables, which are then printed out.\n\nNote that the travel times are added as constraints to ensure that the schedule is feasible. The `And` function is used to combine multiple constraints into a single constraint. The `sat` constant is used to check if the solution is satisfiable. If the solution is satisfiable, the `model` object is used to print out the optimal values for the variables."
