Jessica will be at Golden Gate Park from 1:45PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 30 minutes. Ashley will be at Bayview from 5:15PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 105 minutes. Ronald will be at Chinatown from 7:15AM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 90 minutes. William will be at North Beach from 1:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 15 minutes. Daniel will be at Mission District from 7:00AM to 11:15AM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It uses the Z3 solver to find the optimal schedule. The schedule is printed out in hours and minutes.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the travel times are in minutes and the meeting times are in hours and minutes. Also, the code assumes that the start and end times are inclusive.\n\nThe code defines the travel times, time constraints, and meeting requirements. It then creates the solver and defines the variables. The constraints are defined using the Z3 solver. The solver is then used to find the optimal schedule. The schedule is printed out in hours and minutes.\n\nThis code should be run in a Python environment with the Z3 solver installed."
