solver to find a solution to the scheduling problem. The solution is printed to the console, indicating which locations to visit and which to avoid. If no solution is found, a message is printed indicating that.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the times are given in minutes past 9:00 AM, and that the meeting times are given as start and end times in minutes past 9:00 AM. The code also assumes that the travel times are not given, so it does not take them into account when finding the solution.\n\nAlso note that this code uses a brute-force approach to find the solution, which may not be efficient for large instances of the problem. There are more efficient algorithms available, such as the Hungarian algorithm, but they are more complex to implement."
