Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nBayview to Pacific Heights: 23.\nBayview to Mission District: 13.\nBayview to Haight-Ashbury: 19.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nPacific Heights to Bayview: 22.\nPacific Heights to Mission District: 15.\nPacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury: 11.\nPacific Heights to Financial District: 13.\nMission District to Bayview: 15.\nMission District to Pacific Heights: 16.\nMission District to Haight-Ashbury: 12.\nMission District to Financial District: 17.\nHaight-Ashbury to Bayview: 18.\nHaight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights: 12.\nHaight-Ashbury to Mission District: 11.\nHaight-Ashbury to Financial District: 21.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Pacific Heights: 13.\nFinancial District to Mission District: 17.\nFinancial District to Haight-Ashbury: 19.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Mary will be at Pacific Heights from 10:00AM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 45 minutes. Lisa will be at Mission District from 8:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Lisa for a minimum of 75 minutes. Betty will be at Haight-Ashbury from 7:15AM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 90 minutes. Charles will be at Financial District from 11:15AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the travel times and the constraints. Then it defines the variables and the objective function. The objective function is to maximize the total time spent visiting the locations. The constraints are:\n\n* The start time is 0 and the end time is 24 hours in minutes.\n* The time spent visiting each location is at least the minimum required time.\n* The time spent visiting each location is at most the time spent visiting the next location.\n* The time spent visiting each location is at least the time spent traveling to the next location.\n* The time spent visiting each location is at most the end time minus the time spent traveling to the next location.\n* The time spent visiting each location is at least the minimum required time.\n* The time spent visiting each location is at most the end time.\n* The time spent visiting each location is at least the time spent traveling to the next location.\n* The time spent visiting each location is at most the end time minus the time spent traveling to the next location.\n* The time spent visiting each location is at least the minimum required time.\n\nThe program then solves the problem using the Z3 solver and prints the optimal schedule and the total time spent visiting the locations."
