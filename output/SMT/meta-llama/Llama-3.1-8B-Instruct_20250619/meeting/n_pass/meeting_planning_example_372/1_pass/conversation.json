Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nSunset District to Alamo Square: 17.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nSunset District to Mission District: 24.\nAlamo Square to Sunset District: 16.\nAlamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nAlamo Square to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nAlamo Square to Mission District: 10.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\nRussian Hill to Mission District: 16.\nGolden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nGolden Gate Park to Mission District: 17.\nMission District to Sunset District: 24.\nMission District to Alamo Square: 11.\nMission District to Russian Hill: 15.\nMission District to Golden Gate Park: 17.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM. Charles will be at Alamo Square from 6:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 90 minutes. Margaret will be at Russian Hill from 9:00AM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 30 minutes. Daniel will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:00AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 15 minutes. Stephanie will be at Mission District from 8:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
