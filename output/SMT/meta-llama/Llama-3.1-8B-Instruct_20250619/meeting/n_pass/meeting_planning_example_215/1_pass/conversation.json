Jessica will be at Embarcadero from 4:45PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 30 minutes. Sandra will be at Richmond District from 6:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 120 minutes. Jason will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:00PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The code uses the Z3 solver to find the optimal schedule.\n\nThe code first defines the travel times between locations, then defines the constraints for each friend. The constraints are added to the solver, and the solver is then checked to find the solution.\n\nFinally, the code prints the solution, which includes the location and time of each transition.\n\nPlease note that this is a complex problem, and the solution may not be optimal in all cases. The Z3 solver may take a long time to find the solution, or it may not be able to find a solution at all."
