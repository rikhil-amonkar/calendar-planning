The `x` variables represent whether a friend is available during the day, the `y` variables represent whether a friend is visited, and the `z` variables represent whether a friend is visited for at least the minimum required time. The constraints are defined to ensure that the friends are visited for at least the minimum required time, and that the friends are visited in a way that minimizes the total travel time.\n\nPlease note that this is a complex problem and the solution may not be optimal. The Z3 solver may take a long time to find a solution, or it may not find a solution at all. You may need to adjust the constraints or the model to get a better solution."
