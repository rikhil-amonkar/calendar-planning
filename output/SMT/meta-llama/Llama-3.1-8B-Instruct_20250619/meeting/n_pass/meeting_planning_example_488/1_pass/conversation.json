The `Optimize` solver is used to find the minimum value of the objective function, which is the sum of the travel times.\n\nThe program defines the variables and constraints as specified in the problem. The `x`, `y`, `z`, and `t` variables represent the start time, end time, location, and travel time for each friend, respectively.\n\nThe program then adds the constraints for each friend, including the start and end time constraints, the meeting time constraints, and the travel time constraints.\n\nFinally, the program solves the optimization problem and prints the solution if it exists. The solution is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the friend's name, start time, end time, location, and travel time.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the travel times are symmetric, i.e., the travel time from location A to location B is the same as the travel time from location B to location A. If this is not the case, the program will need to be modified accordingly."
