David will be at Chinatown from 4:00PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

This schedule meets the constraints and minimizes the start time.\n\nNote: The Z3 solver may take some time to find the optimal solution due to the complexity of the problem. You can adjust the solver settings to improve performance."
