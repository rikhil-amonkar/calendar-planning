optimal due to the large number of possible routes and the constraints. The solution found by the Z3 solver may not be the optimal one.\n\nAlso, please note that the solution is in the format of \"Locations: Location1 -> Location2\" where Location1 and Location2 are the locations that are connected by the route. The total time is the sum of the times for all the routes.\n\nThis solution assumes that the travel time is the same in both directions, which may not be the case in reality. Also, this solution does not take into account the time of day and the availability of the people at each location, which may affect the optimal solution.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, you would need to use a more advanced algorithm or a more sophisticated solver to find the optimal solution."
