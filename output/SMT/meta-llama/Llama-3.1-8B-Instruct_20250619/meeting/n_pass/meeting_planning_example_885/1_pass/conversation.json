It then defines the constraints, including the arrival time at Russian Hill and the meeting times for each person. The minimum meeting times are also defined. The variables are then defined, and the constraints are added to the solver. Finally, the solver is solved, and the solution is printed.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the arrival time at Russian Hill is 9:00 AM. If this is not the case, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that the meeting times are in the format of hours and minutes. If the meeting times are in a different format, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nThis code also assumes that the minimum meeting times are in minutes. If the minimum meeting times are in a different unit, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nFinally, this code assumes that the travel times are in minutes. If the travel times are in a different unit, you will need to adjust the code accordingly."
