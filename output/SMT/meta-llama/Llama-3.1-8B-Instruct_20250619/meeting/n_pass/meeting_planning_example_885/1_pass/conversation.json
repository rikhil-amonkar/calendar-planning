It defines the locations, travel times, and constraints for each friend. It then adds constraints for meeting durations, travel times, and visiting each location. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the solution. Note that this code assumes that the travel times are symmetric, i.e., the travel time from location A to location B is the same as the travel time from location B to location A. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code accordingly."
