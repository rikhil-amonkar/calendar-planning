We then define the constraints for the problem, including the start time, end time, and meet time. We also define the travel times between Richmond District and Russian Hill.\n\nWe then define the objective function, which is to minimize the total time spent traveling and meeting Daniel. We use the `Obj` function to define the objective function, and we add it to the solver.\n\nFinally, we solve the optimization problem using the `check` function, and we print the result if a solution is found."
