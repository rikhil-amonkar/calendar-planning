Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nBayview to Russian Hill: 23.\nBayview to Alamo Square: 16.\nBayview to North Beach: 21.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nRussian Hill to Bayview: 23.\nRussian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\nRussian Hill to North Beach: 5.\nRussian Hill to Financial District: 11.\nAlamo Square to Bayview: 16.\nAlamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nAlamo Square to North Beach: 15.\nAlamo Square to Financial District: 17.\nNorth Beach to Bayview: 22.\nNorth Beach to Russian Hill: 4.\nNorth Beach to Alamo Square: 16.\nNorth Beach to Financial District: 8.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Russian Hill: 10.\nFinancial District to Alamo Square: 17.\nFinancial District to North Beach: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Joseph will be at Russian Hill from 8:30AM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 60 minutes. Nancy will be at Alamo Square from 11:00AM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jason will be at North Beach from 4:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 15 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Financial District from 10:30AM to 3:45PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
