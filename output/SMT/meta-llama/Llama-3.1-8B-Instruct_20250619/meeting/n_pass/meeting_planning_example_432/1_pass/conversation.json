Joseph will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00AM to 5:30PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Bayview from 5:30PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 60 minutes. Kevin will be at Mission District from 11:15AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 30 minutes. David will be at Embarcadero from 8:15AM to 9:00AM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 30 minutes. Barbara will be at Financial District from 10:30AM to 4:30PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
