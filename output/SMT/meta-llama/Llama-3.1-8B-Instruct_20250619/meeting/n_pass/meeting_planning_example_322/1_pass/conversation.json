William will be at Russian Hill from 6:30PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 105 minutes. Michelle will be at Chinatown from 8:15AM to 2:00PM. You'd like to meet Michelle for a minimum of 15 minutes. George will be at Presidio from 10:30AM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet George for a minimum of 30 minutes. Robert will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:00AM to 1:45PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

It defines the locations, travel times, and constraints for each person. The objective function is to minimize the number of locations visited. The program then solves the optimization problem and prints the solution.\n\nNote that the solution may not be unique, and the program may print multiple solutions. The program also assumes that the travel times are given in minutes and that the constraints are given in the format specified in the problem statement."
