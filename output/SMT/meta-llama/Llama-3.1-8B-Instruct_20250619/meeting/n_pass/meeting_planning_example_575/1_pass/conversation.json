It defines the travel times between locations and the constraints for each friend. It then defines the variables and constraints for the problem, including the implications for each friend's meeting time. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the solution.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the travel times are in minutes and that the start and end times are in minutes. It also assumes that the friends' meeting times are in the format [start_time, end_time]. The solution is printed in the format 'Meet friend at location at start_time and stay for meeting_time minutes'."
