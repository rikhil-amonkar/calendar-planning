Kimberly will be at Marina District from 1:15PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 15 minutes. Robert will be at Chinatown from 12:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 15 minutes. Rebecca will be at Financial District from 1:15PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 75 minutes. Margaret will be at Bayview from 9:30AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 30 minutes. Kenneth will be at Union Square from 7:30PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

It defines the travel distances between locations, the time windows for each friend, and the meeting duration for each friend. It then defines the constraints for the problem, including the constraints for meeting each friend. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the optimal schedule if a solution is found."
