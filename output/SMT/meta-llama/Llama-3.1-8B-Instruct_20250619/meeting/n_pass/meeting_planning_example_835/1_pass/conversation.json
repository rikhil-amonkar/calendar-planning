The schedule is represented by three variables for each location: the start time, the end time, and the total time spent at the location. The constraints are defined to ensure that the schedule is valid and meets all the requirements. The solver is then used to find a solution to the problem, and the solution is printed out.\n\nNote that this is a complex problem, and the solution may not be unique. The Z3 solver may find multiple solutions, or it may not find any solution at all. In this case, the code will print out the first solution it finds."
