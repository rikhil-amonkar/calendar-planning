Kenneth will be at Nob Hill from 2:15PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

If a solution is found, it prints the optimal schedule. Then it checks for an optimal schedule by iterating over all possible schedules and finds the one with the minimum travel time. If an optimal schedule is found, it prints the optimal schedule.\n\nSOLUTION: \nOptimal schedule: Leave Fisherman's Wharf at 12:00 PM, meet Kenneth at Nob Hill at 4:45 PM"
