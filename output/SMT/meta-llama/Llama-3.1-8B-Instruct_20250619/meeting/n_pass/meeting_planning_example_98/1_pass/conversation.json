Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nAlamo Square to Richmond District: 12.\nRichmond District to Alamo Square: 13.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Alamo Square at 9:00AM. Timothy will be at Richmond District from 8:45PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Timothy for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the variables and constraints, then adds the constraints to the solver. The solver is then checked, and the solution is printed out. If the solution is to visit Richmond District, the schedule is printed out. Otherwise, a default schedule is printed out."
