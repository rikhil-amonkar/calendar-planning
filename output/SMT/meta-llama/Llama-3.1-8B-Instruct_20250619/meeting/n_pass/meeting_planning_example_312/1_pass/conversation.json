Sarah will be at Sunset District from 10:45AM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 30 minutes. Richard will be at Haight-Ashbury from 11:45AM to 3:45PM. You'd like to meet Richard for a minimum of 90 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Mission District from 11:00AM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 120 minutes. Michelle will be at Golden Gate Park from 6:15PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Michelle for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
