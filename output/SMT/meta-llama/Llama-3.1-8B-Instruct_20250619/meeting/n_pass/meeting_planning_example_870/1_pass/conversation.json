It then defines the constraints for each person and creates a Z3 solver to solve the constraints. The solution is then printed out.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the start and end times are in hours and minutes, and that the travel times are in minutes. Also, the code assumes that the minimum meeting time is in minutes.\n\nAlso, the code uses a simple greedy algorithm to find the solution. It first checks if the person is available at the start time, and if so, it tries to meet the person at that time. If not, it tries to meet the person at the end time. If the person is not available at either the start or end time, it tries to meet the person at a time that is within the travel time from the start or end time.\n\nThis algorithm may not always find the optimal solution, especially if there are many people to meet and the travel times are long. In such cases, a more sophisticated algorithm such as a genetic algorithm or a simulated annealing algorithm may be needed to find the optimal solution."
