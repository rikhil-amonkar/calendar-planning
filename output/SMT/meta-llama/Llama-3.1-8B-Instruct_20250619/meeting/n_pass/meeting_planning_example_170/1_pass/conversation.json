Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNorth Beach to Union Square: 7.\nNorth Beach to Russian Hill: 4.\nUnion Square to North Beach: 10.\nUnion Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nRussian Hill to North Beach: 5.\nRussian Hill to Union Square: 11.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at North Beach at 9:00AM. Emily will be at Union Square from 4:00PM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 45 minutes. Margaret will be at Russian Hill from 7:00PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
