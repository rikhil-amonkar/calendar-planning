Jeffrey will be at Presidio from 8:00AM to 10:00AM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 105 minutes. Steven will be at North Beach from 1:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 45 minutes. Barbara will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 6:00PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 30 minutes. John will be at Pacific Heights from 9:00AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet John for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
