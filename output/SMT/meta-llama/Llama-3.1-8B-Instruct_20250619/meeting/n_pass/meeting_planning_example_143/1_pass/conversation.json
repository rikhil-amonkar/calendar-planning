Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNorth Beach to Pacific Heights: 8.\nNorth Beach to Embarcadero: 6.\nPacific Heights to North Beach: 9.\nPacific Heights to Embarcadero: 10.\nEmbarcadero to North Beach: 5.\nEmbarcadero to Pacific Heights: 11.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at North Beach at 9:00AM. Karen will be at Pacific Heights from 6:45PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 90 minutes. Mark will be at Embarcadero from 1:00PM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The program defines the travel times, constraints, and variables, and then uses the `Optimize` class to define the optimization problem. The `minimize` method is used to define the objective function, which is the total travel time. The `check` method is used to solve the optimization problem, and the solution is printed out.\n\nNote that the program assumes that the travel times are in minutes, and that the arrival time is 9:00 AM. The program also assumes that the visit times with Karen and Mark are at least the minimum required times. The program prints out the visit times with Pacific Heights and Embarcadero, the leave time, and the visit times with Karen and Mark.\n\nPlease note that the solution may not always be optimal due to the complexity of the problem and the limitations of the Z3 solver."
