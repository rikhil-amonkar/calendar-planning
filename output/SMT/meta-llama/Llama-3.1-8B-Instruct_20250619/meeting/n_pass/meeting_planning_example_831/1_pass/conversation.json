It is used here to represent the variable that indicates whether a person is at a particular location at a particular time. The actual implementation of this function would depend on the specific requirements of the problem.\n\nAlso, the `travel_distances` dictionary is used to represent the travel times between different locations. The actual implementation of this dictionary would depend on the specific requirements of the problem.\n\nFinally, the `constraints` list is used to represent the constraints of the problem. The actual implementation of this list would depend on the specific requirements of the problem.\n\nThis code will output the schedule that satisfies all the constraints. If no solution is found, it will print \"No solution found\"."
