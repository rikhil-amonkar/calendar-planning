Mary will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:45AM to 11:45AM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 45 minutes. Kevin will be at Haight-Ashbury from 10:15AM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 90 minutes. Deborah will be at Bayview from 3:00PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 120 minutes. Stephanie will be at Presidio from 10:00AM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 120 minutes. Emily will be at Financial District from 11:30AM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
