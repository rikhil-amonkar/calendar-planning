Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nPacific Heights to Presidio: 11.\nPacific Heights to Marina District: 6.\nPresidio to Pacific Heights: 11.\nPresidio to Marina District: 10.\nMarina District to Pacific Heights: 7.\nMarina District to Presidio: 10.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Pacific Heights at 9:00AM. Jason will be at Presidio from 10:00AM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 90 minutes. Kenneth will be at Marina District from 3:30PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the variables, objective function, and constraints, and then solves the problem. The optimal schedule is printed out if a solution is found.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that the travel times are given in minutes, and the meeting times are given in minutes. The program also assumes that the start time is 9:00AM and the end time is 4:45PM.\n\nAlso, the program uses the `Optimize` solver from Z3, which is a more efficient solver for optimization problems than the `SatSolver`. The `Optimize` solver returns the optimal solution, which is the solution that maximizes the objective function.\n\nThe program uses the `Sum` function to calculate the objective function, which is the sum of the meeting times. The `maximize` function is used to maximize the objective function.\n\nThe program also uses the `check` function to check if a solution exists, and the `model` function to get the solution.\n\nFinally, the program prints out the optimal schedule if a solution is found."
