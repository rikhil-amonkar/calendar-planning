Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nPacific Heights to Presidio: 11.\nPacific Heights to Marina District: 6.\nPresidio to Pacific Heights: 11.\nPresidio to Marina District: 10.\nMarina District to Pacific Heights: 7.\nMarina District to Presidio: 10.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Pacific Heights at 9:00AM. Jason will be at Presidio from 10:00AM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 90 minutes. Kenneth will be at Marina District from 3:30PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `Optimize` class is used to define the objective function, which is the sum of the times spent at each location. The `Maximize` method is used to maximize this objective function. The `add` method is used to add the constraints to the solver. The `check` method is used to check if the solver found a solution. If a solution is found, the `model` object is used to get the optimal values of the variables."
