The schedule is represented as a list of times, where each time is the minute at which a location should be visited. The code first defines the travel distances between locations and then adds constraints for each person's availability and travel times. Finally, it checks the solution and prints out the schedule if one exists.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the travel times are symmetric, i.e., the time it takes to travel from location A to location B is the same as the time it takes to travel from location B to location A. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, note that this code does not guarantee an optimal solution, it just finds a solution that meets all the constraints. If you need to find an optimal solution, you may need to use a more advanced algorithm or a different solver."
