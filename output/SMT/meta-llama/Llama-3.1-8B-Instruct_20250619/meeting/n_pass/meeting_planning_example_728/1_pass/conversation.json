The `distances` dictionary contains the travel times between each pair of locations. The `meeting_times` dictionary contains the start and end times for each person's availability. The `min_meeting_times` dictionary contains the minimum meeting times required for each person.\n\nThe code defines the variables `x` to represent the time at each location, and adds constraints to ensure that the time at each location is non-decreasing and within the valid range. It also adds constraints to ensure that the travel time between each pair of locations is accounted for.\n\nFinally, it adds constraints to ensure that the meeting times for each person are satisfied. The `s.check()` function is used to solve the problem, and the `model` variable contains the solution.\n\nThe solution is printed out in a human-readable format, showing the location and time for each step of the schedule."
