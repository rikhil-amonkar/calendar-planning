Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nEmbarcadero to Presidio: 20.\nEmbarcadero to Richmond District: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf: 6.\nPresidio to Embarcadero: 20.\nPresidio to Richmond District: 7.\nPresidio to Fisherman's Wharf: 19.\nRichmond District to Embarcadero: 19.\nRichmond District to Presidio: 7.\nRichmond District to Fisherman's Wharf: 18.\nFisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero: 8.\nFisherman's Wharf to Presidio: 17.\nFisherman's Wharf to Richmond District: 18.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Embarcadero at 9:00AM. Betty will be at Presidio from 10:15AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 45 minutes. David will be at Richmond District from 1:00PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 90 minutes. Barbara will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15AM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
