Betty will be at Presidio from 10:15AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 45 minutes. David will be at Richmond District from 1:00PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 90 minutes. Barbara will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15AM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The constraints are defined such that the meeting times are within the allowed time frames for each location, and the meeting durations are met. The solver is then used to find the optimal schedule. The optimal schedule is printed out, along with the total duration of the schedule."
