code uses the Z3 solver to find the optimal schedule for meeting all friends. The solver takes into account the arrival and departure times of each friend, the travel times between locations, and the minimum meeting times required for each friend. The solution is printed out, showing the location to meet each friend and the time of the meeting.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the travel times are symmetric, i.e., the travel time from location A to location B is the same as the travel time from location B to location A. If this is not the case, the code needs to be modified accordingly.\n\nAlso note that this code uses a brute-force approach to find the optimal schedule. This may not be efficient for large numbers of friends or locations. In such cases, a more efficient algorithm or heuristic may be needed."
