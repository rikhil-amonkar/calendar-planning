You want to spend 2 days in Krakow. You are going to attend a wedding in Krakow between day 9 and day 10. You plan to stay in Dubrovnik for 7 days. You would like to visit Frankfurt for 3 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nFrankfurt and Krakow, Dubrovnik and Frankfurt.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 10 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then solves the optimization problem and prints the solution. The solution is represented as a list of cities visited on each day of the trip. The program assumes that the user wants to visit the cities in the order that minimizes the number of days spent in Krakow.\n\nNote: The above code is a simple implementation and might not be efficient for large inputs. It's also worth noting that Z3 is a powerful SMT solver and might not be the best choice for this specific problem. A more efficient solution might be to use a constraint programming library or to implement a custom algorithm."
