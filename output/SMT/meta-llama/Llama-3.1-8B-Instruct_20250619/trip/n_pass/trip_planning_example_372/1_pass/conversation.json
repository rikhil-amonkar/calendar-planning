You plan to stay in Seville for 2 days. You plan to stay in Stuttgart for 7 days. During day 7 and day 13, you have to attend a conference in Stuttgart. You would like to visit Porto for 3 days. You would like to visit Madrid for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Madrid between day 1 and day 4.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPorto and Stuttgart, Seville and Porto, Madrid and Porto, Madrid and Seville.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 13 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
