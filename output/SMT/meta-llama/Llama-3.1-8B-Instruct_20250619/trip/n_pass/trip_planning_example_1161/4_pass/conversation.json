You would like to visit Mykonos for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Mykonos between day 15 and day 18. You would like to visit Krakow for 5 days. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 2 days. You want to spend 2 days in Helsinki. You want to spend 3 days in Dubrovnik. From day 2 to day 4, there is a annual show you want to attend in Dubrovnik. You want to spend 2 days in Oslo. You would like to meet your friends at Oslo between day 1 and day 2 to tour together. You want to spend 5 days in Madrid. You would like to visit Paris for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nOslo and Krakow, Oslo and Paris, Paris and Madrid, Helsinki and Vilnius, Oslo and Madrid, Oslo and Helsinki, Helsinki and Krakow, Dubrovnik and Helsinki, Dubrovnik and Madrid, Oslo and Dubrovnik, Krakow and Paris, Madrid and Mykonos, Oslo and Vilnius, from Krakow to Vilnius, Helsinki and Paris, Vilnius and Paris, Helsinki and Madrid.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 18 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
