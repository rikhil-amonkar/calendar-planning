You plan to stay in Riga for 5 days. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 7 days. You would like to visit Dublin for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nDublin and Riga, from Riga to Vilnius.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then defines the constraints based on the problem statement and checks if the solution satisfies all constraints using the `check` method of the solver. If a solution is found, it prints the number of days spent in each city. If no solution is found, it prints a message indicating that."
