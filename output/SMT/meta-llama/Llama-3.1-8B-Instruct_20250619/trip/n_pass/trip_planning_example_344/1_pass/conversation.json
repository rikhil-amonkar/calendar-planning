You want to spend 6 days in Valencia. You want to spend 6 days in Athens. You plan to visit relatives in Athens between day 1 and day 6. You would like to visit Naples for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Naples between day 16 and day 20. You want to spend 6 days in Zurich.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nValencia and Naples, from Valencia to Athens, Athens and Naples, Zurich and Naples, Athens and Zurich, Zurich and Valencia.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
