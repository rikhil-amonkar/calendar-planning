You plan to stay in London for 3 days. You would like to visit Santorini for 6 days. During day 5 and day 10, you have to attend a conference in Santorini. You want to spend 3 days in Istanbul.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nIstanbul and London, London and Santorini.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 10 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The solver checks for each day whether there is a flight between each pair of cities, and whether each city has at least the required number of days. The conference days are already counted in the stays, so the solver only needs to check for flights on those days. The solver will find a valid schedule if one exists."
