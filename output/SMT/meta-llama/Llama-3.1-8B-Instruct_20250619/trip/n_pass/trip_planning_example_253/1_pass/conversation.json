You want to spend 3 days in Amsterdam. You have to attend a workshop in Amsterdam between day 9 and day 11. You would like to visit Vienna for 7 days. You want to spend 4 days in Santorini. You want to spend 3 days in Lyon. You are going to attend a wedding in Lyon between day 7 and day 9.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nVienna and Lyon, Vienna and Santorini, Vienna and Amsterdam, Amsterdam and Santorini, Lyon and Amsterdam.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 14 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
