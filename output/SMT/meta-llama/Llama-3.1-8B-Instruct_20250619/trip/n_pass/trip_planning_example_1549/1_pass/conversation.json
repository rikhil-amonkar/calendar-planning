You want to spend 5 days in Prague. You would like to visit Tallinn for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Tallinn between day 18 and day 20. You plan to stay in Warsaw for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Porto. You plan to stay in Naples for 5 days. You plan to stay in Milan for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Milan between day 24 and day 26. You would like to visit Lisbon for 5 days. You plan to stay in Santorini for 5 days. You plan to stay in Riga for 4 days. From day 5 to day 8, there is a annual show you want to attend in Riga. You would like to visit Stockholm for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nRiga and Prague, Stockholm and Milan, Riga and Milan, Lisbon and Stockholm, from Stockholm to Santorini, Naples and Warsaw, Lisbon and Warsaw, Naples and Milan, Lisbon and Naples, from Riga to Tallinn, Tallinn and Prague, Stockholm and Warsaw, Riga and Warsaw, Lisbon and Riga, Riga and Stockholm, Lisbon and Porto, Lisbon and Prague, Milan and Porto, Prague and Milan, Lisbon and Milan, Warsaw and Porto, Warsaw and Tallinn, Santorini and Milan, Stockholm and Prague, Stockholm and Tallinn, Warsaw and Milan, Santorini and Naples, Warsaw and Prague.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 28 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The trip plan is stored in the `trip_plan` dictionary, where the key is the day number and the value is a tuple containing the day number and the city number. The city name can be obtained by looking up the city number in the `cities` dictionary.\n\nPlease note that this code may take a long time to run, especially if there are many constraints. Also, the solution may not be optimal, as the Z3 solver uses a SAT solver under the hood, which may not find the optimal solution.\n\nAlso, please note that this code assumes that the cities are numbered from 0 to 9, and the days are numbered from 0 to 27. If the cities or days are numbered differently, the code will need to be modified accordingly."
