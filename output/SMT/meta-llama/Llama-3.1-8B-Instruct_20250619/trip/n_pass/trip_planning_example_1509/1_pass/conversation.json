You want to meet a friend in Helsinki between day 18 and day 22. You plan to stay in Oslo for 5 days. You want to spend 2 days in Santorini. You plan to visit relatives in Santorini between day 12 and day 13. You plan to stay in Lyon for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nWarsaw and Riga, Warsaw and Tallinn, Copenhagen and Helsinki, Lyon and Paris, Copenhagen and Warsaw, Lyon and Oslo, Paris and Oslo, Paris and Riga, Krakow and Helsinki, Paris and Tallinn, Oslo and Riga, Krakow and Warsaw, Paris and Helsinki, Copenhagen and Santorini, Helsinki and Warsaw, Helsinki and Riga, Copenhagen and Krakow, Copenhagen and Riga, Paris and Krakow, Copenhagen and Oslo, Oslo and Tallinn, Oslo and Helsinki, Copenhagen and Tallinn, Oslo and Krakow, from Riga to Tallinn, Helsinki and Tallinn, Paris and Copenhagen, Paris and Warsaw, from Santorini to Oslo, Oslo and Warsaw.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
