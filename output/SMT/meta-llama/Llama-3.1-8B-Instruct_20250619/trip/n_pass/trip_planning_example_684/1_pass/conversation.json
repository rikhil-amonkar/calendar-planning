You plan to stay in Amsterdam for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Amsterdam between day 5 and day 8. You plan to stay in Edinburgh for 5 days. You want to spend 5 days in Brussels. You want to spend 5 days in Vienna. You plan to stay in Berlin for 4 days. You want to meet a friend in Berlin between day 16 and day 19. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 5 days. You have to attend a workshop in Reykjavik between day 12 and day 16.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nEdinburgh and Berlin, Amsterdam and Berlin, Edinburgh and Amsterdam, Vienna and Berlin, Berlin and Brussels, Vienna and Reykjavik, Edinburgh and Brussels, Vienna and Brussels, Amsterdam and Reykjavik, Reykjavik and Brussels, Amsterdam and Vienna, Reykjavik and Berlin.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 23 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the cities, their corresponding days, and the direct flights. Then, it defines the variables and constraints. The constraints ensure that each day is associated with a city, each city has a fixed number of days, direct flights are taken, and relatives and friends are visited. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the result."
