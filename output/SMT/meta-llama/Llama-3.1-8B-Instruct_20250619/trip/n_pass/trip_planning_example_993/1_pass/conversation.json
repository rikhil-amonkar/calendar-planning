You would like to visit Riga for 2 days. You would like to visit Frankfurt for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Amsterdam. You want to meet a friend in Amsterdam between day 2 and day 3. You would like to visit Vilnius for 5 days. You have to attend a workshop in Vilnius between day 7 and day 11. You want to spend 2 days in London. You want to spend 3 days in Stockholm. You are going to attend a wedding in Stockholm between day 13 and day 15. You would like to visit Bucharest for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLondon and Amsterdam, Vilnius and Frankfurt, from Riga to Vilnius, Riga and Stockholm, London and Bucharest, Amsterdam and Stockholm, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, Frankfurt and Stockholm, Bucharest and Riga, Amsterdam and Riga, Amsterdam and Bucharest, Riga and Frankfurt, Bucharest and Frankfurt, London and Frankfurt, London and Stockholm, Amsterdam and Vilnius.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 15 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `cities` dictionary stores the duration of each city, and the `flights` set stores the direct flights between cities. The `days` variable stores the total number of days, and the `constraints` list stores the constraints for each city and flight.\n\nThe program initializes the solver, defines the variables, and adds the constraints to the solver. It then adds the workshop and wedding constraints, solves the problem, and prints the solution.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the direct flights are bidirectional, and that the durations are non-negative integers. If the durations can be negative or non-integer, additional constraints may be needed.\n\nAlso note that this program uses a brute-force approach to find the solution, which may not be efficient for large numbers of cities and flights. In such cases, more advanced algorithms or heuristics may be needed to find the solution efficiently."
