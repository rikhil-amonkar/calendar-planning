During day 27 and day 28, you have to attend a conference in Mykonos. You would like to visit Naples for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Naples between day 5 and day 8. You plan to stay in Prague for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Dubrovnik. You want to spend 4 days in Athens. You have to attend a workshop in Athens between day 8 and day 11. You plan to stay in Santorini for 5 days. You would like to visit Brussels for 4 days. You would like to visit Munich for 5 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nCopenhagen and Dubrovnik, Brussels and Copenhagen, Prague and Geneva, Athens and Geneva, Naples and Dubrovnik, Athens and Dubrovnik, Geneva and Mykonos, Naples and Mykonos, Naples and Copenhagen, Munich and Mykonos, Naples and Athens, Prague and Athens, Santorini and Geneva, Athens and Santorini, Naples and Munich, Prague and Copenhagen, Brussels and Naples, Athens and Mykonos, Athens and Copenhagen, Naples and Geneva, Dubrovnik and Munich, Brussels and Munich, Prague and Brussels, Brussels and Athens, Athens and Munich, Geneva and Munich, Copenhagen and Munich, Brussels and Geneva, Copenhagen and Geneva, Prague and Munich, Copenhagen and Santorini, Naples and Santorini, Geneva and Dubrovnik.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 28 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
