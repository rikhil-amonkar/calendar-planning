You plan to stay in Lyon for 7 days. You want to spend 7 days in Bucharest. You are going to attend a wedding in Bucharest between day 1 and day 7. You want to spend 4 days in Porto.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBucharest and Lyon, Lyon and Porto.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The constraints are:\n\n* Each city can only be visited once\n* The wedding in Bucharest can only be attended between day 1 and day 7\n* The city with the most days must come first\n\nThe code uses decision variables to represent whether each city is visited on each day, and then defines constraints to ensure that the solution satisfies the constraints.\n\nThe solution is then printed out, showing which city is visited on each day.\n\nPlease note that this code may take a while to run, as it needs to solve a complex scheduling problem."
