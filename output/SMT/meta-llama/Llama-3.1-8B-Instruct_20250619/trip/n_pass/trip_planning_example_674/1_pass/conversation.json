You want to spend 2 days in Helsinki. You have to attend a workshop in Helsinki between day 1 and day 2. You want to spend 3 days in Warsaw. You plan to visit relatives in Warsaw between day 9 and day 11. You want to spend 4 days in Madrid. You want to spend 4 days in Split. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Reykjavik between day 8 and day 9. You would like to visit Budapest for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nHelsinki and Reykjavik, Budapest and Warsaw, Madrid and Split, Helsinki and Split, Helsinki and Madrid, Helsinki and Budapest, Reykjavik and Warsaw, Helsinki and Warsaw, Madrid and Budapest, Budapest and Reykjavik, Madrid and Warsaw, Warsaw and Split, from Reykjavik to Madrid.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 14 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

Also, the output may not be the most optimal solution, but rather one that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nAlso, note that the Z3 solver may return a model that is not the most optimal solution, but rather one that satisfies all the constraints. The code above uses a brute-force approach to find a solution, which may not be the most efficient way to solve this problem. A more efficient approach might involve using a constraint programming library or a mixed-integer linear programming solver."
