You want to spend 4 days in Vienna. During day 1 and day 4, you have to attend a conference in Vienna. You want to spend 2 days in Milan. You plan to stay in Rome for 3 days. You would like to visit Riga for 2 days. You would like to visit Lisbon for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Lisbon between day 11 and day 13. You want to spend 4 days in Vilnius. You want to spend 3 days in Oslo. You want to meet a friend in Oslo between day 13 and day 15.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nRiga and Oslo, Rome and Oslo, Vienna and Milan, Vienna and Vilnius, Vienna and Lisbon, Riga and Milan, Lisbon and Oslo, from Rome to Riga, Rome and Lisbon, Vienna and Riga, Vienna and Rome, Milan and Oslo, Vienna and Oslo, Vilnius and Oslo, from Riga to Vilnius, Vilnius and Milan, Riga and Lisbon, Milan and Lisbon.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 15 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
