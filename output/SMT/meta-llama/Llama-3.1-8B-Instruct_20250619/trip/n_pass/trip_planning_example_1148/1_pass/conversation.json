You want to spend 2 days in Lisbon. You have to attend a workshop in Lisbon between day 4 and day 5. You want to spend 5 days in Dubrovnik. You want to spend 5 days in Copenhagen. You plan to stay in Prague for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Tallinn. You want to meet a friend in Tallinn between day 1 and day 2. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 4 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Stockholm between day 13 and day 16. You plan to stay in Split for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Lyon. From day 18 to day 19, there is a annual show you want to attend in Lyon.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nDubrovnik and Stockholm, Lisbon and Copenhagen, Lisbon and Lyon, Copenhagen and Stockholm, Copenhagen and Split, Prague and Stockholm, Tallinn and Stockholm, Prague and Lyon, Lisbon and Stockholm, Prague and Lisbon, Stockholm and Split, Prague and Copenhagen, Split and Lyon, Copenhagen and Dubrovnik, Prague and Split, Tallinn and Copenhagen, Tallinn and Prague.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 19 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It first defines the variables and constraints, then adds the constraints to the solver. Finally, it checks the solution and prints the result.\n\nNote that the `s.check()` function returns `sat` if a solution exists, and `unsat` otherwise. If a solution exists, the `s.model()` function returns a model of the solution, which can be used to get the values of the variables. In this case, we use the `as_long()` function to get the value of each variable as an integer."
