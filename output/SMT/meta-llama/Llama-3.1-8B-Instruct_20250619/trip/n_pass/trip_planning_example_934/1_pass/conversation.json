You would like to visit Brussels for 5 days. You have to attend a workshop in Brussels between day 7 and day 11. You would like to visit Rome for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Dubrovnik. You would like to visit Geneva for 5 days. You plan to stay in Budapest for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Budapest between day 16 and day 17. You plan to stay in Riga for 4 days. You would like to meet your friends at Riga between day 4 and day 7 to tour together. You would like to visit Valencia for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBrussels and Valencia, Rome and Valencia, Brussels and Geneva, Rome and Geneva, Dubrovnik and Geneva, Valencia and Geneva, from Rome to Riga, Geneva and Budapest, Riga and Brussels, Rome and Budapest, Rome and Brussels, Brussels and Budapest, Dubrovnik and Rome.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 17 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
