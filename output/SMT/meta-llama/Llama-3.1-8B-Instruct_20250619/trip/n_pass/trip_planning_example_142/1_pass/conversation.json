You have to attend a workshop in Tallinn between day 6 and day 7.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMadrid and Dublin, Dublin and Tallinn.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 7 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

It first defines the cities, days, and direct flights. Then it defines the constraints, including the number of days in each city, the attendance of the workshop in Tallinn, and the constraints on the number of cities that can be visited on each day. Finally, it solves the constraints using the Z3 solver and prints the solution."
