You plan to stay in Paris for 6 days. You want to spend 5 days in Oslo. You plan to visit relatives in Oslo between day 19 and day 23. You want to spend 7 days in Porto. You would like to visit Geneva for 7 days. During day 1 and day 7, you have to attend a conference in Geneva. You want to spend 2 days in Reykjavik.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nParis and Oslo, Geneva and Oslo, Porto and Paris, Geneva and Paris, Geneva and Porto, Paris and Reykjavik, Reykjavik and Oslo, Porto and Oslo.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 23 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
