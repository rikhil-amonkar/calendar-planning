You want to spend 3 days in Mykonos. You would like to visit Reykjavik for 2 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Reykjavik between day 9 and day 10. You want to spend 5 days in Dublin. From day 2 to day 6, there is a annual show you want to attend in Dublin. You plan to stay in London for 5 days. You plan to stay in Helsinki for 4 days. You would like to visit Hamburg for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Hamburg between day 1 and day 2 to tour together.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nDublin and London, Hamburg and Dublin, Helsinki and Reykjavik, Hamburg and London, Dublin and Helsinki, Reykjavik and London, London and Mykonos, Dublin and Reykjavik, Hamburg and Helsinki, Helsinki and London.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines the cities, days, and variables, and then adds constraints based on the problem statement. The constraints include the total number of days spent in each city, the direct flights between cities, the wedding in Reykjavik, the annual show in Dublin, the meeting friends in Hamburg, and the staying in cities for specific days. The program then solves the constraints and prints the solution."
