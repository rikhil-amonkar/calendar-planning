You want to spend 6 days in Seville. You want to spend 2 days in Paris. You plan to stay in Krakow for 5 days. You have to attend a workshop in Krakow between day 1 and day 5.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nKrakow and Paris, Paris and Seville.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 11 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
