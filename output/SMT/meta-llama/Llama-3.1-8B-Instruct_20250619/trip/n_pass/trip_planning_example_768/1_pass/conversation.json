You want to spend 4 days in Mykonos. You would like to visit Nice for 3 days. During day 14 and day 16, you have to attend a conference in Nice. You would like to visit London for 2 days. You plan to stay in Copenhagen for 3 days. You would like to visit Oslo for 5 days. You want to meet a friend in Oslo between day 10 and day 14. You want to spend 4 days in Tallinn.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLondon and Copenhagen, Copenhagen and Tallinn, Tallinn and Oslo, Mykonos and London, Oslo and Nice, London and Nice, Mykonos and Nice, London and Oslo, Copenhagen and Nice, Copenhagen and Oslo.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
