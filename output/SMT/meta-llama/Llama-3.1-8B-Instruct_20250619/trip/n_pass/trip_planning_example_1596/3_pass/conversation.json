solution to the scheduling problem.

Finally, it prints the solution and creates a schedule based on the solution.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the direct flights between cities are available on all days. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code to take into account the availability of flights.\n\nAlso, this code does not handle cases where the solution is not unique or where the solution is not feasible (e.g., where there are not enough days to visit all cities). You may need to add additional code to handle these cases."
