# We have a 17-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Naples: 5 days, and you plan to visit relatives in Naples between Day 1 and Day 5.
#   • Vienna: 7 days.
#   • Vilnius: 7 days.
#
# Without overlaps the total days would be 5 + 7 + 7 = 19 days.
# By overlapping the flight days (each flight day counts as both the last day in the current city 
# and the first day in the next), the trip is planned in 17 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Naples and Vienna,
#   • between Vienna and Vilnius.
#
# Thus, the itinerary order is:
#   Naples -> Vienna -> Vilnius.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Naples to Vienna.
#   d2 = flight day from Vienna to Vilnius.
#
# The segments are modeled as follows:
#
# 1. Naples segment:
#      - Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#      - Duration = d1 days.
#      - Must be 5 days, so: d1 == 5.
#      - Also, visiting relatives in Naples between Day 1 and Day 5 is ensured.
#
# 2. Vienna segment:
#      - Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#      - Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#      - Must be 7 days, so: d2 - d1 + 1 == 7.
#
# 3. Vilnius segment:
#      - Runs from Day d2 to Day 17.
#      - Duration = 17 - d2 + 1 days.
#      - Must be 7 days, so: 17 - d2 + 1 == 7.
#
# Now we model these constraints using the Z3 Solver.

s = Solver()

# Flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Naples to Vienna.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Vienna to Vilnius.

# Constraint for the Naples segment: 5 days.
s.add(d1 == 5)

# Constraint for the Vienna segment: 7 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 7)

# Constraint for the Vilnius segment: 7 days.
s.add(17 - d2 + 1 == 7)

# Enforce ordering and valid day ranges.
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 17)
