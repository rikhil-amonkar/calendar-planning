# We have an 11-day trip visiting 3 European cities.
# The requirements are:
#   • Reykjavik: 4 days.
#   • Stuttgart: 3 days.
#   • Porto: 6 days.
#
# Although the sum of the days is 4 + 3 + 6 = 13 days,
# the overlap due to shared flight days (when you fly, that day counts as both the last day in one city
# and the first day in the next) lets the trip fit within 11 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • from Reykjavik to Stuttgart,
#   • from Stuttgart to Porto.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Reykjavik -> Stuttgart -> Porto
#
# We adopt the convention that when a direct flight is taken on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day at the departing city and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Reykjavik to Stuttgart.
#   d2 = flight day from Stuttgart to Porto.
#
# Then the segments are defined as follows:
#
# 1. Reykjavik segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    Requirement: 4 days in Reykjavik, so d1 must be 4.
#
# 2. Stuttgart segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    Requirement: 3 days in Stuttgart, hence: d2 - d1 + 1 = 3.
#    With d1 = 4, this implies: d2 = 6.
#
# 3. Porto segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 11.
#    Duration = 11 - d2 + 1 days.
#    Requirement: 6 days in Porto, hence: 11 - d2 + 1 = 6.
#    With d2 = 6, we verify: 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.
#
# This itinerary meets all the requirements.

# Define flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Reykjavik to Stuttgart.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Stuttgart to Porto.

s.add(d1 == 4)

# Stuttgart segment: Must be 3 days. The duration is d2 - d1 + 1 = 3.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 3)

# Porto segment: Must be 6 days. The duration is 11 - d2 + 1 = 6.
s.add(11 - d2 + 1 == 6)

s.add(d1 < d2)
