# We have an 11-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Krakow: 3 days, and you have a conference in Krakow on Day 1 and Day 3.
#   • Frankfurt: 6 days.
#   • Venice: 4 days.
#
# The total individual durations add up to 3 + 6 + 4 = 13 days, but by overlapping flight days,
# the trip fits into 11 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Krakow and Frankfurt,
#   • between Frankfurt and Venice.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Krakow -> Frankfurt -> Venice
#
# Using the convention that a direct flight on a day counts as the last day at the departing
# city and the first day at the arriving city, we define:
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Krakow to Frankfurt.
#   d2 = flight day from Frankfurt to Venice.
#
# Then the segments become:
#
# 1. Krakow segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    Since Krakow must be 3 days and you need to attend the conference on Day 1 and Day 3,
#    we set:
#         d1 = 3.
#
# 2. Frankfurt segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    Frankfurt must be 6 days, so:
#         d2 - d1 + 1 = 6.
#    With d1 = 3, this gives d2 = 8.
#
# 3. Venice segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 11.
#    Duration = 11 - d2 + 1 days.
#    Venice must be 4 days, so:
#         11 - d2 + 1 = 4.
#    With d2 = 8, we get 11 - 8 + 1 = 4.
#
# This itinerary meets the requirements:
#   - You are in Krakow (with conference days on Day 1 and Day 3) from Day 1 to Day 3.
#   - You are in Frankfurt from Day 3 to Day 8 for 6 days.
#   - You are in Venice from Day 8 to Day 11 for 4 days.
