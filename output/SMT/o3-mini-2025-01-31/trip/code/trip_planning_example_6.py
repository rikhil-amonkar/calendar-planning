# d2: flight day from Munich to Dubrovnik (overlap day for Munich and Dubrovnik)

# Overall trip: days 1 to 8.
# We follow the itinerary order:
#   Berlin -> Munich -> Dubrovnik 
# with Berlin visited from day 1 to d1 (inclusive),
# Munich visited from day d1 to d2 (inclusive),
# and Dubrovnik visited from day d2 to day 8 (inclusive).

# The number of days spent in each city is computed as:
#   Berlin: d1 days (days 1..d1).
#   Munich: d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#   Dubrovnik: 8 - d2 + 1 days.

# Given planning requirements:
#  - Berlin for 4 days (and attend conference in Berlin on day 1 and day 4).
#  - Munich for 3 days.
#  - Dubrovnik for 3 days.

# Duration constraints:
s.add(d1 == 4)                      # Berlin must be 4 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 3)               # Munich must be 3 days => d2 = d1 + 2.
s.add(8 - d2 + 1 == 3)                # Dubrovnik must be 3 days => 9 - d2 = 3, so d2 = 6.

# This forces:
#   d1 = 4 and d2 = 6.

# Chronological ordering constraints:
s.add(d1 < d2, d1 >= 1, d2 <= 8)

# Conference constraint:
# In Berlin, the conference is on day 1 and day 4.
# Since Berlin is attended from day 1 to day d1 and d1 = 4, days 1 and 4 are naturally covered.
# We add an explicit check that day 1 and day 4 fall in the Berlin leg:
# (This is indeed ensured given the breakdown, since Berlin covers days 1..4).
s.add(True)  # (No extra constraints needed because d1=4 ensures Berlin covers day 4.)
