#  0: Zurich     - 2 days; conference must be attended during day 7 and 8
#                    For a 2‚Äêday visit [S, S+1] to cover both day7 and day8, we need S == 7.
#  1: Bucharest  - 2 days; no extra event.
#  2: Hamburg    - 5 days; no extra event.
#  3: Barcelona  - 4 days; no extra event.
#  4: Reykjavik  - 5 days; visit relatives event between day 9 and day 13.
#                    For visit interval [S, S+4] to intersect [9,13] we require: S <= 13 and S+4 >= 9.
#  5: Stuttgart  - 5 days; no extra event.
#  6: Stockholm  - 2 days; no extra event.
#  7: Tallinn    - 4 days; no extra event.
#  8: Milan      - 5 days; meet friends event between day 3 and day 7.
#                    For visit interval [S, S+4] to intersect [3,7] it suffices to require S <= 7.
#  9: London     - 3 days; annual show from day 1 to day 3.
