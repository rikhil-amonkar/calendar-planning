# We have an 11-day trip visiting 3 European cities.
# The requirements are:
#   • London: 3 days and you must attend a workshop in London between day 1 and day 3.
#   • Milan: 6 days.
#   • Porto: 4 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between London and Milan,
#   • between Milan and Porto.
#
# We assume the itinerary order is:
#   London -> Milan -> Porto.
#
# We use the convention that when taking a direct flight on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day at the departing city and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from London to Milan.
#   d2 = flight day from Milan to Porto.
#
# Then we define the segments as follows:
#
# 1. London: From Day 1 to Day d1, the duration is d1 days.
#    We require 3 days in London, hence:
#       d1 = 3.
#
# 2. Milan: From Day d1 to Day d2, the duration is (d2 - d1 + 1) days.
#    We require 6 days in Milan, so:
#       d2 - d1 + 1 = 6.
#
# 3. Porto: From Day d2 to Day 11, the duration is (11 - d2 + 1) days.
#    We require 4 days in Porto, so:
#       11 - d2 + 1 = 4  => 12 - d2 = 4, hence d2 = 8.
#
# The London workshop requirement is satisfied in the London segment, spanning Day 1 to Day 3.
#
# Final Itinerary:
#   • Stay in London from Day 1 to Day 3 (3 days).
#         -> Attend the workshop in London between Day 1 and Day 3.
#         -> On Day 3, take a direct flight from London to Milan.
#   • Stay in Milan from Day 3 to Day 8 (6 days).
#         -> On Day 8, take a direct flight from Milan to Porto.
#   • Stay in Porto from Day 8 to Day 11 (4 days).
