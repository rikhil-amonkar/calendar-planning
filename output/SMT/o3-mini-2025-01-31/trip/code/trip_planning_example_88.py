# We have a 12-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Lyon: 4 days, and from Day 1 to Day 4 there is an annual show in Lyon.
#   • Amsterdam: 6 days.
#   • Seville: 4 days.
#
# Without overlaps the total would be 4 + 6 + 4 = 14 days.
# With overlapping of flight days (each flight day counts as the last day in the departing city
# and the first day in the arriving city), we can schedule it in 12 days.
#
# Available direct flights:
#   • between Lyon and Amsterdam,
#   • between Amsterdam and Seville.
#
# We choose the itinerary ordering:
#   Lyon -> Amsterdam -> Seville.
#
# Define:
#   d1 = flight day from Lyon to Amsterdam.
#   d2 = flight day from Amsterdam to Seville.
#
# Then the segments are:
#
# 1. Lyon segment:
#    - Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    - Duration = d1 days.
#    - Must be 4 days and cover the annual show (Days 1 to 4): d1 = 4.
#
# 2. Amsterdam segment:
#    - Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    - Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 6 days: d2 - d1 + 1 = 6  -> with d1 = 4, d2 = 9.
#
# 3. Seville segment:
#    - Runs from Day d2 to Day 12.
#    - Duration = 12 - d2 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 4 days: 12 - d2 + 1 = 4  -> with d2 = 9, this holds: 13 - 9 = 4.
#
# We now model these constraints with the Z3 solver.

s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Lyon to Amsterdam.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Amsterdam to Seville.

# Constraint for Lyon segment (4 days, ensuring the show is attended on Day1 to Day4):
s.add(d1 == 4)

# Constraint for Amsterdam segment (6 days):
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 6)

# Constraint for Seville segment (4 days):
s.add(12 - d2 + 1 == 4)

# Enforce ordering and valid day ranges.
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 12)
