# We have a 9-day trip visiting 3 European cities.
# The requirements are:
#   • Copenhagen: 2 days.
#   • Geneva: 6 days.
#   • Mykonos: 3 days.
#
# Additionally, you would like to meet your friends at Mykonos between day 7 and day 9.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Copenhagen and Geneva,
#   • between Geneva and Mykonos.
#
# Because the flight routes form the connection:
#   Copenhagen <--> Geneva <--> Mykonos,
# a natural itinerary order is:
#   Copenhagen -> Geneva -> Mykonos.
#
# We use the convention that when you take a direct flight on a day,
# that day is counted as the last day in the departing city and the first day in the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = the flight day from Copenhagen to Geneva.
#   d2 = the flight day from Geneva to Mykonos.
#
# Then the segments are:
#
# 1. Copenhagen segment:
#    From Day 1 to Day d1, duration = d1 days.
#    We require 2 days in Copenhagen, so:
#         d1 = 2.
#
# 2. Geneva segment:
#    From Day d1 to Day d2, duration = (d2 - d1 + 1) days.
#    We require 6 days in Geneva, so:
#         d2 - d1 + 1 = 6.
#
# 3. Mykonos segment:
#    From Day d2 to Day 9, duration = (9 - d2 + 1) days.
#    We require 3 days in Mykonos, so:
#         9 - d2 + 1 = 3.
#
# Let's check the Mykonos equation:
#    9 - d2 + 1 = 3   ->  10 - d2 = 3   ->  d2 = 7.
#
# And then the Geneva equation becomes:
#    d2 - 2 + 1 = 6   ->  (7 - 2 + 1 = 6)  -> 6 = 6.
#
# This itinerary also meets the friends meeting requirement in Mykonos,
# as the Mykonos segment spans days 7 to 9.
#
# Final Itinerary:
#   • Stay in Copenhagen from Day 1 to Day 2 (2 days).
#         -> On Day 2, take a direct flight from Copenhagen to Geneva.
#   • Stay in Geneva from Day 2 to Day 7 (6 days).
#         -> On Day 7, take a direct flight from Geneva to Mykonos.
#   • Stay in Mykonos from Day 7 to Day 9 (3 days).
#         -> Meet your friends in Mykonos between Day 7 and Day 9.
