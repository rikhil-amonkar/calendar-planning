# We plan a 13‑day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Stockholm: 6 days and you must attend a conference on Day 1 and Day 6.
#   • Athens:    5 days.
#   • Mykonos:   4 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Stockholm and Athens,
#   • between Athens and Mykonos.
#
# We assume the itinerary is:
#   Stockholm -> Athens -> Mykonos.
#
# Using the usual convention that when you take a flight on a day, that day counts as both 
# the last day in the departure city and the first day in the arrival city, we define:
#
# Let:
#   d1 = the flight day from Stockholm to Athens.
#   d2 = the flight day from Athens to Mykonos.
#
# Then the segments are:
#   - Stockholm: Days 1 to d1,           duration = d1 days (must equal 6, to cover the conference on day 1 and 6).
#   - Athens:    Days d1 to d2,           duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days (must equal 5).
#   - Mykonos:   Days d2 to Day 13,       duration = 13 - d2 + 1 = 14 - d2 days (must equal 4).
#
# This produces the following constraints:
#   1. d1 == 6.
#   2. d2 - d1 + 1 == 5   --> d2 - 6 + 1 == 5  --> d2 - 5 == 5  --> d2 == 10.
#   3. 14 - d2 == 4  --> d2 == 10.
#
# These values satisfy the itinerary:
#   • Stockholm: Days 1 to 6 (6 days, with conference on Days 1 and 6).
#   • Athens: Days 6 to 10 (5 days).
#   • Mykonos: Days 10 to 13 (4 days).
#
# Now we encode and solve these constraints with Z3.

# Define flight day variables.
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Stockholm to Athens.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Athens to Mykonos.

# Add constraints for each segment.

s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 5)         # Athens is visited for exactly 5 days.
s.add(14 - d2 == 4)             # Mykonos is visited for exactly 4 days.

# Ensure the flight days are in order and within the 13-day period.
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 13)
