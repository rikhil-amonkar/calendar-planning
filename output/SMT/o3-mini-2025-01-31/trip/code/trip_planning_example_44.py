# We plan a 17-day trip visiting 3 cities with these requirements:
#   • Zurich: 7 days, and you must attend a wedding in Zurich between Day 1 and Day 7.
#   • Rome:   6 days.
#   • Lyon:   6 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Zurich and Rome,
#   • between Rome and Lyon.
#
# Since there is no direct flight connecting Zurich and Lyon, we must use Rome as the connecting hub.
#
# We choose the itinerary:
#   Zurich -> Rome -> Lyon.
#
# We adopt the convention that when you take a flight on a day, that day counts as both the last day in
# the departure city and the first day in the arrival city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = the flight day from Zurich to Rome.
#   d2 = the flight day from Rome to Lyon.
#
# Then the segments of the trip are:
#
#   1. Zurich:   Days 1 to d1.
#      Duration = d1 days, and we need this to equal 7 days
#      --> d1 = 7.
#
#   2. Rome:     Days d1 to d2.
#      Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days, which must equal 6 days.
#      --> d2 - 7 + 1 = 6  --> d2 = 12.
#
#   3. Lyon:     Days d2 to Day 17.
#      Duration = 17 - d2 + 1 = 18 - d2 days, which must equal 6 days.
#      --> 18 - d2 = 6  --> d2 = 12.
#
# With these, the plan is:
#   - Stay in Zurich from Day 1 to Day 7: 7 days (wedding attended between Day 1 and Day 7).
#   - On Day 7, take a direct flight from Zurich to Rome.
#   - Stay in Rome from Day 7 to Day 12: 6 days.
#   - On Day 12, take a direct flight from Rome to Lyon.
#   - Stay in Lyon from Day 12 to Day 17: 6 days.
#
# We now encode these constraints using Z3:

s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables.
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Zurich to Rome.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Rome to Lyon.

# Add constraints for the trip segments.
s.add(d1 == 7)                # Zurich is visited for exactly 7 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 6)         # Rome is visited for exactly 6 days.
s.add(18 - d2 == 6)             # Lyon is visited for exactly 6 days.

# Ensure that flight days are in order and fall within the 17-day trip.
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 17)

if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    d1_val = m[d1].as_long()  # Expected: 7
    d2_val = m[d2].as_long()  # Expected: 12
