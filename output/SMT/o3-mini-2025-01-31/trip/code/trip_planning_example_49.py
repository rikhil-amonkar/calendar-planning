# We have a 13-day trip visiting 3 European cities.
# The requirements are:
#   • Split: 3 days, and you plan to visit relatives in Split between Day 1 and Day 3.
#   • Milan: 7 days.
#   • Reykjavik: 5 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Split and Milan,
#   • between Milan and Reykjavik.
#
# To satisfy the relative visit requirement in Split (between Day 1 and Day 3),
# the Split segment must occur at the very start of the trip.
#
# We assume the itinerary order to be:
#   Split -> Milan -> Reykjavik.
#
# We adopt the convention that when you take a direct flight on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day at the departing city and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = the flight day from Split to Milan.
#   d2 = the flight day from Milan to Reykjavik.
#
# Then the segments are defined as follows:
#
# 1. Split: from Day 1 to Day d1, with duration = d1 days.
#    We need a 3-day stay in Split, so: d1 = 3.
#
# 2. Milan: from Day d1 to Day d2, with duration = d2 - d1 + 1.
#    We need a 7-day stay in Milan, so: d2 - d1 + 1 = 7.
#      Given d1 = 3, we get: d2 - 3 + 1 = 7, hence d2 = 9.
#
# 3. Reykjavik: from Day d2 to Day 13, with duration = 13 - d2 + 1.
#    We need a 5-day stay in Reykjavik, so: 13 - d2 + 1 = 5,
#      which simplifies to: 14 - d2 = 5, hence d2 = 9.
#
# The relative meeting requirement in Split is automatically satisfied since
# the Split segment covers Days 1 up to Day 3.
#
# Itinerary summary:
#   • Stay in Split from Day 1 to Day 3 (3 days); relatives can be visited between Day 1 and Day 3.
#       (On Day 3, take a direct flight from Split to Milan.)
#   • Stay in Milan from Day 3 to Day 9 (7 days).
#       (On Day 9, take a direct flight from Milan to Reykjavik.)
#   • Stay in Reykjavik from Day 9 to Day 13 (5 days).
