# We have a 12-day trip with 3 cities and available direct flights:
#   • Venice and Zurich have a direct flight.
#   • There is a flight from Zurich to Florence.
#
# Itinerary requirements:
#   - Visit Venice for 6 days.
#   - Stay in Zurich for 2 days.
#   - Visit Florence for 6 days.
#
# The itinerary is modeled with two flight legs:
#   d1: the day on which you take the flight from Venice to Zurich.
#       You are in Venice from Day 1 through Day d1 (inclusive).
#
#   d2: the day on which you take the flight from Zurich to Florence.
#       You are in Zurich from Day d1 through Day d2 (inclusive),
#       and you are in Florence from Day d2 to Day 12 (inclusive).
#
# Note: The day of each flight counts as a day spent in both the departing city and the arriving city.
#
# Therefore the durations are determined as follows:
#
#   Venice duration = d1, and we require this to equal 6 days.
#       => d1 = 6.
#
#   Zurich duration = d2 - d1 + 1, and we require this to equal 2 days.
#       => d2 - 6 + 1 = 2   =>  d2 - 5 = 2   =>  d2 = 7.
#
#   Florence duration = 12 - d2 + 1 = 13 - d2, and we require this to equal 6 days.
#       => 13 - d2 = 6   =>  d2 = 7.
#
# These constraints yield d1 = 6 and d2 = 7.
# This itinerary corresponds to:
#   - Venice: Day 1 to Day 6 (6 days),
#   - Zurich: Day 6 to Day 7 (2 days),
#   - Florence: Day 7 to Day 12 (6 days).
#
# Now we encode these constraints using Z3:

s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Venice to Zurich.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Zurich to Florence.

# Add constraints for durations:
s.add(d1 == 6)             # Venice: 6 days from Day 1 to Day 6.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 2)      # Zurich: 2 days from Day d1 to Day d2.
s.add(13 - d2 == 6)          # Florence: 6 days from Day d2 to Day 12.

# Enforce flight ordering and bounds within the 12-day trip:
s.add(d1 < d2)             # You must fly from Venice to Zurich before the next flight.
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 12)     # Flight days must lie within Day 1 and Day 12.

if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    d1_val = m[d1].as_long()  # Expected to be 6.
    d2_val = m[d2].as_long()  # Expected to be 7.
