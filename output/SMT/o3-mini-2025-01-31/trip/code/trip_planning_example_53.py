# We have a 12-day trip visiting 3 European cities.
# The requirements are:
#   • Oslo: 3 days, with a visit to relatives between Day 1 and Day 3.
#   • Vienna: 5 days.
#   • Stuttgart: 6 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Oslo and Vienna,
#   • between Vienna and Stuttgart.
#
# Since you need to visit relatives in Oslo early (between Day 1 and Day 3),
# we structure the itinerary so that Oslo comes first.
#
# We assume the following itinerary order:
#   Oslo -> Vienna -> Stuttgart.
#
# We use the convention that when you take a direct flight on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day at the departing city and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Oslo to Vienna.
#   d2 = flight day from Vienna to Stuttgart.
#
# Then the segments (with overlapping flight days) are defined as:
#
# 1. Oslo: from Day 1 to Day d1, duration = d1 days.
#    We require 3 days in Oslo (with relatives visit between Day 1 and Day 3),
#    so we set: d1 = 3.
#
# 2. Vienna: from Day d1 to Day d2, duration = (d2 - d1 + 1) days.
#    We require 5 days in Vienna, so: d2 - d1 + 1 = 5.
#    With d1 = 3, this gives: d2 - 3 + 1 = 5  -->  d2 = 7.
#
# 3. Stuttgart: from Day d2 to Day 12, duration = (12 - d2 + 1) days.
#    We require 6 days in Stuttgart, so: 12 - d2 + 1 = 6.
#    With d2 = 7, we have: 12 - 7 + 1 = 6, which holds.
#
# This itinerary satisfies all requirements including that
# the relatives visit in Oslo happens during the Oslo stay (Days 1 through 3).
#
# Final Itinerary:
#   • Oslo from Day 1 to Day 3 (3 days). (Relatives can be visited between Day 1 and Day 3.)
#       -> On Day 3, take a direct flight from Oslo to Vienna.
#   • Vienna from Day 3 to Day 7 (5 days).
#       -> On Day 7, take a direct flight from Vienna to Stuttgart.
#   • Stuttgart from Day 7 to Day 12 (6 days).
