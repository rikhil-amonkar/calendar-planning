# We have a 9-day trip with 3 cities and specific visit durations and constraints:
#   • Valencia: 2 days and visiting relatives between Day 1 and Day 2.
#   • Frankfurt: 5 days.
#   • Florence: 4 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • Between Valencia and Frankfurt.
#   • Between Frankfurt and Florence.
#
# Note: The flight day (the day the flight is taken) counts as a day for both the departure and arrival cities.
#
# One valid itinerary that uses these direct flights is:
#   Valencia -> Frankfurt -> Florence.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Valencia to Frankfurt.
#   d2 = flight day from Frankfurt to Florence.
#
# Then the stay durations are modeled as:
#
#   Valencia:  From day 1 to day d1, total duration = d1 days.
#            => We require d1 == 2 (to get 2 days in Valencia).
#
#   Frankfurt: From day d1 to day d2, total duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#            => We require d2 - d1 + 1 == 5.
#
#   Florence: From day d2 to day 9, total duration = 9 - d2 + 1 = 10 - d2 days.
#            => We require 10 - d2 == 4.
#
# Let's encode these constraints using Z3:
s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables.
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Valencia to Frankfurt.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Frankfurt to Florence.

# Set the constraints for the durations.
s.add(d1 == 2)              # Valencia must be visited for exactly 2 days (Day 1 to Day 2).
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 5)       # Frankfurt must be visited for exactly 5 days.
s.add(10 - d2 == 4)           # Florence must be visited for exactly 4 days.

# Enforce flight order, and that flight days are within the total days.
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 9)

# The relative visiting constraint in Valencia (between Day 1 and Day 2) is met because
# the stay in Valencia is exactly Day 1 and Day 2.
# (Additional explicit constraint could be added: d1 <= 2, but d1==2 already ensures that.)

if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    d1_val = m[d1].as_long()  # Expected: 2
    d2_val = m[d2].as_long()  # Expected: 6
