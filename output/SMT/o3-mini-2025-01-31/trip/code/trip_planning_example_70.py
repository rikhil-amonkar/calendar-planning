# We have a 17-day trip visiting 3 European cities with the following requirements:
#   • Lyon: 6 days, and you must visit your relatives there between Day 1 and Day 6.
#   • Amsterdam: 6 days.
#   • Dubrovnik: 7 days.
#
# Although the sum of days if added separately is 6 + 6 + 7 = 19 days,
# overlapping flight days allow the trip to fit into 17 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Lyon and Amsterdam,
#   • between Amsterdam and Dubrovnik.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Lyon -> Amsterdam -> Dubrovnik
#
# We adopt the convention that when a direct flight is taken on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day in one city and the first day in the next.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Lyon to Amsterdam.
#   d2 = flight day from Amsterdam to Dubrovnik.
#
# Then the segments are defined as follows:
#
# 1. Lyon segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    Required: 6 days in Lyon, so we set d1 = 6.
#    The relatives visit in Lyon between Day 1 and Day 6 is thereby satisfied.
#
# 2. Amsterdam segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    Required: 6 days in Amsterdam, so: d2 - d1 + 1 = 6.
#    With d1 = 6, this implies: d2 = 11.
#
# 3. Dubrovnik segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 17.
#    Duration = 17 - d2 + 1 days.
#    Required: 7 days in Dubrovnik, so: 17 - d2 + 1 = 7.
#    With d2 = 11, we have: 17 - 11 + 1 = 7.
#
# This itinerary satisfies all the constraints.
