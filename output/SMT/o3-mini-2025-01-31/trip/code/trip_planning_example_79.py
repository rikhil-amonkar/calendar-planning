# We have an 12-day trip visiting 3 European cities with the following requirements:
#   • Valencia: 6 days.
#   • Dublin: 4 days.
#   • Split: 4 days, with a requirement that you visit your relatives in Split between Day 9 and Day 12.
#
# Note that the sum of individual durations is 6 + 4 + 4 = 14 days, but by overlapping the flight days
# (each flight day counts as both the last day of one city and the first day at the next), we can fit the trip into 12 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Valencia and Dublin,
#   • between Dublin and Split.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Valencia -> Dublin -> Split
#
# Using the convention that a direct flight taken on a day counts as the last day in the departing city and the first day in the arriving city:
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Valencia to Dublin.
#   d2 = flight day from Dublin to Split.
#
# Then, the segments are:
#
# 1. Valencia segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    Requirement: 6 days in Valencia, so we set:
#         d1 = 6.
#
# 2. Dublin segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    Requirement: 4 days in Dublin, so:
#         d2 - d1 + 1 = 4, which implies d2 = d1 + 3.
#    With d1 = 6, this gives d2 = 9.
#
# 3. Split segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 12.
#    Duration = 12 - d2 + 1 days.
#    Requirement: 4 days in Split, so:
#         12 - d2 + 1 = 4.
#    With d2 = 9, we confirm: 12 - 9 + 1 = 4.
#
# The Split segment runs from Day 9 to Day 12, which meets the relative visit requirement.
#
# Setting up the Z3 solver with these constraints:

s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Valencia to Dublin.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Dublin to Split.

# Valencia segment (6 days):
s.add(d1 == 6)

# Dublin segment (4 days):
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 4)

# Split segment (4 days):
s.add(12 - d2 + 1 == 4)

# Enforce ordering and bounds:
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 12)

if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    d1_val = m[d1].as_long()  # Expected: 6 (Flight from Valencia to Dublin).
    d2_val = m[d2].as_long()  # Expected: 9 (Flight from Dublin to Split).
    
    print("Trip plan found:\n")
    
    # Valencia segment.
    print("1. Stay in Valencia from Day 1 to Day {} (6 days).".format(d1_val))
    print("   -> On Day {}, take a direct flight from Valencia to Dublin.".format(d1_val))
    
    # Dublin segment.
    print("2. Stay in Dublin from Day {} to Day {} (4 days).".format(d1_val, d2_val))
    print("   -> On Day {}, take a direct flight from Dublin to Split.".format(d2_val))
    
    # Split segment.
    print("3. Stay in Split from Day {} to Day 12 (4 days).".format(d2_val))
    print("   -> Visit your relatives in Split between Day 9 and Day 12.")
