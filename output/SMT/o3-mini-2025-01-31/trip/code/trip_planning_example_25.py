# We have a 16-day trip with 3 cities connected by direct flights:
#   • Valencia and Lyon have a direct flight.
#   • Lyon and Split have a direct flight.
#
# City visit requirements:
#   - Valencia: 5 days.
#   - Lyon: 6 days.
#   - Split: 7 days.
#
# Additionally, there is an annual show in Split that runs from day 10 to day 16, 
# so you need to be in Split by day 10.
#
# We model the itinerary with two flight days:
#   d1: the day on which you fly from Valencia to Lyon.
#       => You are in Valencia from Day 1 to Day d1.
#
#   d2: the day on which you fly from Lyon to Split.
#       => You are in Lyon from Day d1 to Day d2.
#       => You are in Split from Day d2 to Day 16.
#
# Note: The flight day counts for both the city you’re leaving and the city you’re entering.
#
# Hence, the durations are:
#   Valencia: d1 days (must equal 5)      ---> d1 = 5.
#   Lyon: d2 - d1 + 1 days (must equal 6)   ---> d2 - d1 + 1 = 6.
#   Split: 16 - d2 + 1 days (must equal 7)   ---> 17 - d2 = 7  -> d2 = 10.
#
# The additional requirement for Split is that you must be there for the annual show starting on day 10.
# Since d2 = 10, you are in Split from day 10 to day 16.
#
# Now we encode these constraints using Z3:

s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Valencia to Lyon.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Lyon to Split.

# Add constraints for the durations:
s.add(d1 == 5)           # Valencia for 5 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 6)    # Lyon for 6 days.
s.add(17 - d2 == 7)        # Split for 7 days.

# Enforce flight ordering and bounds within the 16-day trip:
s.add(d1 < d2)          # Must fly to Lyon before flying to Split.
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 16)  # Flight days must occur within the trip duration.

# Ensure Split is reached by day 10 to attend the annual show:
s.add(d2 <= 10)

if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    d1_val = m[d1].as_long()  # Should be 5
    d2_val = m[d2].as_long()  # Should be 10

    print("Trip plan found:\n")
    print("1. Stay in Valencia from Day 1 to Day {} (5 days).".format(d1_val))
    print("   -> On Day {}, take a direct flight from Valencia to Lyon.".format(d1_val))
    print("2. Stay in Lyon from Day {} to Day {} (6 days).".format(d1_val, d2_val))
    print("   -> On Day {}, take a direct flight from Lyon to Split.".format(d2_val))
    print("3. Stay in Split from Day {} to Day 16 (7 days).".format(d2_val))
    print("   -> Attend the annual show in Split from Day 10 to Day 16.")
