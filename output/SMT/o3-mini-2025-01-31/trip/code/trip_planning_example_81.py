# We have a 9-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Mykonos: 6 days, and you must attend a conference in Mykonos on Day 4 and Day 9.
#   • Budapest: 3 days.
#   • Hamburg: 2 days.
#
# The total individual durations add up to 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 days,
# but overlapping the flight days (each flight day counts as the last day in the departing city 
# and the first day in the next) reduces the total to 9 days.
#
# Available direct flights:
#   • between Hamburg and Budapest,
#   • between Budapest and Mykonos.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Hamburg -> Budapest -> Mykonos
#
# We adopt the convention that a direct flight on a day counts as both the last day at the
# departing city and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Hamburg to Budapest.
#   d2 = flight day from Budapest to Mykonos.
#
# Then the segments become:
#
# 1. Hamburg segment:
#    - Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    - Duration = d1 days.
#    - Must be 2 days, so: d1 = 2.
#
# 2. Budapest segment:
#    - Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    - Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 3 days, so: d2 - d1 + 1 = 3  -->  d2 = d1 + 2.
#      With d1 = 2, we get d2 = 4.
#
# 3. Mykonos segment:
#    - Runs from Day d2 to Day 9.
#    - Duration = 9 - d2 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 6 days, so: 9 - d2 + 1 = 6.
#      With d2 = 4, we have 9 - 4 + 1 = 6.
#
# This itinerary ensures that:
#   - You are in Hamburg from Day 1 to Day 2 (2 days), then fly to Budapest on Day 2.
#   - You are in Budapest from Day 2 to Day 4 (3 days), then fly to Mykonos on Day 4.
#   - You are in Mykonos from Day 4 to Day 9 (6 days), attending the conference on Day 4 (arrival day) and Day 9.
