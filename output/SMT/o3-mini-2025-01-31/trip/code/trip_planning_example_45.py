# We plan a 16‑day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Copenhagen: 7 days, and you must attend a conference in Copenhagen on Day 1 and Day 7.
#   • Lisbon:     7 days.
#   • Florence:   4 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Copenhagen and Lisbon,
#   • between Lisbon and Florence.
#
# Since there is no direct flight linking Copenhagen and Florence,
# we use Lisbon as the connecting hub.
#
# We adopt the convention that when you take a flight on a day, that day counts as both
# the last day in the departing city and the first day in the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = the flight day from Copenhagen to Lisbon.
#   d2 = the flight day from Lisbon to Florence.
#
# Then the trip segments are:
#   1. Copenhagen: Days 1 to d1, duration = d1 days. This must equal 7 days.
#      --> d1 = 7.
#
#   2. Lisbon: Days d1 to d2, duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days. This must equal 7 days.
#      --> d2 - 7 + 1 = 7  --> d2 = 13.
#
#   3. Florence: Days d2 to Day 16, duration = 16 - d2 + 1 = 17 - d2 days. This must equal 4 days.
#      --> 17 - d2 = 4  --> d2 = 13.
#
# With these flight days:
#   • You spend Days 1 to 7 in Copenhagen (meeting the conference requirements on Day 1 and Day 7).
#   • On Day 7, you take a direct flight from Copenhagen to Lisbon.
#   • You spend Days 7 to 13 in Lisbon.
#   • On Day 13, you take a direct flight from Lisbon to Florence.
#   • You spend Days 13 to 16 in Florence.
#
# Now we encode these constraints with Z3.

# Define flight day variables.
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Copenhagen to Lisbon.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Lisbon to Florence.

# Add constraints based on the segments:
s.add(d1 == 7)                  # Copenhagen for 7 days: Day 1 to Day 7.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 7)           # Lisbon for 7 days.
s.add(17 - d2 == 4)               # Florence for 4 days.

# Enforce flight order and ensure flight days do not exceed the 16-day trip.
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 16)
