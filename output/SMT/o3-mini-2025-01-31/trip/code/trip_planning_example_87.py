# We have a 7-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Riga: 2 days, and you plan to visit relatives in Riga between Day 1 and Day 2.
#   • Amsterdam: 2 days.
#   • Mykonos: 5 days.
#
# Without overlapping, the total is 2 + 2 + 5 = 9 days.
# With overlapping flight days (where a flight day counts as the last day in the current city
# and the first day in the next), we can fit the trip into 7 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Riga and Amsterdam,
#   • between Amsterdam and Mykonos.
#
# Therefore, the itinerary ordering is: Riga -> Amsterdam -> Mykonos.
#
# Define:
#   d1 = flight day from Riga to Amsterdam.
#   d2 = flight day from Amsterdam to Mykonos.
#
# Then:
#
# 1. Riga segment:
#    - Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    - Duration: d1 days.
#    - Must last for 2 days (to fulfill the requirement in Riga and for visiting relatives),
#      so we set: d1 == 2.
#
# 2. Amsterdam segment:
#    - Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    - Duration: d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    - Must last for 2 days, so: d2 - d1 + 1 == 2.
#      With d1 == 2, this implies d2 == 3.
#
# 3. Mykonos segment:
#    - Runs from Day d2 to Day 7.
#    - Duration: 7 - d2 + 1 days.
#    - Must last for 5 days, so: 7 - d2 + 1 == 5.
#      With d2 == 3, we have 7 - 3 + 1 = 5.
#
# Additionally, the relatives in Riga should be visited between Day 1 and Day 2.
# This is naturally satisfied since the Riga segment covers Days 1 and 2.
#
# We now model these constraints with Z3.
