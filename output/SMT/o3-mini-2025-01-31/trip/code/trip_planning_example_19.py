# In this problem, we have 3 cities and direct flights:
#   • Brussels and Valencia
#   • Nice and Brussels
#
# This forces a valid itinerary order.
#
# To have a valid trip using the available flights, we choose the itinerary:
#   Valencia -> Brussels -> Nice
#
# Explanation:
# - A direct flight exists between Valencia and Brussels.
# - A direct flight exists between Brussels and Nice.
#
# We define two flight days:
#   d1: the day (within the 9-day trip) when you fly from Valencia to Brussels.
#       Thus, Valencia is visited from Day 1 to Day d1.
#
#   d2: the day when you fly from Brussels to Nice.
#       Thus, Brussels is visited from Day d1 to Day d2, and Nice from Day d2 to Day 9.
#
# Note: The travel day (flight day) counts as a day in both cities.
#
# The duration requirements are:
# 1. Valencia for 3 days:
#      => Duration for Valencia = d1, so require: d1 == 3.
#
# 2. Brussels for 2 days:
#      => Duration for Brussels = (d2 - d1 + 1).
#         So we require: d2 - d1 + 1 == 2.
#
# 3. Nice for 6 days:
#      => Duration for Nice = (9 - d2 + 1) = 10 - d2.
#         So we require: 10 - d2 == 6.
#
# 4. You would like to meet your friends at Nice between day 1 and day 6.
#      => Because Nice is visited from day d2 to day 9,
#         we add the condition that Nice starts early enough (d2 <= 6).
#
# Solving the equations:
#   From (1):      d1 = 3.
#   From (3):      10 - d2 == 6  -> d2 = 4.
#   Check (2):     d2 - 3 + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2, which is correct.
#   And (4) gives: d2 (which is 4) is indeed <= 6.
#
# Thus the itinerary is:
#   Valencia: Day 1 to Day 3 (3 days)
#   Brussels: Day 3 to Day 4 (2 days)
#   Nice:     Day 4 to Day 9 (6 days)
#
# Let's encode and solve this using Z3.

s = Solver()

# Define the flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight from Valencia to Brussels.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight from Brussels to Nice.

# Add constraints for the durations:
s.add(d1 == 3)                     # Valencia for 3 days: visited from Day 1 to Day 3.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 2)              # Brussels for 2 days.
s.add(10 - d2 == 6)                  # Nice for 6 days.
s.add(d2 <= 6)                     # Nice starts before or at Day 6, so you can meet your friends.

# Enforce flight order and bounds:
s.add(d1 < d2)                     # Must fly from Valencia to Brussels before Brussels to Nice.
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 9)              # Flight days must be within the 9-day trip.
