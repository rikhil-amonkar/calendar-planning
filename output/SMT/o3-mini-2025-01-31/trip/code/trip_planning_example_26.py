# We have a 16-day trip with 3 cities:
#   - Porto, Berlin, and Reykjavik.
#
# Available direct flights:
#   • Porto and Berlin
#   • Berlin and Reykjavik
#
# Requirements:
#   - Porto for 7 days.
#   - Berlin for 6 days.
#   - Reykjavik for 5 days.
#
# Additional constraint:
#   - You want to meet a friend in Reykjavik between day 12 and day 16.
#     This means that when you are in Reykjavik, the period must include at least one day
#     between day 12 and day 16.
#
# We can model the itinerary by defining:
#   d1: the flight day from Porto to Berlin.
#       You are in Porto from Day 1 to Day d1 (counting d1).
#
#   d2: the flight day from Berlin to Reykjavik.
#       You are in Berlin from Day d1 to Day d2 (counting d2).
#       You are in Reykjavik from Day d2 to Day 16.
#
# Note: The flight day is counted in both the city you are leaving and the destination city.
#
# Durations:
#   - Porto duration = d1 must equal 7.
#   - Berlin duration = d2 - d1 + 1 must equal 6.
#   - Reykjavik duration = 16 - d2 + 1 = 17 - d2 must equal 5.
#
# Solving:
#   From Porto: d1 = 7.
#   From Berlin: d2 - 7 + 1 = 6  =>  d2 - 6 = 6  =>  d2 = 12.
#   From Reykjavik: 17 - d2 = 5  =>  d2 = 12.
#
# With d2 = 12, you are in Reykjavik from day 12 to day 16, which meets the friend meeting requirement.
#
# Now we encode the constraints using Z3:

s = Solver()

# Define the flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Porto to Berlin.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Berlin to Reykjavik.

# Add constraints for the durations:
s.add(d1 == 7)              # Porto: days 1 to 7.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 6)       # Berlin: 6 days.
s.add(17 - d2 == 5)           # Reykjavik: 5 days.

# Enforce proper flight order and bounds:
s.add(d1 < d2)              # You must leave Porto before leaving Berlin.
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 16)      # Flight days lie within the 16-day trip.

# Ensure that Reykjavik visit covers meeting the friend between day 12 and day 16.
# Since you're in Reykjavik from day d2 to day 16, we need d2 <= 12 
# (so that day 12 is included in your stay).
s.add(d2 <= 12)

if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    d1_val = m[d1].as_long()  # Expected to be 7.
    d2_val = m[d2].as_long()  # Expected to be 12.
