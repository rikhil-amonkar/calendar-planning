# We have a 10-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Seville: 6 days.
#   • Dublin: 4 days.
#   • Dubrovnik: 2 days, and you are attending a wedding in Dubrovnik between Day 9 and Day 10.
#
# Without overlapping, the total days would be 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 days.
# By overlapping the flight days (each flight day counts as the last day in one city
# and the first day in the next), we can schedule the trip in 10 days.
#
# Available direct flights:
#   • between Seville and Dublin,
#   • between Dublin and Dubrovnik.
#
# This sets the itinerary order as:
#   Seville -> Dublin -> Dubrovnik.
#
# We introduce variables:
#   d1 = flight day from Seville to Dublin.
#   d2 = flight day from Dublin to Dubrovnik.
#
# Then we define the segments as follows:
#
# 1. Seville segment:
#    - Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    - Duration = d1 days.
#    - Must be 6 days, so: d1 == 6.
#
# 2. Dublin segment:
#    - Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    - Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 4 days, so: d2 - d1 + 1 == 4.
#
# 3. Dubrovnik segment:
#    - Runs from Day d2 to Day 10.
#    - Duration = 10 - d2 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 2 days, so: 10 - d2 + 1 == 2  -> 11 - d2 == 2  -> d2 = 9.
#
# Also note: The wedding in Dubrovnik is between Day 9 and Day 10; our Dubrovnik segment covers that period.
#
# Now, we model these constraints using the Z3 solver.

s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Seville to Dublin.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Dublin to Dubrovnik.

# Constraints for Seville: 6 days.
s.add(d1 == 6)

# Constraints for Dublin: 4 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 4)

# Constraints for Dubrovnik: 2 days.
s.add(10 - d2 + 1 == 2)  # This simplifies to: d2 = 9

# Enforce ordering and valid day boundaries.
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 10)

if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    d1_val = m[d1].as_long()  # Expected d1 = 6 (flight from Seville to Dublin on Day 6)
    d2_val = m[d2].as_long()  # Expected d2 = 9 (flight from Dublin to Dubrovnik on Day 9)
