# We have a 10-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Split: 2 days, and you want to meet your friends there between Day 1 and Day 2.
#   • Paris: 3 days.
#   • Florence: 7 days.
#
# The sum of individual durations is 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 days.
# With overlapping flight days (a flight day counts as both the last day at the departing city and 
# the first day at the arriving city), we can fit the trip into 10 days.
#
# Available direct flights:
#   • Between Split and Paris,
#   • Between Paris and Florence.
#
# We'll use the itinerary ordering:
#   Split -> Paris -> Florence
#
# We introduce:
#   d1 = flight day from Split to Paris.
#   d2 = flight day from Paris to Florence.
#
# Then the segments are:
#
# 1. Split segment:
#    - Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    - Duration: d1 days.
#    - Must be 2 days, so we set: d1 == 2.
#
# 2. Paris segment:
#    - Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    - Duration: d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 3 days, so: d2 - d1 + 1 == 3.
#      With d1 == 2, this yields: d2 = 4.
#
# 3. Florence segment:
#    - Runs from Day d2 to Day 10.
#    - Duration: 10 - d2 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 7 days, so: 10 - d2 + 1 == 7.
#      With d2 = 4, we have: 10 - 4 + 1 = 7.
#
# In addition, you want to meet your friends in Split between Day 1 and Day 2.
# We will choose a meeting day in Split that falls in [1, d1] (with d1==2).
#
# Now, we model these constraints using the Z3 solver.

# Constraint for Paris segment: 3 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 3)

# Constraint for Florence segment: 7 days.
s.add(10 - d2 + 1 == 7)
