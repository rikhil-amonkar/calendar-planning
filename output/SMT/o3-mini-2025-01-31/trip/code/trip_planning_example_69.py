# We have a 15-day trip visiting 3 European cities with the following requirements:
#   • Vilnius: 5 days, and you have a workshop there between Day 1 and Day 5.
#   • Milan: 7 days.
#   • Seville: 5 days.
#
# Although the sum of days (5 + 7 + 5 = 17) exceeds 15, by overlapping on flight days,
# the trip fits into 15 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Vilnius and Milan,
#   • between Milan and Seville.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Vilnius -> Milan -> Seville
#
# Using the convention that when a direct flight is taken on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day in one city and the first day in the next.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Vilnius to Milan.
#   d2 = flight day from Milan to Seville.
#
# Then the trip segments are:
#
# 1. Vilnius segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    Requirement: 5 days in Vilnius, so we have d1 = 5.
#    The workshop in Vilnius is then satisfied because it occurs between Day 1 and Day 5.
#
# 2. Milan segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    Requirement: 7 days in Milan, so: d2 - d1 + 1 = 7.
#    With d1 = 5, we get: d2 = 11.
#
# 3. Seville segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 15.
#    Duration = 15 - d2 + 1 days.
#    Requirement: 5 days in Seville, so: 15 - d2 + 1 = 5.
#    With d2 = 11, we have: 15 - 11 + 1 = 5.
#
# This itinerary satisfies all the constraints.
