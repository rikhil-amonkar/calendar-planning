# We have a 10-day trip visiting 3 European cities.
# The requirements are:
#   • Lyon: 2 days, and you want to attend an annual show in Lyon from Day 1 to Day 2.
#   • Amsterdam: 3 days.
#   • Santorini: 7 days.
#
# Note: Although the sum of days is 2 + 3 + 7 = 12,
# the overlap due to shared flight days allows the trip to fit within 10 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Lyon and Amsterdam,
#   • between Amsterdam and Santorini.
#
# Therefore, we choose the itinerary order:
#   Lyon -> Amsterdam -> Santorini
#
# We adopt the convention that when a direct flight is taken on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day in the departing city and the first day in the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Lyon to Amsterdam.
#   d2 = flight day from Amsterdam to Santorini.
#
# Then the segments are defined as follows:
#
# 1. Lyon segment:
#    From Day 1 to Day d1, the duration is d1 days.
#    We require 2 days in Lyon, so: d1 = 2.
#    This ensures that you attend the show in Lyon between Day 1 and Day 2.
#
# 2. Amsterdam segment:
#    From Day d1 to Day d2, the duration is (d2 - d1 + 1) days.
#    We require 3 days in Amsterdam, so: d2 - d1 + 1 = 3.
#    With d1 = 2, this gives: d2 = 4.
#
# 3. Santorini segment:
#    From Day d2 to Day 10, the duration is (10 - d2 + 1) days.
#    We require 7 days in Santorini, so: 10 - d2 + 1 = 7.
#    With d2 = 4, we get: 10 - 4 + 1 = 7.
#
# This itinerary meets all the requirements and uses only direct flights.

# Define flight day variables:

d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Amsterdam to Santorini.

# Lyon segment: must last 2 days => d1 = 2.
s.add(d1 == 2)

# Amsterdam segment: must last 3 days => d2 - d1 + 1 = 3.

# Santorini segment: must last 7 days => 10 - d2 + 1 = 7.
