# We have a 13-day trip and must visit 3 cities by using only direct flights.
# The requirements are:
#   • Venice: 6 days.
#   • Munich: 4 days.
#   • Mykonos: 5 days, and you want to meet your friends in Mykonos between day 9 and day 13.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Venice and Munich,
#   • between Munich and Mykonos.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Venice -> Munich -> Mykonos
#
# We adopt the convention that when a direct flight is taken on a day, that day counts as the
# last day at the departing city and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Venice to Munich.
#   d2 = flight day from Munich to Mykonos.
#
# The segments are then defined as:
#
# 1. Venice segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    With a requirement of 6 days in Venice, we set:
#         d1 = 6.
#
# 2. Munich segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    With a requirement of 4 days in Munich, we have:
#         d2 - d1 + 1 = 4.
#    With d1 = 6, this implies: d2 - 6 + 1 = 4, or d2 = 9.
#
# 3. Mykonos segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 13.
#    Duration = 13 - d2 + 1 days.
#    With a requirement of 5 days in Mykonos, we require:
#         13 - d2 + 1 = 5.
#    With d2 = 9, we get: 13 - 9 + 1 = 5.
#
# The Mykonos segment is exactly from day 9 to day 13, which meets the requirement to
# meet your friends in Mykonos between day 9 and day 13.
