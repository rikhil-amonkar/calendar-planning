# We have a 10-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • London: 5 days, and you want to meet a friend in London between Day 1 and Day 5.
#   • Istanbul: 2 days.
#   • Vilnius: 5 days.
#
# The total individual durations add up to 5 + 2 + 5 = 12 days.
# However, overlapping the flight days (each flight day counts as the last day in the departing city
# and the first day in the arriving city) reduces the overall trip duration to 10 days.
#
# Available direct flights:
#   • between London and Istanbul,
#   • between Istanbul and Vilnius.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   London -> Istanbul -> Vilnius
#
# Using the convention that a direct flight on a day counts as the final day in the city you're leaving
# and the first day in the city where you arrive, we define:
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from London to Istanbul.
#   d2 = flight day from Istanbul to Vilnius.
#
# Then the segments become:
#
# 1. London segment:
#    - Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    - Duration = d1 days.
#    - Must be 5 days in London, hence set: d1 = 5.
#
# 2. Istanbul segment:
#    - Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    - Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 2 days in Istanbul, so:
#         d2 - d1 + 1 = 2  ->  d2 = d1 + 1 = 6.
#
# 3. Vilnius segment:
#    - Runs from Day d2 to Day 10.
#    - Duration = 10 - d2 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 5 days in Vilnius, so:
#         10 - d2 + 1 = 5  -> 11 - d2 = 5  -> d2 = 6.
#
# Additionally, we want to meet a friend in London between Day 1 and Day 5.
# We introduce a variable "m" for the meeting day in London.
#
# With these constraints, the planned flight days are:
#   Flight from London to Istanbul on Day 5.
#   Flight from Istanbul to Vilnius on Day 6.
#
# This ensures:
#   - London: Day 1 to Day 5 (5 days; you can meet your friend on any day between 1 and 5).
#   - Istanbul: Day 5 to Day 6 (2 days).
#   - Vilnius: Day 6 to Day 10 (5 days).
