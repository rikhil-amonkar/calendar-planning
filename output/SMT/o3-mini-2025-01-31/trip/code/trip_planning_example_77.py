# We have an 11-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Hamburg: 4 days, and you must attend a conference in Hamburg on Day 1 and Day 4.
#   • Nice: 6 days.
#   • Lyon: 3 days.
#
# The individual durations add up to 4 + 6 + 3 = 13 days, 
# but by overlapping flight days, the trip fits into 11 days.
#
# Available direct flights:
#   • between Hamburg and Nice,
#   • between Nice and Lyon.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Hamburg -> Nice -> Lyon
#
# We adopt the convention that when a direct flight is taken on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day at the departing city and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Hamburg to Nice.
#   d2 = flight day from Nice to Lyon.
#
# Then the trip segments are defined as:
#
# 1. Hamburg segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    Since Hamburg must be 4 days and you need to be there on Day 1 and Day 4 for the conference,
#    we set d1 = 4.
#
# 2. Nice segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    Nice must be 6 days so:
#         d2 - d1 + 1 = 6.
#    With d1 = 4, this gives d2 = 9.
#
# 3. Lyon segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 11.
#    Duration = 11 - d2 + 1 days.
#    Lyon must be 3 days so:
#         11 - d2 + 1 = 3.
#    With d2 = 9, we have 11 - 9 + 1 = 3.
#
# This itinerary satisfies all the requirements, including attending the conference
# in Hamburg on days 1 and 4.
