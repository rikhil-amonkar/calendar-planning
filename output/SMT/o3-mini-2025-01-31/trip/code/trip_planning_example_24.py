# We have a 13-day trip visiting 3 cities (using only direct flights):
#   • Florence and Amsterdam have direct flights.
#   • Amsterdam and Riga have direct flights.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Florence: 4 days (with a workshop that must be attended between day 1 and day 4).
#   - Amsterdam: 6 days.
#   - Riga: 5 days.
#
# We model the itinerary using two flight days:
#   d1: the day you fly from Florence to Amsterdam.
#       → You are in Florence from day 1 to day d1.
#
#   d2: the day you fly from Amsterdam to Riga.
#       → You are in Amsterdam from day d1 to day d2.
#       → You are in Riga from day d2 to day 13.
#
# Counting durations (flight day counts for both cities):
#   - Florence duration = d1, so we need d1 = 4.
#   - Amsterdam duration = d2 - d1 + 1, which must equal 6.
#       => d2 - 4 + 1 = 6  =>  d2 = 9.
#   - Riga duration = 13 - d2 + 1 = 14 - d2, which must equal 5.
#       => 14 - d2 = 5  =>  d2 = 9.
#
# The workshop in Florence is scheduled between day 1 and day 4 and, since you are in Florence from day 1 until day 4 (inclusive),
# you can attend the workshop.
#
# Now we encode these constraints using Z3:

s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Florence to Amsterdam.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Amsterdam to Riga.

# Add constraints for each city's duration:
s.add(d1 == 4)                # Florence for 4 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 6)         # Amsterdam for 6 days.
s.add(14 - d2 == 5)             # Riga for 5 days.

# Enforce flight ordering and that flight days are within the 13-day trip.
s.add(d1 < d2)                # Must fly from Florence to Amsterdam before flying to Riga.
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 13)        # Both flight days must be within the 13-day period.

# Solve the constraints.
if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    d1_val = m[d1].as_long()  # Expected 4
    d2_val = m[d2].as_long()  # Expected 9
