# d2: flight day from Istanbul to Venice (overlap day for Istanbul and Venice)

# The overall trip is from day 1 to day 11.
# We assume the itinerary order following available direct flights:
#   Dubrovnik -> Istanbul -> Venice.
#
# Under the standard convention:
#   - Dubrovnik is visited from day 1 to d1  (duration = d1 days)
#   - Istanbul is visited from day d1 to d2   (duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days)
#   - Venice is visited from day d2 to day 11   (duration = 11 - d2 + 1 = 12 - d2 days)
#
# The given requirements are:
#   * Dubrovnik for 4 days  -> d1 = 4.
#   * Istanbul for 3 days   -> d2 - d1 + 1 = 3.
#   * Venice for 6 days     -> 12 - d2 = 6, which implies d2 = 6.
#
# Let's add these constraints to the solver.

# Duration constraints:
s.add(d1 == 4)                  # Dubrovnik must be 4 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 3)           # Istanbul must be 3 days.
s.add(12 - d2 == 6)               # Venice must be 6 days (equivalent to d2 = 6).

# This forces:
#   d1 = 4, and then from the second equation, d2 = d1 + 2 = 6, which satisfies the third equation.
#
# Chronological ordering:
s.add(d1 < d2)  # The flight from Dubrovnik to Istanbul happens before the flight from Istanbul to Venice.
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 11)
