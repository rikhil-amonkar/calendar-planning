# In this scheduling problem, you plan to visit 3 European cities using only direct flights. 
# You have a 10-day trip in total.
#
# Cities and requirements:
# 1. Mykonos: 2 days.
# 2. Vienna: 4 days.
# 3. Venice: 6 days, with the additional requirement that you attend a workshop in Venice 
#    sometime between day 5 and day 10.
#
# Available direct flights:
# - A direct flight exists between Mykonos and Vienna.
# - A direct flight exists between Vienna and Venice.
#
# With these flights, a valid itinerary is:
#     Mykonos -> Vienna -> Venice.
#
# We denote:
#   d1: the day when you take the flight from Mykonos to Vienna.
#       Therefore, you are in Mykonos from Day 1 to Day d1.
#
#   d2: the day when you take the flight from Vienna to Venice.
#       Therefore, you are in Vienna from Day d1 to Day d2, and in Venice from Day d2 to Day 10.
#
# When counting durations, note that the flight day is counted as part of both cities.
#
# The durations are then given by:
# - Mykonos duration = d1, which must equal 2.
# - Vienna duration = d2 - d1 + 1, which must equal 4.
# - Venice duration = 10 - d2 + 1 = 11 - d2, which must equal 6.
#
# The extra condition for Venice is that the period when you are in Venice 
# (from day d2 to day 10) must include the interval [5, 10]. 
# With the numbers below, we'll confirm that is the case.
#
# Solving the constraints:
#   Mykonos: d1 = 2.
#   Vienna: d2 - 2 + 1 = 4  =>  d2 - 1 = 4  =>  d2 = 5.
#   Venice: 11 - d2 = 11 - 5 = 6, which is correct.
#
# Because d2 = 5, you arrive in Venice on Day 5 and stay until Day 10, 
# hence the workshop requirement (attending it between day 5 and day 10) is satisfied.
#
# Now we encode these constraints with Z3.
s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Mykonos to Vienna.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Vienna to Venice.

# Add constraints for each city's required duration based on the above reasoning:
s.add(d1 == 2)              # Mykonos: Days 1 to d1;  d1 must be 2 for a 2-day visit.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 4)       # Vienna: Days d1 to d2 must total 4 days.
s.add(11 - d2 == 6)           # Venice: Days d2 to 10 must total 6 days (11 - d2 = 6).

# Enforce the proper flight order and ensure flight days are within the 10-day horizon.
s.add(d1 < d2)                # Must fly from Mykonos to Vienna before flying to Venice.
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 10)        # The flight days must fall within Day 1 and Day 10.

# The itinerary for Venice must allow attending the workshop between day 5 and day 10.
# Since Venice is visited from Day d2 onwards and d2 will be determined by the constraints above,
# we add an extra check that the Venice leg covers the interval [5, 10].
# In our model, this condition is satisfied if d2 <= 5 (so that Venice starts at or before day 5).
# However, from our computed solution, d2 = 5 perfectly fits the requirement.
s.add(d2 <= 5)

# Solve the constraints and display the trip plan:
if s.check() == sat:
    model = s.model()
    d1_val = model[d1].as_long()  # Expected to be 2
    d2_val = model[d2].as_long()  # Expected to be 5
