# We have an 8-day trip visiting 3 European cities with the following requirements:
#   • Bucharest: 3 days, with a meet-up with a friend in Bucharest between Day 1 and Day 3.
#   • Amsterdam: 2 days.
#   • Stuttgart: 5 days.
#
# The sum of days counted separately is 3 + 2 + 5 = 10 days,
# but overlapping flight days allow us to fit the trip into 8 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Bucharest and Amsterdam,
#   • between Amsterdam and Stuttgart.
#
# We choose the following itinerary order:
#   Bucharest -> Amsterdam -> Stuttgart
#
# We adopt the convention that when a direct flight is taken on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day at the departing city and the first day
# at the arrival city.
#
# Let's denote:
#   d1 = flight day from Bucharest to Amsterdam.
#   d2 = flight day from Amsterdam to Stuttgart.
#
# Then the trip segments become:
#
# 1. Bucharest segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    Since Bucharest must be 3 days, we set d1 = 3.
#
# 2. Amsterdam segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    Since Amsterdam must be 2 days, we impose: d2 - d1 + 1 = 2.
#    With d1 = 3, that yields: d2 - 3 + 1 = 2, so d2 = 4.
#
# 3. Stuttgart segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 8.
#    Duration = 8 - d2 + 1 days.
#    Since Stuttgart must be 5 days, we require: 8 - d2 + 1 = 5.
#    With d2 = 4, that gives: 8 - 4 + 1 = 5.
#
# These assignments satisfy all the conditions.
