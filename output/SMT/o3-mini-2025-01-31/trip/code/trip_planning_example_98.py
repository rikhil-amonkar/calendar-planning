# We have a 6-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Istanbul: 4 days.
#   • Copenhagen: 2 days.
#   • Split: 2 days, and you want to meet a friend in Split between Day 5 and Day 6.
#
# Without overlapping, the total would be: 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 days.
# By overlapping flight days (the flight day counts as the last day in one city and the first day in the next)
# we can compress the schedule into 6 days.
#
# Available direct flights:
#   • between Istanbul and Copenhagen,
#   • between Copenhagen and Split.
#
# This determines the itinerary order as:
#   Istanbul -> Copenhagen -> Split.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Istanbul to Copenhagen.
#   d2 = flight day from Copenhagen to Split.
#
# The segments are:
#
# 1. Istanbul segment:
#    - Runs from Day 1 to Day d1 (inclusive).
#    - Duration = d1 days.
#    - Must equal 4 days: d1 == 4.
#
# 2. Copenhagen segment:
#    - Runs from Day d1 to Day d2 (inclusive).
#    - Duration = (d2 - d1 + 1) days.
#    - Must equal 2 days: d2 - d1 + 1 == 2.
#
# 3. Split segment:
#    - Runs from Day d2 to Day 6 (inclusive).
#    - Duration = (6 - d2 + 1) days.
#    - Must equal 2 days: 6 - d2 + 1 == 2.
#
# Note: With d2 determined appropriately, the Split segment will cover Day 5 to Day 6,
# satisfying the requirement to meet your friend in Split between Day 5 and Day 6.
#
# Now we model these constraints using the Z3 solver.

s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Istanbul to Copenhagen.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Copenhagen to Split.

# Istanbul segment: Must last 4 days.
s.add(d1 == 4)

# Copenhagen segment: Must last 2 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 2)

# Split segment: Must last 2 days.
s.add(6 - d2 + 1 == 2)

# Enforce ordering: the flight from Istanbul to Copenhagen must happen before the flight from Copenhagen to Split.
s.add(d1 < d2)

# Ensure that the flight days fall within the total trip days.
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 6)
