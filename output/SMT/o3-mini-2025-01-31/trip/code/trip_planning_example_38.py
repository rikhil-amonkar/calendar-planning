# We plan a 5‑day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Geneva: 2 days.
#   • Madrid: 3 days.
#   • Venice: 2 days, with a conference in Venice during Day 4 and Day 5.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • from Geneva to Madrid,
#   • from Madrid to Venice.
#
# We assume the flight plan will be:
#   Geneva -> Madrid -> Venice.
#
# Using the convention that when you take a flight on a day, that day counts as both the last day in 
# the departure city and the first day in the arrival city, we define:
#
# Let:
#   d1 = the flight day from Geneva to Madrid.
#   d2 = the flight day from Madrid to Venice.
#
# Then the time spent in each city is modeled as:
#
#   Geneva:  Days 1 to d1,          duration = d1 days.      (should equal 2 days)
#   Madrid:  Days d1 to d2,          duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days. (should equal 3 days)
#   Venice:  Days d2 to Day 5,         duration = 5 - d2 + 1 = 6 - d2 days. (should equal 2 days)
#
# Our constraints are:
#   d1 == 2,                (Geneva: 2 days)
#   d2 - d1 + 1 == 3,       (Madrid: 3 days)
#   6 - d2 == 2,            (Venice: 2 days)
#
# Note that with d1 = 2 and d2 = 4, the conference in Venice that occurs on Day 4 and Day 5 
# is automatically attended.
#
# Now we encode and solve these constraints with Z3.
s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables.
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Geneva to Madrid.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Madrid to Venice.

# Add constraints for each city's visit duration.
s.add(d1 == 2)                # Geneva is visited for 2 days: Day 1 to Day 2.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 3)         # Madrid is visited for 3 days: Day d1 to Day d2.
s.add(6 - d2 == 2)              # Venice is visited for 2 days: Day d2 to Day 5.

# Enforce that the flights happen in order and the flight days are within the 5-day period.
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 5)
