# We have an 11-day trip visiting 3 European cities.
# The requirements are:
#   • Mykonos: 4 days, with a wedding in Mykonos between Day 1 and Day 4.
#   • Athens: 2 days.
#   • Bucharest: 7 days.
#
# Although the sum of days appears to be 4 + 2 + 7 = 13,
# we account for the fact that flight days serve as the last day of one segment and the first day of the next.
#
# Available direct flights are:
#   • between Mykonos and Athens,
#   • between Athens and Bucharest.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Mykonos -> Athens -> Bucharest
#
# The convention is that when you take a direct flight on a day,
# that day counts as both the final day at the departing city and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# Define:
#    d1 = flight day from Mykonos to Athens.
#    d2 = flight day from Athens to Bucharest.
#
# Then:
#
# 1. Mykonos segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    Requirement: 4 days in Mykonos (which includes the wedding between Day 1 and Day 4), so d1 must be 4.
#
# 2. Athens segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    Requirement: 2 days in Athens, hence d2 - d1 + 1 = 2.
#    With d1 = 4, this gives: d2 = 5.
#
# 3. Bucharest segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 11.
#    Duration = 11 - d2 + 1 days.
#    Requirement: 7 days in Bucharest, so 11 - d2 + 1 = 7.
#    With d2 = 5, we verify: 11 - 5 + 1 = 7.
#
# This itinerary meets all the scheduling requirements.

# Define flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Mykonos to Athens.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Athens to Bucharest.

# Mykonos segment: Must last 4 days.
# From Day 1 to Day d1, duration = d1 days, so d1 must equal 4.

# Athens segment: Must last 2 days.
# Duration = d2 - d1 + 1, hence: d2 - d1 + 1 = 2.

# Bucharest segment: Must last 7 days.
# Duration = 11 - d2 + 1, hence: 11 - d2 + 1 = 7.
