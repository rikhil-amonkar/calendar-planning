# We plan a 10‑day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Venice: 4 days, and you want to meet your friends there between Day 1 and Day 4.
#   • Dublin: 4 days.
#   • Porto:  4 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Venice and Dublin,
#   • between Dublin and Porto.
#
# We assume the itinerary is:
#   Venice -> Dublin -> Porto.
#
# We adopt the convention that when you take a flight on a day, that day counts as both
# the last day in the departure city and the first day in the arrival city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = the flight day from Venice to Dublin.
#   d2 = the flight day from Dublin to Porto.
#
# Then, the segments are defined as:
#   - Venice:  Days 1 to d1,        duration = d1 days.    (should equal 4 days)
#   - Dublin:  Days d1 to d2,         duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days. (should equal 4 days)
#   - Porto:   Days d2 to Day 10,     duration = 10 - d2 + 1 = 11 - d2 days. (should equal 4 days)
#
# The constraints are:
#   1. d1 == 4.
#   2. d2 - d1 + 1 == 4.
#   3. 11 - d2 == 4.
#
# Solving these gives:
#   d1 = 4,
#   d2 - 4 + 1 = 4   =>   d2 = 7,
#   11 - 7 = 4.
#
# These flight days yield:
#   • Venice: Days 1 to 4 (meeting your friends between Day 1 and Day 4).
#   • Dublin: Days 4 to 7.
#   • Porto: Days 7 to 10.
#
# The available flights match the itinerary:
#   • A direct flight from Venice to Dublin on Day 4.
#   • A direct flight from Dublin to Porto on Day 7.
#
# We now encode these constraints with the Z3 solver.
