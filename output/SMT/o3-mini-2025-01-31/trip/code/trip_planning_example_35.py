# We have a 10-day trip visiting three cities with the following requirements:
#   • Bucharest: 3 days.
#   • Zurich:    2 days.
#   • Dubrovnik: 7 days.
#
# Additionally, you plan to visit relatives in Dubrovnik between day 4 and day 10.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • Between Bucharest and Zurich.
#   • Between Zurich and Dubrovnik.
#
# With no direct flight between Bucharest and Dubrovnik, an acceptable itinerary is:
#   Bucharest -> Zurich -> Dubrovnik.
#
# We define:
#   d1 = flight day from Bucharest to Zurich.
#   d2 = flight day from Zurich to Dubrovnik.
#
# Using the convention that the flight day counts both as the last day at the departure city
# and the first day at the arrival city, we can partition the days as:
#
#   Bucharest:  Day 1 to Day d1,         duration = d1 days. (must be 3 days)
#   Zurich:     Day d1 to Day d2,         duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days. (must be 2 days)
#   Dubrovnik:  Day d2 to Day 10,         duration = 10 - d2 + 1 = 11 - d2 days. (must be 7 days)
#
# Setting up the constraints:
#
#   d1 == 3,
#   d2 - d1 + 1 == 2  => d2 - 3 + 1 == 2  => d2 == 4,
#   11 - d2 == 7     => 11 - 4 == 7.
#
# The meeting constraint in Dubrovnik is satisfied because you'll be in Dubrovnik
# from day d2 (which is 4) to day 10.
#
# Now, we use Z3 to model and solve these constraints.

# Create a Z3 solver instance.
s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables.
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Bucharest to Zurich.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Zurich to Dubrovnik.

# Add constraints for the durations in each city.
s.add(d1 == 3)                  # Bucharest must be visited for exactly 3 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 2)           # Zurich must be visited for exactly 2 days.
s.add(11 - d2 == 7)               # Dubrovnik must be visited for exactly 7 days.

# Ensure the flight order is followed and the flight days lie within [1, 10].
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 10)

# The meeting with relatives in Dubrovnik should occur between day 4 and day 10.
# Since you'll be in Dubrovnik from day d2 to day 10 and d2 is set to 4, this is satisfied.
s.add(d2 >= 4)

# Check if the constraints are satisfiable and print the plan.
if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    d1_val = m[d1].as_long()  # Expected: 3
