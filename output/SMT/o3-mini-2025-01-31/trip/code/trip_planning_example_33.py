# We have a 13-day trip and 3 cities with required durations, and a meeting constraint:
#   • Rome:      4 days (visit)
#   • Barcelona: 7 days (visit)
#   • Krakow:    4 days (visit)
# Additionally, you want to meet a friend in Krakow between day 10 and day 13.
#
# The available direct flights are between:
#   • Rome and Barcelona, and between Barcelona and Krakow.
#
# Since there is no direct flight between Rome and Krakow, one acceptable itinerary is:
#   Rome -> Barcelona -> Krakow.
#
# We model the itinerary with two flight days:
#   Let d1 = the flight day from Rome to Barcelona.
#   Let d2 = the flight day from Barcelona to Krakow.
#
# We use the convention that the flight day is counted toward both departure and arrival cities.
# Thus the time spent in each city is:
#
# - In Rome:    from Day 1 to Day d1, with duration = d1.
# - In Barcelona: from Day d1 to Day d2, with duration = d2 - d1 + 1.
# - In Krakow:  from Day d2 to Day 13, with duration = 13 - d2 + 1 = 14 - d2.
#
# The requirements become:
#
#   Rome duration:        d1            = 4.
#   Barcelona duration:   d2 - d1 + 1   = 7,  so d2 - 4 + 1 = 7  => d2 = 10.
#   Krakow duration:      14 - d2       = 4,  so 14 - 10 = 4.
#
# Moreover, the meeting in Krakow must occur between Day 10 and Day 13.
# Since you will be in Krakow from Day d2 (which will be 10) to Day 13, the meeting constraint is met.
#
# Now we set these constraints in a Z3 model:

s = Solver()

# Define the flight day variables:
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Rome to Barcelona.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Barcelona to Krakow.

# Set the duration constraints:
s.add(d1 == 4)                 # Stay in Rome for 4 days (Days 1 to 4).
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 7)          # Stay in Barcelona for 7 days (Days d1 to d2).
s.add(14 - d2 == 4)              # Stay in Krakow for 4 days (Days d2 to 13).

# Enforce the flights occur in order and within the overall schedule:
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 13)

# Friend meeting constraint: Meet your friend in Krakow between day 10 and 13.
# Since you'll be in Krakow from day d2 to 13 and d2 == 10, this condition is satisfied.
s.add(d2 >= 10)

if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    d1_val = m[d1].as_long()  # Expected: 4
    d2_val = m[d2].as_long()  # Expected: 10

    print("1. Stay in Rome from Day 1 to Day {} (4 days).".format(d1_val))
    print("   -> On Day {}, take a direct flight from Rome to Barcelona.".format(d1_val))
    print("2. Stay in Barcelona from Day {} to Day {} (7 days).".format(d1_val, d2_val))
    print("   -> On Day {}, take a direct flight from Barcelona to Krakow.".format(d2_val))
    print("3. Stay in Krakow from Day {} to Day 13 (4 days).".format(d2_val))
