# We have a 13-day trip visiting 3 cities with the following requirements:
#   • Zurich: 2 days.
#   • Lisbon: 7 days.
#   • Lyon: 6 days, with a conference in Lyon on Day 8 and Day 13.
#
# The sum of individual durations is 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 days.
# By overlapping the flight days (each flight day counts as both the last day in
# one city and the first day in the next), we can schedule the trip in 13 days.
#
# Available direct flights:
#   • between Zurich and Lisbon,
#   • between Lisbon and Lyon.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Zurich -> Lisbon -> Lyon
#
# We use the following convention:
#  - A flight taken on a day counts as the last day in the city departing and the first day in
#    the city arriving.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Zurich to Lisbon.
#   d2 = flight day from Lisbon to Lyon.
#
# Then:
#
# 1. Zurich segment:
#    - Runs from day 1 to day d1.
#    - Duration: d1 days.
#    - Must be 2 days, so we set: d1 == 2.
#
# 2. Lisbon segment:
#    - Runs from day d1 to day d2.
#    - Duration: d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 7 days, so we require: d2 - d1 + 1 == 7.
#      With d1 == 2, this gives: d2 == 8.
#
# 3. Lyon segment:
#    - Runs from day d2 to day 13.
#    - Duration: 13 - d2 + 1 days.
#    - Must be 6 days, so we require: 13 - d2 + 1 == 6.
#      With d2 == 8, we verify: 13 - 8 + 1 == 6.
#
# Additionally, you must attend a conference in Lyon on Day 8 and Day 13.
# With d2 == 8, the Lyon segment covers days 8 through 13, so these requirements are met.
#
# Now we model these constraints using the Z3 solver.

s = Solver()

# Define flight day variables
d1 = Int('d1')  # Flight day from Zurich to Lisbon.
d2 = Int('d2')  # Flight day from Lisbon to Lyon.

# Constraint for Zurich segment: 2 days.
s.add(d1 == 2)

# Constraint for Lisbon segment: 7 days.
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 7)

# Constraint for Lyon segment: 6 days.
s.add(13 - d2 + 1 == 6)

# Enforce proper ordering of flight days and day boundaries.
s.add(d1 < d2)
s.add(d1 >= 1, d2 <= 13)
