# We plan an 11-day trip visiting 3 cities with these requirements:
#   • Stockholm: 3 days, and you must attend a conference in Stockholm on Day 1 and Day 3.
#   • Manchester: 5 days.
#   • Seville: 5 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • between Stockholm and Manchester,
#   • between Manchester and Seville.
#
# We assume the itinerary in the following order:
#   Stockholm -> Manchester -> Seville.
#
# We adopt the convention that when you take a flight on a day, that day counts as both the last day in 
# the departure city and the first day in the arrival city.
#
# Define:
#   d1 = the flight day from Stockholm to Manchester.
#   d2 = the flight day from Manchester to Seville.
#
# Then the segments are:
#
# 1. Stockholm: Days 1 to d1, duration = d1 days. This segment must be 3 days (also meeting the conference 
#    requirements on Day 1 and Day 3).
#    --> d1 = 3.
#
# 2. Manchester: Days d1 to d2, duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days. This segment must be 5 days.
#    --> d2 - 3 + 1 = 5  
#    --> d2 - 2 = 5  
#    --> d2 = 7.
#
# 3. Seville: Days d2 to Day 11, duration = 11 - d2 + 1 = 12 - d2 days. This segment must be 5 days.
#    --> 12 - d2 = 5  
#    --> d2 = 7.
#
# The flight days are therefore:
#   d1 = 3 (flight from Stockholm to Manchester on Day 3)
#   d2 = 7 (flight from Manchester to Seville on Day 7)
#
# This results in:
#   • Stockholm: Days 1 to 3 (3 days; conference on Day 1 and Day 3).
#   • Manchester: Days 3 to 7 (5 days).
#   • Seville: Days 7 to 11 (5 days).
#
# Now we encode these constraints using Z3.

s.add(12 - d2 == 5)               # Seville for 5 days: Days d2 to 11.

# Enforce flight order and ensure flight days fall within the 11-day trip.
