# We have an 8-day trip visiting 3 European cities with the following requirements:
#   • Brussels: 2 days, and you attend a wedding in Brussels between Day 1 and Day 2.
#   • London: 6 days.
#   • Stuttgart: 2 days.
#
# Although the individual durations add up to 10 days, overlapping flight days enable the trip to fit in 8 days.
#
# Available direct flights:
#   • between Brussels and London,
#   • between London and Stuttgart.
#
# We choose the itinerary order:
#   Brussels -> London -> Stuttgart
#
# We adopt the convention that when taking a direct flight on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day at the departing city and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = flight day from Brussels to London.
#   d2 = flight day from London to Stuttgart.
#
# The trip segments then become:
#
# 1. Brussels segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    Since Brussels must be 2 days, we set:
#         d1 = 2.
#    This segment (Days 1-2) covers the wedding requirement.
#
# 2. London segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    London must be 6 days:
#         d2 - d1 + 1 = 6.
#    With d1 = 2, we have: d2 - 2 + 1 = 6, so d2 = 7.
#
# 3. Stuttgart segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 8.
#    Duration = 8 - d2 + 1 days.
#    Stuttgart must be 2 days:
#         8 - d2 + 1 = 2.
#    With d2 = 7, we get: 8 - 7 + 1 = 2.
#
# This itinerary meets all the requirements including the wedding in Brussels.
