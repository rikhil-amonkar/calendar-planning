# We have a 4-day trip visiting 3 European cities.
# The requirements are:
#   • Manchester: 2 days.
#   • Split: 2 days, with a friend meeting in Split occurring between Day 2 and Day 3.
#   • Geneva: 2 days.
#
# Note: When you take a flight on a day, that day counts as the last day at the departing city
# and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • from Manchester to Split,
#   • between Split and Geneva.
#
# Observe: With an itinerary order Manchester -> Split -> Geneva, the days overlap.
# For an itinerary with segments lasting A, B, and C days respectively,
# the total days = A + B + C - 2.
# With A = 2, B = 2, and C = 2, the total days = 2 + 2 + 2 - 2 = 4.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = the flight day from Manchester to Split,
#   d2 = the flight day from Split to Geneva.
#
# Then the segments are:
#   1. Manchester: Days 1 to d1, with duration = d1 days, must equal 2 days
#      --> d1 = 2.
#
#   2. Split: Days d1 to d2, duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days, must equal 2 days
#      --> d2 - d1 + 1 = 2  --> with d1 = 2, d2 = 3.
#
#   3. Geneva: Days d2 to Day 4, duration = 4 - d2 + 1 = 5 - d2 days, must equal 2 days
#      --> 5 - d2 = 2  --> d2 = 3.
#
# The friend meeting requirement in Split is for a day between Day 2 and Day 3.
# Since your stay in Split covers Days 2 and 3 (because d1=2 and d2=3),
# you will be in Split on both Day 2 and Day 3.
#
# Thus, the itinerary is:
#   • Manchester: Days 1 to 2 (2 days).
#       (Flight from Manchester to Split occurs on Day 2.)
#   • Split: Days 2 to 3 (2 days; friend meeting can be held on either Day 2 or Day 3).
#       (Flight from Split to Geneva occurs on Day 3.)
#   • Geneva: Days 3 to 4 (2 days).
