# We have a 13-day trip visiting 3 European cities with the following requirements:
#   • Dublin: 5 days.
#   • Manchester: 3 days, with a visit to relatives in Manchester between Day 5 and Day 7.
#   • Split: 7 days.
#
# Although the total sums to 5 + 3 + 7 = 15 days, the overlap on flight days makes the trip fit in 13 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • Dublin and Manchester
#   • from Manchester to Split
#   • Dublin and Split (provided, but not used in this itinerary)
#
# One possible itinerary order is:
#   Dublin -> Manchester -> Split
#
# We adopt the convention that when a direct flight is taken on a day,
# that day counts as both the last day at the departing city and the first day at the arriving city.
#
# Define:
#   d1 = flight day from Dublin to Manchester.
#   d2 = flight day from Manchester to Split.
#
# Then the segments are set up as follows:
#
# 1. Dublin segment:
#    Runs from Day 1 to Day d1.
#    Duration = d1 days.
#    Given the requirement of 5 days in Dublin, we have: d1 = 5.
#
# 2. Manchester segment:
#    Runs from Day d1 to Day d2.
#    Duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days.
#    Given the requirement of 3 days in Manchester, we have: d2 - d1 + 1 = 3.
#    With d1 = 5, this implies: d2 = 7.
#
#    Also, the Manchester segment covers exactly Days 5 to 7,
#    satisfying the requirement to visit relatives in Manchester between Day 5 and Day 7.
#
# 3. Split segment:
#    Runs from Day d2 to Day 13.
#    Duration = 13 - d2 + 1 days.
#    Given the requirement of 7 days in Split, we have: 13 - d2 + 1 = 7.
#    With d2 = 7, this verifies: 13 - 7 + 1 = 7.
#
# This itinerary satisfies all the constraints using direct flights.
