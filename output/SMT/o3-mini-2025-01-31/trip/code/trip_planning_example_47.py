# We have a 7-day trip visiting 3 European cities.
# The requirements are:
#   • Paris: 2 days, and you must attend a conference in Paris on Day 1 and Day 2.
#   • Istanbul: 2 days.
#   • Salzburg: 5 days.
#
# The available direct flights are:
#   • a flight between Paris and Istanbul,
#   • a flight between Istanbul and Salzburg.
#
# We assume the itinerary order is:
#   Paris -> Istanbul -> Salzburg.
#
# We use the convention that when you take a flight on a day, that day counts as both the last day in the 
# departing city and the first day in the arriving city.
#
# Let:
#   d1 = the flight day from Paris to Istanbul,
#   d2 = the flight day from Istanbul to Salzburg.
#
# Then the segments are:
#   1. Paris: Days 1 to d1, duration = d1 days. We require d1 = 2.
#
#   2. Istanbul: Days d1 to d2, duration = d2 - d1 + 1 days. We require this to be 2 days.
#      So: d2 - d1 + 1 = 2  --> with d1 = 2, d2 - 2 + 1 = 2  --> d2 = 3.
#
#   3. Salzburg: Days d2 to Day 7, duration = 7 - d2 + 1 days. We require this to be 5 days.
#      So: 7 - d2 + 1 = 5  --> 8 - d2 = 5  --> d2 = 3.
#
# The solution is:
#   d1 = 2, d2 = 3.
#
# This means:
#   • Stay in Paris from Day 1 to Day 2 (2 days; conference attended on Day 1 and Day 2).
#   • On Day 2, fly to Istanbul.
#   • Stay in Istanbul from Day 2 to Day 3 (2 days).
#   • On Day 3, fly to Salzburg.
#   • Stay in Salzburg from Day 3 to Day 7 (5 days).
