# We define two flight day variables:
# d1: Flight day from Bucharest to Frankfurt (overlap day for Bucharest and Frankfurt)
# d2: Flight day from Frankfurt to Stuttgart (overlap day for Frankfurt and Stuttgart)
#
# We follow the itinerary order based on the available direct flights:
#   Bucharest -> Frankfurt -> Stuttgart
#
# We use the following convention:
#   - Bucharest is visited from Day 1 to d1 (inclusive)
#   - Frankfurt is visited from Day d1 to d2 (inclusive)
#   - Stuttgart is visited from Day d2 to Day 10 (inclusive)
#
# The requirements are:
#   * Bucharest for 3 days  ---> Duration in Bucharest: d1 = 3
#   * Frankfurt for 3 days   ---> Duration in Frankfurt: (d2 - d1 + 1) = 3
#   * Stuttgart for 6 days   ---> Duration in Stuttgart: (10 - d2 + 1) = 6
#
# Also, you must attend a workshop in Stuttgart between Day 5 and Day 10.
# Since the Stuttgart leg runs from d2 to 10 and as we will see d2 becomes 5,
# this condition is automatically satisfied.
#
# Adding all these constraints into our Z3 solver:

# Create the Z3 Solver
s = Solver()

# Bucharest leg: duration must be 3 days
s.add(d1 == 3)

# Frankfurt leg: duration must be 3 days
s.add(d2 - d1 + 1 == 3)  # which forces d2 = d1 + 2

# Stuttgart leg: duration must be 6 days
s.add(10 - d2 + 1 == 6)  # which forces d2 = 5

# The ordering is implicit:
s.add(d1 < d2)  # Flight from Bucharest to Frankfurt happens before flight to Stuttgart

# Additionally, workshop in Stuttgart must be attended between Day 5 and Day 10.
# Since Stuttgart leg is from day d2 to 10 and d2 = 5, the workshop condition is met.
s.add(d2 >= 5, d2 <= 10)

# Check for a solution
