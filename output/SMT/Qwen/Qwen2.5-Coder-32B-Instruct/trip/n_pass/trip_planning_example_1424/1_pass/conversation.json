You would like to visit Warsaw for 3 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 5 days. You have to attend a workshop in Porto between day 1 and day 5. You plan to stay in Naples for 4 days. During day 17 and day 20, you have to attend a conference in Naples. You plan to stay in Brussels for 3 days. From day 20 to day 22, there is a annual show you want to attend in Brussels. You would like to visit Split for 3 days. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 5 days. You want to spend 4 days in Amsterdam. You plan to visit relatives in Amsterdam between day 5 and day 8. You want to spend 3 days in Lyon. You plan to stay in Helsinki for 4 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Helsinki between day 8 and day 11. You plan to stay in Valencia for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nAmsterdam and Warsaw, Helsinki and Brussels, Helsinki and Warsaw, Reykjavik and Brussels, Amsterdam and Lyon, Amsterdam and Naples, Amsterdam and Reykjavik, Naples and Valencia, Porto and Brussels, Amsterdam and Split, Lyon and Split, Warsaw and Split, Porto and Amsterdam, Helsinki and Split, Brussels and Lyon, Porto and Lyon, Reykjavik and Warsaw, Brussels and Valencia, Valencia and Lyon, Porto and Warsaw, Warsaw and Valencia, Amsterdam and Helsinki, Porto and Valencia, Warsaw and Brussels, Warsaw and Naples, Naples and Split, Helsinki and Naples, Helsinki and Reykjavik, Amsterdam and Valencia, Naples and Brussels.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 27 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
