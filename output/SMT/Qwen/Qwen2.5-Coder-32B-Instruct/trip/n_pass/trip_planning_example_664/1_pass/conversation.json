You plan to stay in Tallinn for 2 days. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Bucharest between day 1 and day 4. You want to spend 5 days in Seville. You would like to meet your friends at Seville between day 8 and day 12 to tour together. You would like to visit Stockholm for 5 days. You plan to stay in Munich for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Munich between day 4 and day 8. You would like to visit Milan for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMilan and Stockholm, Munich and Stockholm, Bucharest and Munich, Munich and Seville, Stockholm and Tallinn, Munich and Milan, Munich and Tallinn, Seville and Milan.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 18 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
