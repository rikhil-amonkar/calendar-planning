You would like to visit Oslo for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Oslo between day 3 and day 4 to tour together. You want to spend 3 days in Stuttgart. You would like to visit Venice for 4 days. You plan to stay in Split for 4 days. You plan to stay in Barcelona for 3 days. From day 1 to day 3, there is a annual show you want to attend in Barcelona. You would like to visit Brussels for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Brussels between day 9 and day 11. You would like to visit Copenhagen for 3 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nVenice and Stuttgart, Oslo and Brussels, Split and Copenhagen, Barcelona and Copenhagen, Barcelona and Venice, Brussels and Venice, Barcelona and Stuttgart, Copenhagen and Brussels, Oslo and Split, Oslo and Venice, Barcelona and Split, Oslo and Copenhagen, Barcelona and Oslo, Copenhagen and Stuttgart, Split and Stuttgart, Copenhagen and Venice, Barcelona and Brussels.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
