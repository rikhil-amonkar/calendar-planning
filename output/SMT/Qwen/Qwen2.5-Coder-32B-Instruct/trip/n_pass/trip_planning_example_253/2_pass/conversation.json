You want to spend 3 days in Amsterdam. You have to attend a workshop in Amsterdam between day 9 and day 11. You would like to visit Vienna for 7 days. You want to spend 4 days in Santorini. You want to spend 3 days in Lyon. You are going to attend a wedding in Lyon between day 7 and day 9.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nVienna and Lyon, Vienna and Santorini, Vienna and Amsterdam, Amsterdam and Santorini, Lyon and Amsterdam.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 14 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
