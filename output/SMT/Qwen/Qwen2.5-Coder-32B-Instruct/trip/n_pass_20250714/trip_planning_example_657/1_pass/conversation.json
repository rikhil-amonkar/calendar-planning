You want to spend 4 days in Frankfurt. From day 13 to day 16, there is a annual show you want to attend in Frankfurt. You want to spend 4 days in Manchester. You would like to visit Valencia for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Naples. You plan to stay in Oslo for 3 days. You plan to stay in Vilnius for 2 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Vilnius between day 12 and day 13.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nValencia and Frankfurt, Manchester and Frankfurt, Naples and Manchester, Naples and Frankfurt, Naples and Oslo, Oslo and Frankfurt, Vilnius and Frankfurt, Oslo and Vilnius, Manchester and Oslo, Valencia and Naples.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
