You would like to visit Venice for 3 days. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 2 days. You would like to visit Munich for 3 days. From day 4 to day 6, there is a annual show you want to attend in Munich. You would like to visit Santorini for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Santorini between day 8 and day 10. You would like to visit Manchester for 3 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 3 days. You would like to visit Bucharest for 5 days. You want to spend 4 days in Tallinn. You want to spend 2 days in Valencia. You have to attend a workshop in Valencia between day 14 and day 15. You plan to stay in Vienna for 5 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBucharest and Manchester, Munich and Venice, Santorini and Manchester, Vienna and Reykjavik, Venice and Santorini, Munich and Porto, Valencia and Vienna, Manchester and Vienna, Porto and Vienna, Venice and Manchester, Santorini and Vienna, Munich and Manchester, Munich and Reykjavik, Bucharest and Valencia, Venice and Vienna, Bucharest and Vienna, Porto and Manchester, Munich and Vienna, Valencia and Porto, Munich and Bucharest, Tallinn and Munich, Santorini and Bucharest, Munich and Valencia.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 24 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
