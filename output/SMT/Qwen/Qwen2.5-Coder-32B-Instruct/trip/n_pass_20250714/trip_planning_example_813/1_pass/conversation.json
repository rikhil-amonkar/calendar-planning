You want to spend 5 days in Seville. You would like to visit Vilnius for 3 days. You would like to visit Santorini for 2 days. You want to spend 2 days in London. You would like to meet your friends at London between day 9 and day 10 to tour together. You plan to stay in Stuttgart for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Stuttgart between day 7 and day 9. You want to spend 3 days in Dublin. You would like to visit Frankfurt for 5 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nFrankfurt and Dublin, Frankfurt and London, London and Dublin, Vilnius and Frankfurt, Frankfurt and Stuttgart, Dublin and Seville, London and Santorini, Stuttgart and London, Santorini and Dublin.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 17 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
