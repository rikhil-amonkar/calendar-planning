You want to spend 5 days in Prague. You would like to visit Tallinn for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Tallinn between day 18 and day 20. You plan to stay in Warsaw for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Porto. You plan to stay in Naples for 5 days. You plan to stay in Milan for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Milan between day 24 and day 26. You would like to visit Lisbon for 5 days. You plan to stay in Santorini for 5 days. You plan to stay in Riga for 4 days. From day 5 to day 8, there is a annual show you want to attend in Riga. You would like to visit Stockholm for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nRiga and Prague, Stockholm and Milan, Riga and Milan, Lisbon and Stockholm, from Stockholm to Santorini, Naples and Warsaw, Lisbon and Warsaw, Naples and Milan, Lisbon and Naples, from Riga to Tallinn, Tallinn and Prague, Stockholm and Warsaw, Riga and Warsaw, Lisbon and Riga, Riga and Stockholm, Lisbon and Porto, Lisbon and Prague, Milan and Porto, Prague and Milan, Lisbon and Milan, Warsaw and Porto, Warsaw and Tallinn, Santorini and Milan, Stockholm and Prague, Stockholm and Tallinn, Warsaw and Milan, Santorini and Naples, Warsaw and Prague.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 28 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
