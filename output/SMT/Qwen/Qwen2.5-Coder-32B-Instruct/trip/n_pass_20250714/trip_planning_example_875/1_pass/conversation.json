You plan to stay in Stuttgart for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Stuttgart between day 11 and day 13. You want to spend 4 days in Edinburgh. You want to spend 4 days in Athens. You would like to visit Split for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Split between day 13 and day 14 to tour together. You would like to visit Krakow for 4 days. You want to meet a friend in Krakow between day 8 and day 11. You want to spend 5 days in Venice. You want to spend 4 days in Mykonos.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nKrakow and Split, Split and Athens, Edinburgh and Krakow, Venice and Stuttgart, Krakow and Stuttgart, Edinburgh and Stuttgart, Stuttgart and Athens, Venice and Edinburgh, Athens and Mykonos, Venice and Athens, Stuttgart and Split, Edinburgh and Athens.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 20 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
