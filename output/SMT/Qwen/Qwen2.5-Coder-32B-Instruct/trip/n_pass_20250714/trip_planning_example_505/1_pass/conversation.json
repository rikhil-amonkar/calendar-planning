You plan to stay in Prague for 4 days. You plan to stay in Stuttgart for 2 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Stuttgart between day 2 and day 3. You would like to visit Split for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Split between day 3 and day 4 to tour together. You plan to stay in Krakow for 2 days. You plan to stay in Florence for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nStuttgart and Split, Prague and Florence, Krakow and Stuttgart, Krakow and Split, Split and Prague, Krakow and Prague.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 8 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
