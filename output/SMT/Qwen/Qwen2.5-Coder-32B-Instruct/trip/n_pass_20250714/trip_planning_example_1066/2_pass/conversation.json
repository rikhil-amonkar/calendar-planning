You would like to visit Brussels for 4 days. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 3 days. You want to spend 4 days in Stuttgart. You want to meet a friend in Stuttgart between day 1 and day 4. You would like to visit Mykonos for 2 days. You want to spend 2 days in Madrid. During day 20 and day 21, you have to attend a conference in Madrid. You would like to visit Helsinki for 5 days. You would like to visit Split for 3 days. You plan to stay in London for 5 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nHelsinki and London, Split and Madrid, Helsinki and Madrid, London and Madrid, Brussels and London, Bucharest and London, Brussels and Bucharest, Bucharest and Madrid, Split and Helsinki, Mykonos and Madrid, Stuttgart and London, Helsinki and Brussels, Brussels and Madrid, Split and London, Stuttgart and Split, London and Mykonos.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 21 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
