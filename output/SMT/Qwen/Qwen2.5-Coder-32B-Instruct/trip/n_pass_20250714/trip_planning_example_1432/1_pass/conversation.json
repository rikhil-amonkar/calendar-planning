You plan to stay in Frankfurt for 4 days. You plan to stay in Salzburg for 5 days. You plan to stay in Athens for 5 days. You have to attend a workshop in Athens between day 14 and day 18. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 5 days. You would like to visit Bucharest for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Valencia. From day 5 to day 6, there is a annual show you want to attend in Valencia. You would like to visit Vienna for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Vienna between day 6 and day 10. You would like to visit Amsterdam for 3 days. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Stockholm between day 1 and day 3. You plan to stay in Riga for 3 days. During day 18 and day 20, you have to attend a conference in Riga.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nValencia and Frankfurt, Vienna and Bucharest, from Valencia to Athens, Athens and Bucharest, Riga and Frankfurt, Stockholm and Athens, Amsterdam and Bucharest, from Athens to Riga, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, Stockholm and Vienna, Vienna and Riga, Amsterdam and Reykjavik, Reykjavik and Frankfurt, Stockholm and Amsterdam, Amsterdam and Valencia, Vienna and Frankfurt, Valencia and Bucharest, Bucharest and Frankfurt, Stockholm and Frankfurt, Valencia and Vienna, from Reykjavik to Athens, Frankfurt and Salzburg, Amsterdam and Vienna, Stockholm and Reykjavik, Amsterdam and Riga, Stockholm and Riga, Vienna and Reykjavik, Amsterdam and Athens, Athens and Frankfurt, Vienna and Athens, Riga and Bucharest.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 29 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
