You plan to stay in Amsterdam for 4 days. You plan to visit relatives in Amsterdam between day 5 and day 8. You plan to stay in Edinburgh for 5 days. You want to spend 5 days in Brussels. You want to spend 5 days in Vienna. You plan to stay in Berlin for 4 days. You want to meet a friend in Berlin between day 16 and day 19. You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 5 days. You have to attend a workshop in Reykjavik between day 12 and day 16.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nEdinburgh and Berlin, Amsterdam and Berlin, Edinburgh and Amsterdam, Vienna and Berlin, Berlin and Brussels, Vienna and Reykjavik, Edinburgh and Brussels, Vienna and Brussels, Amsterdam and Reykjavik, Reykjavik and Brussels, Amsterdam and Vienna, Reykjavik and Berlin.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 23 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
