You would like to visit Prague for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Prague between day 1 and day 3. You would like to visit Warsaw for 4 days. You would like to meet your friends at Warsaw between day 20 and day 23 to tour together. You want to spend 3 days in Dublin. You would like to visit Athens for 3 days. You would like to visit Vilnius for 4 days. You would like to visit Porto for 5 days. During day 16 and day 20, you have to attend a conference in Porto. You plan to stay in London for 3 days. You are going to attend a wedding in London between day 3 and day 5. You want to spend 2 days in Seville. You plan to stay in Lisbon for 5 days. You plan to visit relatives in Lisbon between day 5 and day 9. You plan to stay in Dubrovnik for 3 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nWarsaw and Vilnius, Prague and Athens, London and Lisbon, Lisbon and Porto, Prague and Lisbon, London and Dublin, Athens and Vilnius, Athens and Dublin, Prague and London, London and Warsaw, Dublin and Seville, Seville and Porto, Lisbon and Athens, Dublin and Porto, Athens and Warsaw, Lisbon and Warsaw, Porto and Warsaw, Prague and Warsaw, Prague and Dublin, Athens and Dubrovnik, Lisbon and Dublin, Dubrovnik and Dublin, Lisbon and Seville, London and Athens.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 26 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The constraints ensure that the visits do not overlap and respect the specific days required for events. Note that the constraints for non-overlapping visits and direct flights are simplified and may need to be expanded for a full solution."
