You want to spend 3 days in Mykonos. You would like to visit Reykjavik for 2 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Reykjavik between day 9 and day 10. You want to spend 5 days in Dublin. From day 2 to day 6, there is a annual show you want to attend in Dublin. You plan to stay in London for 5 days. You plan to stay in Helsinki for 4 days. You would like to visit Hamburg for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Hamburg between day 1 and day 2 to tour together.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nDublin and London, Hamburg and Dublin, Helsinki and Reykjavik, Hamburg and London, Dublin and Helsinki, Reykjavik and London, London and Mykonos, Dublin and Reykjavik, Hamburg and Helsinki, Helsinki and London.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
