You want to spend 3 days in Stockholm. You plan to stay in Hamburg for 5 days. You would like to visit Florence for 2 days. You would like to visit Istanbul for 5 days. From day 25 to day 29, there is a annual show you want to attend in Istanbul. You would like to visit Oslo for 5 days. You would like to visit Vilnius for 5 days. You plan to stay in Santorini for 2 days. You plan to stay in Munich for 5 days. You would like to visit Frankfurt for 4 days. You want to spend 5 days in Krakow. You have to attend a workshop in Krakow between day 5 and day 9.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nOslo and Stockholm, Krakow and Frankfurt, Krakow and Istanbul, Munich and Stockholm, Hamburg and Stockholm, from Krakow to Vilnius, Oslo and Istanbul, Istanbul and Stockholm, Oslo and Krakow, Vilnius and Istanbul, Oslo and Vilnius, Frankfurt and Istanbul, Oslo and Frankfurt, Munich and Hamburg, Munich and Istanbul, Oslo and Munich, Frankfurt and Florence, Oslo and Hamburg, Vilnius and Frankfurt, from Florence to Munich, Krakow and Munich, Hamburg and Istanbul, Frankfurt and Stockholm, from Stockholm to Santorini, Frankfurt and Munich, from Santorini to Oslo, Krakow and Stockholm, from Vilnius to Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 32 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then constructs the itinerary based on the model provided by the solver. Note that the order of cities in the `cities` dictionary and the logic for ensuring direct flights might need adjustments based on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem."
