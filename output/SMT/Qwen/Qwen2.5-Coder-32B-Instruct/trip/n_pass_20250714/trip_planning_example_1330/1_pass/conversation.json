You plan to stay in Salzburg for 2 days. You want to spend 5 days in Venice. You would like to visit Bucharest for 4 days. You would like to visit Brussels for 2 days. You would like to meet your friends at Brussels between day 21 and day 22 to tour together. You want to spend 4 days in Hamburg. You want to spend 4 days in Copenhagen. You are going to attend a wedding in Copenhagen between day 18 and day 21. You plan to stay in Nice for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Nice between day 9 and day 11. You plan to stay in Zurich for 5 days. You plan to stay in Naples for 4 days. You have to attend a workshop in Naples between day 22 and day 25.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nZurich and Brussels, Bucharest and Copenhagen, Venice and Brussels, Nice and Zurich, Hamburg and Nice, Zurich and Naples, Hamburg and Bucharest, Zurich and Copenhagen, Bucharest and Brussels, Hamburg and Brussels, Venice and Naples, Venice and Copenhagen, Bucharest and Naples, Hamburg and Copenhagen, Venice and Zurich, Nice and Brussels, Hamburg and Venice, Copenhagen and Naples, Nice and Naples, Hamburg and Zurich, Salzburg and Hamburg, Zurich and Bucharest, Brussels and Naples, Copenhagen and Brussels, Venice and Nice, Nice and Copenhagen.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
