You would like to visit Reykjavik for 5 days. You plan to stay in Istanbul for 4 days. You would like to meet your friends at Istanbul between day 5 and day 8 to tour together. You would like to visit Edinburgh for 5 days. You want to spend 2 days in Oslo. You plan to visit relatives in Oslo between day 8 and day 9. You want to spend 3 days in Stuttgart. You want to spend 5 days in Bucharest.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBucharest and Oslo, Istanbul and Oslo, from Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Bucharest and Istanbul, Stuttgart and Edinburgh, Istanbul and Edinburgh, Oslo and Reykjavik, Istanbul and Stuttgart, Oslo and Edinburgh.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 19 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The itinerary includes explicit entries for flight days, ensuring that the transition between cities is correctly represented."
