Helen will be at North Beach from 7:00AM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Kimberly will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:30PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 45 minutes. Patricia will be at Bayview from 6:00PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
