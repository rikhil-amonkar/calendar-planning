Emily will be at Alamo Square from 11:45AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 105 minutes. Barbara will be at Union Square from 4:45PM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 60 minutes. William will be at Chinatown from 5:15PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
