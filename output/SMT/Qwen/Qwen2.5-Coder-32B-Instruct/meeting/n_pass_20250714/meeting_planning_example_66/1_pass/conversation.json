Robert will be at Presidio from 11:15AM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Create a solver instance\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Define time variables in minutes since 9:00 AM\nleave_nob_hill = Int('leave_nob_hill')\narrive_presidio = Int('arrive_presidio')\nleave_presidio = Int('leave_presidio')\narrive_nob_hill = Int('arrive_nob_hill')\n\n# Constraints\n# You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM (0 minutes)\nsolver.add(leave_nob_hill >= 0)\n\n# Travel time from Nob Hill to Presidio is 17 minutes\nsolver.add(arrive_presidio == leave_nob_hill + 17)\n\n# Robert is available from 11:15 AM to 5:45 PM\n# 11:15 AM is 135 minutes after 9:00 AM\n# 5:45 PM is 465 minutes after 9:00 AM\nsolver.add(arrive_presidio >= 135)\nsolver.add(leave_presidio <= 465)\n\n# You need to meet Robert for at least 120 minutes\nsolver.add(leave_presidio - arrive_presidio >= 120)\n\n# Travel time from Presidio to Nob Hill is 18 minutes\nsolver.add(arrive_nob_hill == leave_presidio + 18)\n\n# Objective: Minimize the total time spent traveling and meeting Robert\n# Since we don't have a specific end time, we can just find a feasible schedule\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    leave_nob_hill_time = model[leave_nob_hill].as_long()\n    arrive_presidio_time = model[arrive_presidio].as_long()\n    leave_presidio_time = model[leave_presidio].as_long()\n    arrive_nob_hill_time = model[arrive_nob_hill].as_long()\n\n    print(f\"Leave Nob Hill at: {leave_nob_hill_time} minutes past 9:00 AM\")\n    print(f\"Arrive Presidio at: {arrive_presidio_time} minutes past 9:00 AM\")\n    print(f\"Leave Presidio at: {leave_presidio_time} minutes past 9:00 AM\")\n    print(f\"Arrive Nob Hill at: {arrive_nob_hill_time} minutes past 9:00 AM\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up the constraints and uses the Z3 solver to find a feasible schedule that meets all the requirements. The output will give you the times you should leave and arrive at each location to meet Robert for at least 120 minutes within his availability."
