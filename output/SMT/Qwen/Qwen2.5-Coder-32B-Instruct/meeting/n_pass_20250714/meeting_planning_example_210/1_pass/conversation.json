Emily will be at Presidio from 4:15PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 105 minutes. Joseph will be at Richmond District from 5:15PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 120 minutes. Melissa will be at Financial District from 3:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
