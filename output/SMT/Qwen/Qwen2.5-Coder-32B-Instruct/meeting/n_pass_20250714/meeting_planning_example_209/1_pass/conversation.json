Anthony will be at Chinatown from 1:15PM to 2:30PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 60 minutes. Rebecca will be at Russian Hill from 7:30PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 105 minutes. Melissa will be at North Beach from 8:15AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

We'll define variables for the times we arrive at each location and ensure they respect the travel times and availability windows of our friends.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the time variables for arriving at each location\nt_sunset = Int('t_sunset')\nt_chinatown = Int('t_chinatown')\nt_russian_hill = Int('t_russian_hill')\nt_north_beach = Int('t_north_beach')\n\n# Define the solver\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Initial constraint: you arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM (540 minutes after midnight)\nsolver.add(t_sunset == 540)\n\n# Travel time constraints\nsolver.add(t_chinatown >= t_sunset + 30)  # Sunset District to Chinatown\nsolver.add(t_russian_hill >= t_sunset + 24)  # Sunset District to Russian Hill\nsolver.add(t_north_beach >= t_sunset + 29)  # Sunset District to North Beach\n\nsolver.add(t_sunset >= t_chinatown + 29)  # Chinatown to Sunset District\nsolver.add(t_russian_hill >= t_chinatown + 7)  # Chinatown to Russian Hill\nsolver.add(t_north_beach >= t_chinatown + 3)  # Chinatown to North Beach\n\nsolver.add(t_sunset >= t_russian_hill + 23)  # Russian Hill to Sunset District\nsolver.add(t_chinatown >= t_russian_hill + 9)  # Russian Hill to Chinatown\nsolver.add(t_north_beach >= t_russian_hill + 5)  # Russian Hill to North Beach\n\nsolver.add(t_sunset >= t_north_beach + 27)  # North Beach to Sunset District\nsolver.add(t_chinatown >= t_north_beach + 6)  # North Beach to Chinatown\nsolver.add(t_russian_hill >= t_north_beach + 4)  # North Beach to Russian Hill\n\n# Availability constraints for friends\n# Anthony: 1:15PM to 2:30PM (795 to 930 minutes after midnight), meet for at least 60 minutes\nsolver.add(Or(t_chinatown < 795, t_chinatown + 60 > 930))\n\n# Rebecca: 7:30PM to 9:15PM (1230 to 1395 minutes after midnight), meet for at least 105 minutes\nsolver.add(Or(t_russian_hill < 1230, t_russian_hill + 105 > 1395))\n\n# Melissa: 8:15AM to 1:30PM (495 to 810 minutes after midnight), meet for at least 105 minutes\nsolver.add(Or(t_north_beach < 495, t_north_beach + 105 > 810))\n\n# Check if the constraints are satisfiable\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n    print(f\"Arrive at Sunset District: {model[t_sunset]} minutes after midnight (9:00AM)\")\n    print(f\"Arrive at Chinatown: {model[t_chinatown]} minutes after midnight ({model[t_chinatown] // 60}:{model[t_chinatown] % 60:02d}AM/PM)\")\n    print(f\"Arrive at Russian Hill: {model[t_russian_hill]} minutes after midnight ({model[t_russian_hill] // 60}:{model[t_russian_hill] % 60:02d}AM/PM)\")\n    print(f\"Arrive at North Beach: {model[t_north_beach]} minutes after midnight ({model[t_north_beach] // 60}:{model[t_north_beach] % 60:02d}AM/PM)\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up the problem using the Z3 solver, defines the constraints based on the given travel times and friend availability, and checks for a feasible schedule. If a solution is found, it prints the arrival times at each location."
