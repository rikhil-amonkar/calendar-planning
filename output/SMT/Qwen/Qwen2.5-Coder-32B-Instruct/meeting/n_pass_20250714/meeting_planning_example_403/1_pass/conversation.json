Andrew will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:45AM to 2:30PM. You'd like to meet Andrew for a minimum of 75 minutes. Sarah will be at Pacific Heights from 4:15PM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 15 minutes. Nancy will be at Presidio from 5:30PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 60 minutes. Rebecca will be at Chinatown from 9:45AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 90 minutes. Robert will be at The Castro from 8:30AM to 2:15PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
