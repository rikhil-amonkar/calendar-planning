David will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 10:45AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 15 minutes. Timothy will be at Pacific Heights from 9:00AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Timothy for a minimum of 75 minutes. Robert will be at Mission District from 12:15PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
