Barbara will be at North Beach from 1:45PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 60 minutes. Margaret will be at Presidio from 10:15AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 30 minutes. Kevin will be at Haight-Ashbury from 8:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 30 minutes. Kimberly will be at Union Square from 7:45AM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
