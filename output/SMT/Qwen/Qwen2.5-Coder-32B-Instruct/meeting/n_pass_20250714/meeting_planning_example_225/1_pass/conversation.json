Sarah will be at North Beach from 4:00PM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 60 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Union Square from 3:00PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 75 minutes. Brian will be at Alamo Square from 4:00PM to 5:30PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
