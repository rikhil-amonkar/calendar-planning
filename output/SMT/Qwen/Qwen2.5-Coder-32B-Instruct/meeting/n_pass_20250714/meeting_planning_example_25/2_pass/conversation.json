The main goal is to visit as many friends as possible while ensuring that you meet David for at least 105 minutes. Given the constraints, let's assume there are no other friends to visit except David, since no other friends or locations are specified. \n\nWe will model the time in minutes starting from 9:00 AM, which we'll consider as minute 0.
