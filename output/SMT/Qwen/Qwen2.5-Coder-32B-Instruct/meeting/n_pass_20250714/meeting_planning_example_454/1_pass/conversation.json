Jessica will be at Golden Gate Park from 1:45PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 30 minutes. Ashley will be at Bayview from 5:15PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 105 minutes. Ronald will be at Chinatown from 7:15AM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 90 minutes. William will be at North Beach from 1:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 15 minutes. Daniel will be at Mission District from 7:00AM to 11:15AM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The goal is to maximize the number of friends met while respecting the time constraints and travel times between locations.\n\nHere's the Python program that uses Z3 to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the locations\nlocations = ['Presidio', 'Golden Gate Park', 'Bayview', 'Chinatown', 'North Beach', 'Mission District']\n\n# Define the travel times (in minutes)\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Presidio', 'Golden Gate Park'): 12,\n    ('Presidio', 'Bayview'): 31,\n    ('Presidio', 'Chinatown'): 21,\n    ('Presidio', 'North Beach'): 18,\n    ('Presidio', 'Mission District'): 26,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Presidio'): 11,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Bayview'): 23,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Chinatown'): 23,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'North Beach'): 24,\n    ('Golden Gate Park', 'Mission District'): 17,\n    ('Bayview', 'Presidio'): 31,\n    ('Bayview', 'Golden Gate Park'): 22,\n    ('Bayview', 'Chinatown'): 18,\n    ('Bayview', 'North Beach'): 21,\n    ('Bayview', 'Mission District'): 13,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Presidio'): 19,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Golden Gate Park'): 23,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Bayview'): 22,\n    ('Chinatown', 'North Beach'): 3,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Mission District'): 18,\n    ('North Beach', 'Presidio'): 17,\n    ('North Beach', 'Golden Gate Park'): 22,\n    ('North Beach', 'Bayview'): 22,\n    ('North Beach', 'Chinatown'): 6,\n    ('North Beach', 'Mission District'): 18,\n    ('Mission District', 'Presidio'): 25,\n    ('Mission District', 'Golden Gate Park'): 17,\n    ('Mission District', 'Bayview'): 15,\n    ('Mission District', 'Chinatown'): 16,\n    ('Mission District', 'North Beach'): 17,\n}\n\n# Define the friends and their availability\nfriends = {\n    'Jessica': {'location': 'Golden Gate Park', 'start': 16.75, 'end': 18.0, 'min_duration': 0.5},\n    'Ashley': {'location': 'Bayview', 'start': 17.25, 'end': 20.0, 'min_duration': 1.75},\n    'Ronald': {'location': 'Chinatown', 'start': 7.25, 'end': 14.75, 'min_duration': 1.5},\n    'William': {'location': 'North Beach', 'start': 13.25, 'end': 20.25, 'min_duration': 0.25},\n    'Daniel': {'location': 'Mission District', 'start': 7.0, 'end': 11.25, 'min_duration': 1.75},\n}\n\n# Create a solver instance\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Define variables\ncurrent_time = Real('current_time')\nvisited = {friend: Bool(f'visited_{friend}') for friend in friends}\narrival_times = {location: Real(f'arrival_{location}') for location in locations}\n\n# Initial conditions\nsolver.add(arrival_times['Presidio'] == 9.0)\n\n# Add constraints for each friend\nfor friend, details in friends.items():\n    loc = details['location']\n    start = details['start']\n    end = details['end']\n    min_duration = details['min_duration']\n    \n    # Constraint to visit the friend within their available time\n    solver.add(Implies(visited[friend], arrival_times[loc] + min_duration <= end))\n    solver.add(Implies(visited[friend], arrival_times[loc] >= start))\n    \n    # Constraint to ensure the time spent traveling is respected\n    for prev_loc in locations:\n        if prev_loc != loc:\n            solver.add(Implies(visited[friend], arrival_times[loc] >= arrival_times[prev_loc] + travel_times[(prev_loc, loc)] / 60.0))\n\n# Objective: Maximize the number of friends visited\nobjective = Sum([If(visited[friend], 1, 0) for friend in friends])\nsolver.maximize(objective)\n\n# Check if the constraints can be satisfied\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n    print(f\"Start at Presidio at 9:00 AM\")\n    for friend, details in friends.items():\n        if model.evaluate(visited[friend]):\n            loc = details['location']\n            start_time = model.evaluate(arrival_times[loc]).as_decimal(3)\n            end_time = model.evaluate(arrival_times[loc] + details['min_duration']).as_decimal(3)\n            print(f\"Meet {friend} at {loc} from {start_time} to {end_time}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up the problem using Z3, defining the constraints for meeting each friend within their available time and respecting travel times. It then maximizes the number of friends met. The output will show the optimal schedule based on these constraints."
