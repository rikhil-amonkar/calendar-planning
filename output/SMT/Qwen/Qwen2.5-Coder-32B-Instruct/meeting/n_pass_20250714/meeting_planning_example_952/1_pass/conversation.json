friend's availability and meeting duration, and maximizes the number of friends you can meet within the constraints. The solution will print out the optimal schedule for meeting your friends. Note that the `availability[\"location\"]` should be set for each friend in the `friends_availability` dictionary if they are located at specific places other than their names. In this case, I assumed the names correspond to the locations. Adjust accordingly if needed."
