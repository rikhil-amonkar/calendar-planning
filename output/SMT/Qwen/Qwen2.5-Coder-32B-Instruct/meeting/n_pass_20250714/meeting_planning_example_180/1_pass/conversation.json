James will be at Mission District from 12:45PM to 2:00PM. You'd like to meet James for a minimum of 75 minutes. Robert will be at The Castro from 12:45PM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the solver\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Define the time variables for arriving at each location\nt_nb = Int('t_nb')  # Time arriving at North Beach\nt_md = Int('t_md')  # Time arriving at Mission District\nt_c = Int('t_c')    # Time arriving at The Castro\n\n# Initial constraint: You arrive at North Beach at 9:00 AM (540 minutes after midnight)\nsolver.add(t_nb == 540)\n\n# Constraints for meeting James in the Mission District from 12:45 PM to 2:00 PM (765 to 1200 minutes after midnight)\n# Minimum 75 minutes meeting time\nsolver.add(And(t_md >= 765, t_md + 75 <= 1200))\n\n# Constraints for meeting Robert in The Castro from 12:45 PM to 3:15 PM (765 to 1890 minutes after midnight)\n# Minimum 30 minutes meeting time\nsolver.add(And(t_c >= 765, t_c + 30 <= 1890))\n\n# Travel time constraints\n# North Beach to Mission District: 18 minutes\nsolver.add(t_md - t_nb >= 18)\n# North Beach to The Castro: 22 minutes\nsolver.add(t_c - t_nb >= 22)\n# Mission District to North Beach: 17 minutes\nsolver.add(t_nb - t_md >= 17)\n# Mission District to The Castro: 7 minutes\nsolver.add(t_c - t_md >= 7)\n# The Castro to North Beach: 20 minutes\nsolver.add(t_nb - t_c >= 20)\n# The Castro to Mission District: 7 minutes\nsolver.add(t_md - t_c >= 7)\n\n# Check if the constraints are satisfiable\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n    print(f\"Arrive at North Beach at: {model[t_nb]} minutes (9:00 AM)\")\n    print(f\"Arrive at Mission District at: {model[t_md]} minutes ({model[t_md] // 60}:{model[t_md] % 60:02d} AM/PM)\")\n    print(f\"Arrive at The Castro at: {model[t_c]} minutes ({model[t_c] // 60}:{model[t_c] % 60:02d} AM/PM)\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis program sets up the constraints and uses the Z3 solver to find a feasible schedule that meets all the requirements. The output will show the optimal arrival times at each location to maximize the number of friends you can meet within their availability windows."
