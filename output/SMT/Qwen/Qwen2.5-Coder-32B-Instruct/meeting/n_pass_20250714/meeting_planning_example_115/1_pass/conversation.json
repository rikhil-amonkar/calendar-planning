Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nRichmond District to Pacific Heights: 10.\nRichmond District to Marina District: 9.\nPacific Heights to Richmond District: 12.\nPacific Heights to Marina District: 6.\nMarina District to Richmond District: 11.\nMarina District to Pacific Heights: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Richmond District at 9:00AM. Jessica will be at Pacific Heights from 3:30PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 45 minutes. Carol will be at Marina District from 11:30AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The `Optimize` class is used to maximize the number of friends met, which is represented by soft constraints."
