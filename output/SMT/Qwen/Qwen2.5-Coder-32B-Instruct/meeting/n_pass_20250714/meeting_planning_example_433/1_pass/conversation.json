You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 75 minutes. Ronald will be at North Beach from 6:30PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 45 minutes. Deborah will be at The Castro from 1:45PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:15AM to 2:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
