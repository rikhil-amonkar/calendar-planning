        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem using the Z3 solver, we need to define the constraints and the objective function. The main goal is to maximize the number of friends met while ensuring the meeting with Kenneth meets the duration requirement.\n\nHere's how you can model this problem in Python using the Z3 solver:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the time variables for each activity\nstart_meeting_kenneth = Int('start_meeting_kenneth')\nend_meeting_kenneth = Int('end_meeting_kenneth')\n\n# Constraints\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# You arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM\narrival_time = 9 * 60  # Convert 9:00 AM to minutes\n\n# Kenneth will be at Nob Hill from 2:15 PM to 7:45 PM\nkenneth_start = 14 * 60 + 15  # Convert 2:15 PM to minutes\nkenneth_end = 19 * 60 + 45    # Convert 7:45 PM to minutes\n\n# Meeting Kenneth for a minimum of 90 minutes\nsolver.add(end_meeting_kenneth - start_meeting_kenneth >= 90)\n\n# Meeting time must be within Kenneth's availability\nsolver.add(start_meeting_kenneth >= kenneth_start)\nsolver.add(end_meeting_kenneth <= kenneth_end)\n\n# Travel time between Fisherman's Wharf and Nob Hill is 11 minutes\ntravel_time = 11\n\n# Ensure you have enough time to travel to Nob Hill and back\n# Assuming you want to start meeting Kenneth as early as possible after arrival\n# and return to Fisherman's Wharf by the end of the day (let's assume 11:59 PM)\nday_end = 23 * 60 + 59  # Convert 11:59 PM to minutes\n\n# Constraint to ensure you can travel to Nob Hill, meet Kenneth, and return\nsolver.add(start_meeting_kenneth >= arrival_time + travel_time)\nsolver.add(end_meeting_kenneth + travel_time <= day_end)\n\n# Objective: Maximize the number of friends met\n# For simplicity, let's assume you can meet other friends only when not meeting Kenneth\n# and you can meet one friend per hour (60 minutes) excluding travel time\n\n# Define a variable for the number of friends met\nnum_friends_met = Int('num_friends_met')\n\n# Calculate the available time to meet other friends\navailable_time = (end_meeting_kenneth - start_meeting_kenneth) - 90  # Time spent with Kenneth minus 90 minutes\navailable_time += (start_meeting_kenneth - arrival_time - travel_time)  # Time before meeting Kenneth\navailable_time += (day_end - end_meeting_kenneth - travel_time)  # Time after meeting Kenneth\n\n# You can meet one friend per hour (60 minutes)\nsolver.add(num_friends_met == available_time // 60)\n\n# Maximize the number of friends met\nsolver.maximize(num_friends_met)\n\n# Check if the constraints are satisfiable and get the model\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n    print(f\"Start meeting Kenneth at: {model[start_meeting_kenneth].as_long() // 60}:{model[start_meeting_kenneth].as_long() % 60:02d}\")\n    print(f\"End meeting Kenneth at: {model[end_meeting_kenneth].as_long() // 60}:{model[end_meeting_kenneth].as_long() % 60:02d}\")\n    print(f\"Number of friends met: {model[num_friends_met]}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up the problem with the given constraints and uses the Z3 solver to find the optimal schedule that maximizes the number of friends met while ensuring the meeting with Kenneth lasts at least 90 minutes."
