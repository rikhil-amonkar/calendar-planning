Melissa will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:30AM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 15 minutes. Nancy will be at Presidio from 7:45PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 105 minutes. Emily will be at Richmond District from 4:45PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The solution prints out the optimal times and locations for meeting each friend within the given constraints.

Adjustments may be needed based on specific travel paths and preferences."
