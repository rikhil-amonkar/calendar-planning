The main goal is to meet Barbara for at least 60 minutes, given the travel time between locations and the time window during which Barbara is available.\n\nHere's how you can model and solve this problem using Z3:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the variables\nstart_meeting = Int('start_meeting')  # Start time of meeting with Barbara in minutes from 9:00 AM\n\n# Constraints\n# Barbara is available from 7:15 AM to 10:00 PM, which is 135 to 1440 minutes from 00:00 AM\nbarbara_start = 135  # 7:15 AM in minutes from 00:00 AM\nbarbara_end = 1440   # 10:00 PM in minutes from 00:00 AM\n\n# You arrive at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM, which is 540 minutes from 00:00 AM\narrival_time = 540  # 9:00 AM in minutes from 00:00 AM\n\n# Travel time from Russian Hill to Pacific Heights is 7 minutes\ntravel_time = 7\n\n# Meeting duration should be at least 60 minutes\nmeeting_duration = 60\n\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = [\n    start_meeting >= arrival_time + travel_time,  # You must reach Pacific Heights before starting the meeting\n    start_meeting + meeting_duration <= barbara_end,  # Meeting should end before Barbara leaves\n    start_meeting >= barbara_start,  # Meeting should start after Barbara arrives\n]\n\n# Create the solver\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Add the constraints to the solver\nsolver.add(constraints)\n\n# Check if there is a solution\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    start_time_minutes = model[start_meeting].as_long()\n    start_time_hours = start_time_minutes // 60\n    start_time_minutes = start_time_minutes % 60\n    print(f\"SOLUTION: You should start meeting Barbara at {start_time_hours:02}:{start_time_minutes:02} AM.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"SOLUTION: It is not possible to meet Barbara for at least 60 minutes within the given constraints.\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up the problem with the given constraints and uses the Z3 solver to find a valid schedule. It calculates the earliest time you can start meeting Barbara while ensuring the meeting lasts at least 60 minutes and fits within her availability."
