David will be at Mission District from 8:00AM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 45 minutes. Kenneth will be at Alamo Square from 2:00PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 120 minutes. John will be at Pacific Heights from 5:00PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet John for a minimum of 15 minutes. Charles will be at Union Square from 9:45PM to 10:45PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 60 minutes. Deborah will be at Golden Gate Park from 7:00AM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 90 minutes. Karen will be at Sunset District from 5:45PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 15 minutes. Carol will be at Presidio from 8:15AM to 9:15AM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
