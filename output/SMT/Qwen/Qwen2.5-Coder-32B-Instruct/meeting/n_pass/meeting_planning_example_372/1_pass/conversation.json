Charles will be at Alamo Square from 6:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 90 minutes. Margaret will be at Russian Hill from 9:00AM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 30 minutes. Daniel will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:00AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 15 minutes. Stephanie will be at Mission District from 8:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
