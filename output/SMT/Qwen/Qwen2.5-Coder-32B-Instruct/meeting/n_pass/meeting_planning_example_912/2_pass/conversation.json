constrained to be exactly 7.\n   - The travel time and meeting duration are added to the current time to ensure the next meeting is feasible.\n4. **Solver**: The solver checks if the constraints can be satisfied and prints the list of friends met if a solution is found.\n\nThis revised code should correctly handle the constraints and ensure that exactly 7 friends are met."
