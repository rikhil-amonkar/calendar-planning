Jessica will be at Embarcadero from 4:45PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 30 minutes. Sandra will be at Richmond District from 6:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 120 minutes. Jason will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:00PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
