Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Robert at Fisherman's Wharf (29 minutes): Arrive at 9:29 AM.\n3. Meet Robert from 9:29 AM to 10:19 AM (30 minutes).\n4. Travel to Michelle at Chinatown (12 minutes): Arrive at 10:31 AM.\n5. Meet Michelle from 10:31 AM to 10:46 AM (15 minutes).\n6. Travel to George at Presidio (21 minutes): Arrive at 11:02 AM.\n7. Meet George from 11:02 AM to 11:32 AM (30 minutes).\n8. Travel to William at Russian Hill (14 minutes): Arrive at 11:46 AM.\n9. Meet William from 6:30 PM to 8:45 PM (105 minutes).\n\nThis manual schedule seems feasible, but the travel times and meeting durations need to be respected. Let's adjust the code to reflect this manual schedule and check if it works.\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the locations\nlocations = ['Sunset District', 'Russian Hill', 'Chinatown', 'Presidio', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf']\n\n# Define the travel times\ntravel_times = {\n    ('Sunset District', 'Russian Hill'): 24,\n    ('Sunset District', 'Chinatown'): 30,\n    ('Sunset District', 'Presidio'): 16,\n    ('Sunset District', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 29,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Sunset District'): 23,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Chinatown'): 9,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Presidio'): 14,\n    ('Russian Hill', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 7,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Sunset District'): 29,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Russian Hill'): 7,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Presidio'): 19,\n    ('Chinatown', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 8,\n    ('Presidio', 'Sunset District'): 15,\n    ('Presidio', 'Russian Hill'): 14,\n    ('Presidio', 'Chinatown'): 21,\n    ('Presidio', 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf'): 19,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Sunset District'): 27,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Russian Hill'): 7,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Chinatown'): 12,\n    ('Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'Presidio'): 17\n}\n\n# Define the friends' availability and meeting times\nfriends_availability = {\n    'William': {'location': 'Russian Hill', 'start': 18*60 + 30, 'end': 20*60 + 45, 'min_meeting_time': 105},\n    'Michelle': {'location': 'Chinatown', 'start': 8*60 + 15, 'end': 14*60, 'min_meeting_time': 15},\n    'George': {'location': 'Presidio', 'start': 10*60 + 30, 'end': 18*60 + 45, 'min_meeting_time': 30},\n    'Robert': {'location': 'Fisherman\\'s Wharf', 'start': 9*60, 'end': 13*60 + 45, 'min_meeting_time': 30}\n}\n\n# Create a solver instance\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Define variables for the start time at each location\nstart_times = {loc: Int(f'start_{loc}') for loc in locations}\n\n# Define boolean variables for meeting each friend\nmeet_william = Bool('meet_william')\nmeet_michelle = Bool('meet_michelle')\nmeet_george = Bool('meet_george')\nmeet_robert = Bool('meet_robert')\n\n# Add constraint for starting at Sunset District at 9:00 AM\nsolver.add(start_times['Sunset District'] == 9*60)\n\n# Add constraints for travel times\nfor (loc1, loc2), time in travel_times.items():\n    solver.add(start_times[loc2] >= start_times[loc1] + time)\n\n# Add constraints for meeting friends\ndef add_meeting_constraints(friend, info, meet_var):\n    loc = info['location']\n    start = info['start']\n    end = info['end']\n    min_meeting_time = info['min_meeting_time']\n    # Ensure we arrive at the location before the friend leaves and leave after the friend arrives\n    solver.add(Implies(meet_var, start_times[loc] <= end - min_meeting_time))\n    solver.add(Implies(meet_var, start_times[loc] + min_meeting_time >= start))\n\nadd_meeting_constraints('William', friends_availability['William'], meet_william)\nadd_meeting_constraints('Michelle', friends_availability['Michelle'], meet_michelle)\nadd_meeting_constraints('George', friends_availability['George'], meet_george)\nadd_meeting_constraints('Robert', friends_availability['Robert'], meet_robert)\n\n# Ensure we meet exactly 4 people\nsolver.add(meet_william + meet_michelle + meet_george + meet_robert == 4)\n\n# Manually set the schedule based on the manual plan\nmanual_schedule = {\n    'Robert': 9*60 + 29,  # 9:29 AM\n    'Michelle': 10*60 + 31,  # 10:31 AM\n    'George': 11*60 + 2,  # 11:02 AM\n    'William': 18*60 + 30  # 6:30 PM\n}\n\n# Add constraints for the manual schedule\nsolver.add(start_times['Fisherman\\'s Wharf'] == manual_schedule['Robert'])\nsolver.add(start_times['Chinatown'] == manual_schedule['Michelle'])\nsolver.add(start_times['Presidio'] == manual_schedule['George'])\nsolver.add(start_times['Russian Hill'] == manual_schedule['William'])\n\n# Check if the constraints are satisfiable\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    schedule = {loc: model[start_times[loc]].as_long() for loc in locations}\n    print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n    for loc, time in sorted(schedule.items()):\n        print(f\"{loc}: {time // 60}:{time % 60:02}\")\n    print(\"Meetings:\")\n    if model[meet_william]:\n        print(\"William at Russian Hill\")\n    if model[meet_michelle]:\n        print(\"Michelle at Chinatown\")\n    if model[meet_george]:\n        print(\"George at Presidio\")\n    if model[meet_robert]:\n        print(\"Robert at Fisherman's Wharf\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n```output\nNo solution found\n```\nGiven that the solver still cannot find a feasible solution, it indicates that the constraints are indeed too restrictive, and it might be impossible to meet all four friends within the given time frame and travel times. Let's manually verify the constraints and see if there's any way to adjust the schedule to make it feasible.\n\n### Manual Verification\n\n1. **Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM**.\n2. **Meet Robert at Fisherman's Wharf**:\n   - Travel time: 29 minutes.\n   - Arrive at 9:29 AM.\n   - Meet Robert from 9:29 AM to 10:19 AM (30 minutes).\n3. **Meet Michelle at Chinatown**:\n   - Travel time: 12 minutes.\n   - Arrive at 10:31 AM.\n   - Meet Michelle from 10:31 AM to 10:46 AM (15 minutes).\n4. **Meet George at Presidio**:\n   - Travel time: 21 minutes.\n   - Arrive at 11:02 AM.\n   - Meet George from 11:02 AM to 11:32 AM (30 minutes).\n5. **Meet William at Russian Hill**:\n   - Travel time: 14 minutes.\n   - Arrive at 11:46 AM.\n   - Need to meet William from 6:30 PM to 8:45 PM (105 minutes).\n\nThe issue arises because the travel time to Russian Hill from Presidio is 14 minutes, and arriving at 11:46 AM means we would need to wait until 6:30 PM to meet William, which is not feasible given the travel times and the need to meet all friends within a single day.\n\n### Adjusting the Schedule\n\nGiven the constraints, let's try a different approach:\n\n1. **Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM**.\n2. **Meet Michelle at Chinatown**:\n   - Travel time: 30 minutes.\n   - Arrive at 9:30 AM.\n   - Meet Michelle from 9:30 AM to 9:45 AM (15 minutes).\n3. **Meet Robert at Fisherman's Wharf**:\n   - Travel time: 29 minutes.\n   - Arrive at 10:04 AM.\n   - Meet Robert from 10:04 AM to 10:34 AM (30 minutes).\n4. **Meet George at Presidio**:\n   - Travel time: 19 minutes.\n   - Arrive at 10:23 AM.\n   - Meet George from 10:23 AM to 10:53 AM (30 minutes).\n5. **Meet William at Russian Hill**:\n   - Travel time: 14 minutes.\n   - Arrive at 10:37 AM.\n   - Need to meet William from 6:30 PM to 8:45 PM (105 minutes).\n\nThis adjusted schedule still doesn't work because we would need to wait until 6:30 PM to meet William, which is not feasible given the travel times and the need to meet all friends within a single day.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the constraints and the travel times, it seems that it is not possible to meet all four friends within a single day. The travel times and meeting durations are too restrictive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there is no feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No solution found}}\n\\]"
