The main goal is to maximize the number of friends met while ensuring that the meeting with Joshua meets the duration requirement. Since the problem statement does not specify other friends or their availability, we'll focus on the constraint related to Joshua.\n\nHere's how you can set up the problem in Python using the Z3 solver:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the solver\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Define the time variables for the visit to Golden Gate Park\nstart_time_joshua_meeting = Int('start_time_joshua_meeting')\n\n# Constraints\n# You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00 AM, which is 540 minutes after midnight\narrival_time = 540\n\n# Joshua is available from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM, which is 1245 to 1305 minutes after midnight\njoshua_start = 1245\njoshua_end = 1305\n\n# You need to meet Joshua for at least 15 minutes\nmin_meeting_duration = 15\n\n# Constraint: Meeting with Joshua must start within his availability window\nsolver.add(start_time_joshua_meeting >= joshua_start)\nsolver.add(start_time_joshua_meeting + min_meeting_duration <= joshua_end)\n\n# Objective: Maximize the number of friends met. Since no other friends are specified,\n# we just need to ensure the meeting with Joshua happens as per the constraints.\n\n# Check if the constraints are satisfiable\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    start_time = model.evaluate(start_time_joshua_meeting).as_long()\n    print(f\"SOLUTION: Meet Joshua starting at {start_time} minutes after midnight.\")\n    print(f\"Meeting duration: {min_meeting_duration} minutes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"SOLUTION: No feasible schedule found to meet Joshua for at least 15 minutes.\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up the problem with the given constraints and checks if there is a feasible schedule to meet Joshua for at least 15 minutes within his availability window. Since no other friends are mentioned, the primary focus is on satisfying the Joshua meeting constraint. If additional friends and their availability were provided, we could extend this model to include them and optimize the schedule accordingly."
