Kenneth will be at Chinatown from 12:00PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 90 minutes. Barbara will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:15AM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The goal is to maximize the number of friends met while respecting the time constraints and travel times.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the solver\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Define the time variables for each location visit\nt_chinatown_start = Int('t_chinatown_start')\nt_chinatown_end = Int('t_chinatown_end')\nt_golden_gate_park_start = Int('t_golden_gate_park_start')\nt_golden_gate_park_end = Int('t_golden_gate_park_end')\n\n# Constraints for arrival and departure times\nsolver.add(t_chinatown_start >= 12 * 60)  # 12:00 PM in minutes\nsolver.add(t_chinatown_end <= 15 * 60)    # 3:00 PM in minutes\nsolver.add(t_chinatown_end - t_chinatown_start >= 90)  # Minimum 90 minutes with Kenneth\n\nsolver.add(t_golden_gate_park_start >= 8 * 60 + 15)  # 8:15 AM in minutes\nsolver.add(t_golden_gate_park_end <= 19 * 60)        # 7:00 PM in minutes\nsolver.add(t_golden_gate_park_end - t_golden_gate_park_start >= 45)  # Minimum 45 minutes with Barbara\n\n# Travel times in minutes\ntravel_fd_to_ch = 5\ntravel_ch_to_fd = 5\ntravel_fd_to_ggp = 23\ntravel_ggp_to_fd = 26\ntravel_ch_to_ggp = 23\ntravel_ggp_to_ch = 23\n\n# Start time at Financial District\nstart_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 AM in minutes\n\n# Add constraints for travel times\n# If visiting Chinatown first\nsolver.add(Or(\n    And(t_chinatown_start == start_time + travel_fd_to_ch,\n        t_golden_gate_park_start >= t_chinatown_end + travel_ch_to_ggp),\n    And(t_chinatown_start == start_time + travel_fd_to_ch,\n        t_golden_gate_park_start >= start_time + travel_fd_to_ggp)\n))\n\n# If visiting Golden Gate Park first\nsolver.add(Or(\n    And(t_golden_gate_park_start == start_time + travel_fd_to_ggp,\n        t_chinatown_start >= t_golden_gate_park_end + travel_ggp_to_ch),\n    And(t_golden_gate_park_start == start_time + travel_fd_to_ggp,\n        t_chinatown_start >= start_time + travel_fd_to_ch)\n))\n\n# Check if there is a solution\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n    print(f\"Meet Kenneth at Chinatown from {model[t_chinatown_start]} to {model[t_chinatown_end]}\")\n    print(f\"Meet Barbara at Golden Gate Park from {model[t_golden_gate_park_start]} to {model[t_golden_gate_park_end]}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up the constraints for meeting Kenneth and Barbara within their availability and ensures that the travel times between locations are respected. It then checks if there is a feasible schedule and prints the meeting times if a solution is found. Note that the logic for handling the order of visits (Chinatown first or Golden Gate Park first) could be more refined to ensure all possibilities are considered."
