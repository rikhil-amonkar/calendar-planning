We need to meet him for at least 60 minutes.\n   - If we arrive at Chinatown at 795 minutes (1:15PM), we can meet him until 855 minutes (1:55PM).\n   - If we arrive at Chinatown at 800 minutes (1:20PM), we can meet him until 860 minutes (2:00PM).\n   - If we arrive at Chinatown at 805 minutes (1:25PM), we can meet him until 865 minutes (2:05PM).\n   - If we arrive at Chinatown at 810 minutes (1:30PM), we can meet him until 870 minutes (2:10PM).\n   - If we arrive at Chinatown at 815 minutes (1:35PM), we can meet him until 875 minutes (2:15PM).\n   - If we arrive at Chinatown at 820 minutes (1:40PM), we can meet him until 880 minutes (2:20PM).\n   - If we arrive at Chinatown at 825 minutes (1:45PM), we can meet him until 885 minutes (2:25PM).\n   - If we arrive at Chinatown at 830 minutes (1:50PM), we can meet him until 890 minutes (2:30PM).\n\n3. **Rebecca**: Available from 7:30PM to 9:15PM (1230 to 1395 minutes after midnight). We need to meet her for at least 105 minutes.\n   - If we arrive at Russian Hill at 1230 minutes (7:30PM), we can meet her until 1335 minutes (8:35PM).\n   - If we arrive at Russian Hill at 1235 minutes (7:35PM), we can meet her until 1340 minutes (8:40PM).\n   - If we arrive at Russian Hill at 1240 minutes (7:40PM), we can meet her until 1345 minutes (8:45PM).\n   - If we arrive at Russian Hill at 1245 minutes (7:45PM), we can meet her until 1350 minutes (8:50PM).\n   - If we arrive at Russian Hill at 1250 minutes (7:50PM), we can meet her until 1355 minutes (8:55PM).\n   - If we arrive at Russian Hill at 1255 minutes (7:55PM), we can meet her until 1360 minutes (9:00PM).\n   - If we arrive at Russian Hill at 1260 minutes (8:00PM), we can meet her until 1365 minutes (9:05PM).\n   - If we arrive at Russian Hill at 1265 minutes (8:05PM), we can meet her until 1370 minutes (9:10PM).\n   - If we arrive at Russian Hill at 1270 minutes (8:10PM), we can meet her until 1375 minutes (9:15PM).\n\nGiven the travel times and the availability windows, it seems that meeting all three friends within their respective time windows and for the required durations is indeed challenging.

However, we can try to meet two friends and see if we can adjust the schedule to meet a third friend.\n\nLet's try to meet Melissa and Anthony first and see if we can fit Rebecca in:\n\n1. **Start at Sunset District at 9:00AM (540 minutes).**\n2. **Travel to North Beach (29 minutes): Arrive at 9:29AM (569 minutes).**\n   - Meet Melissa from 9:29AM to 10:34AM (569 to 634 minutes).\n3. **Travel to Chinatown (3 minutes): Arrive at 10:37AM (637 minutes).**\n   - Meet Anthony from 1:15PM to 2:30PM (795 to 930 minutes).\n\nNow, let's check if we can fit Rebecca in:\n\n4. **Travel to Russian Hill (5 minutes): Arrive at 2:35PM (875 minutes).**\n   - Not enough time to meet Rebecca (7:30PM to 9:15PM).\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that meeting all three friends is not feasible due to the constraints.
