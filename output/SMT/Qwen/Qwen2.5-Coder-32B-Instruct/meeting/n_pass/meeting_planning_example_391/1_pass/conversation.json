Kevin will be at Alamo Square from 8:15AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 75 minutes. Kimberly will be at Russian Hill from 8:45AM to 12:30PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 30 minutes. Joseph will be at Presidio from 6:30PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 45 minutes. Thomas will be at Financial District from 7:00PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Thomas for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
