You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Larry and Samuel for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nLarry's calendar is wide open the entire week.\nSamuel has meetings on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00; \n\nLarry would rather not meet on Wednesday. Samuel would like to avoid more meetings on Tuesday. The group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

`0 <= day <= 2` ensures the day is between Monday (0) and Wednesday (2).\n\n2. **Time Constraints**:\n   - `0 <= start_time <= 450` ensures the meeting starts between 9:00 and 16:30.\n   - `start_time + 30 <= 480` ensures the meeting ends before 17:00.\n\n3. **Samuel's Busy Times**:\n   - Monday: 10:30-11:00 (90-120 minutes), 12:00-12:30 (180-210 minutes), 13:00-15:00 (210-360 minutes), 15:30-16:30 (390-480 minutes)\n   - Tuesday: 9:00-12:00 (0-180 minutes), 14:00-15:30 (300-390 minutes), 16:30-17:00 (450-480 minutes)\n   -
