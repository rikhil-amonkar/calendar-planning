You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Julie, Sean and Lori for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJulie has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \nSean has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nLori is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

We'll create variables for the possible meeting times and add constraints based on the availability of Julie, Sean, and Lori. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the time slots as integers representing minutes from 9:00\nstart_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 AM\nend_time = 17 * 60   # 5:00 PM\nmeeting_duration = 60  # 1 hour\n\n# Define the meeting start time variable\nmeeting_start = Int('meeting_start')\n\n# Define the constraints for each person\njulie_busy = [9*60, 9*60+30, 11*60, 11*60+30, 12*60, 12*60+30, 13*60+30, 14*60, 16*60, 17*60]\nsean_busy = [9*60, 9*60+30, 13*60, 13*60+30, 15*60, 15*60+30, 16*60, 16*60+30]\nlori_busy = [10*60, 10*60+30, 11*60, 13*60, 15*60+30, 17*60]\n\n# Create a list of tuples for each person's busy times\nbusy_times = {\n    'julie': [(t, t + 30) for t in julie_busy],\n    'sean': [(t, t + 30) for t in sean_busy],\n    'lori': [(t, t + 30) for t in lori_busy]\n}\n\n# Create the solver\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Add constraint that the meeting must fit within the working hours\nsolver.add(meeting_start >= start_time)\nsolver.add(meeting_start + meeting_duration <= end_time)\n\n# Add constraints for each person's busy times\nfor person, times in busy_times.items():\n    for start, end in times:\n        solver.add(Or(meeting_start + meeting_duration <= start, meeting_start >= end))\n\n# Check if there is a solution\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    meeting_start_minutes = model[meeting_start].as_long()\n    meeting_start_time = f\"{meeting_start_minutes // 60}:{meeting_start_minutes % 60:02}\"\n    meeting_end_time = f\"{(meeting_start_minutes + meeting_duration) // 60}:{(meeting_start_minutes + meeting_duration) % 60:02}\"\n    print(f\"SOLUTION:\\nDay: Monday\\nStart Time: {meeting_start_time}\\nEnd Time: {meeting_end_time}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis script sets up the problem in Z3, defines the constraints based on the busy times of Julie, Sean, and Lori, and then checks for a valid meeting time. If a solution is found, it prints the day, start time, and end time in the required format."
