You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Denise, Angela and Natalie for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDenise has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nAngelahas no meetings the whole day.\nNatalie is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

Below is the Python code that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the variables\nday = String('day')\nstart_time = Int('start_time')\nend_time = Int('end_time')\n\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = [\n    # The meeting must be on Monday\n    day == \"Monday\",\n    \n    # The meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    end_time == start_time + 30,\n    \n    # Meeting time must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00)\n    start_time >= 9 * 60,\n    end_time <= 17 * 60,\n    \n    # Denise's unavailability\n    Or(start_time >= 12 * 60 + 30, end_time <= 12 * 60),\n    Or(start_time >= 16 * 60, end_time <= 15 * 60 + 30),\n    \n    # Angela is available all day, so no additional constraints for her\n    \n    # Natalie's unavailability\n    Or(start_time >= 11 * 60 + 30, end_time <= 9 * 60),\n    Or(start_time >= 13 * 60, end_time <= 12 * 60),\n    Or(start_time >= 14 * 30, end_time <= 14 * 60),\n    Or(start_time >= 17 * 60, end_time <= 15 * 60)\n]\n\n# Create a solver instance\nsolver = Solver()\nsolver.add(constraints)\n\n# Check if there is a solution\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    start_hour = model[start_time].as_long() // 60\n    start_minute = model[start_time].as_long() % 60\n    end_hour = model[end_time].as_long() // 60\n    end_minute = model[end_time].as_long() % 60\n    \n    print(f\"SOLUTION:\\nDay: {model[day]}\\nStart Time: {start_hour:02}:{start_minute:02}\\nEnd Time: {end_hour:02}:{end_minute:02}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code defines the constraints for the scheduling problem and uses the Z3 solver to find a feasible time slot. The constraints ensure that the meeting is scheduled within the working hours, does not overlap with any of the participants' unavailability periods, and lasts for 30 minutes. The solution is printed in the required format."
