You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Emily, Melissa and Frank for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nEmily has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMelissa is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nFrank has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFrank do not want to meet on Monday after 9:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem using the Z3 solver, we need to model the constraints and find a time slot that fits all participants' availability and preferences. Below is the Python code that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the variables for the meeting time\nday = String('day')\nstart_time = Int('start_time')\nend_time = Int('end_time')\n\n# Define the constraints\ns = Solver()\n\n# The meeting must be on Monday\ns.add(day == \"Monday\")\n\n# The meeting must be within work hours (9:00 to 17:00)\ns.add(start_time >= 9 * 60)  # 9:00 in minutes\ns.add(end_time <= 17 * 60)   # 17:00 in minutes\n\n# The meeting duration is 30 minutes\ns.add(end_time - start_time == 30)\n\n# Emily's busy times\nemily_busy_times = [(10 * 60, 10 * 60 + 30), (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60 + 30), (14 * 60, 15 * 60), (16 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)]\nfor start, end in emily_busy_times:\n    s.add(Or(start_time >= end, end_time <= start))\n\n# Melissa's busy times\nmelissa_busy_times = [(9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60), (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60)]\nfor start, end in melissa_busy_times:\n    s.add(Or(start_time >= end, end_time <= start))\n\n# Frank's busy times\nfrank_busy_times = [(10 * 60, 10 * 60 + 30), (11 * 60, 11 * 60 + 30), (12 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60 + 30), \n                    (13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60 + 30), (15 * 60, 16 * 60), (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)]\nfor start, end in frank_busy_times:\n    s.add(Or(start_time >= end, end_time <= start))\n\n# Frank does not want to meet after 9:30\ns.add(start_time <= 9 * 60 + 30)\n\n# Check if there is a solution\nif s.check() == sat:\n    m = s.model()\n    start_hour = m[start_time].as_long() // 60\n    start_minute = m[start_time].as_long() % 60\n    end_hour = m[end_time].as_long() // 60\n    end_minute = m[end_time].as_long() % 60\n    print(f\"SOLUTION:\\nDay: {m[day]}\\nStart Time: {start_hour:02}:{start_minute:02}\\nEnd Time: {end_hour:02}:{end_minute:02}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up the constraints using the Z3 solver, checks for a feasible solution, and prints the meeting time in the required format if a solution is found. The constraints ensure that the meeting time does not overlap with any busy periods of the participants and respects Frank's preference of not meeting after 9:30."
