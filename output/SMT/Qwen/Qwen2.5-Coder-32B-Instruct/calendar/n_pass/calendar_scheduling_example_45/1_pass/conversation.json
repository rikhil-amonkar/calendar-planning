You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Andrew, Grace and Samuel for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAndrew's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nGracehas no meetings the whole day.\nSamuel has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the variables for the start time of the meeting\nstart_time = Int('start_time')\n\n# Define the constraints for each participant's availability\nconstraints = [\n    # Andrew is available all day from 9:00 to 17:00\n    And(start_time >= 9*60, start_time + 30 <= 17*60),\n    \n    # Grace is also available all day from 9:00 to 17:00\n    And(start_time >= 9*60, start_time + 30 <= 17*60),\n    \n    # Samuel's unavailability blocks\n    Or(\n        start_time >= 10*60 + 30,  # Samuel is free after 10:30\n        And(start_time >= 12*60, start_time + 30 <= 13*60),  # Samuel is free from 12:00 to 13:00\n        And(start_time >= 13*60 + 30, start_time + 30 <= 14*60),  # Samuel is free from 13:30 to 14:00\n        And(start_time >= 16*60, start_time + 30 <= 16*60 + 30)  # Samuel is free from 16:00 to 16:30\n    )\n]\n\n# Create a solver instance\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Add all constraints to the solver\nfor constraint in constraints:\n    solver.add(constraint)\n\n# Check if there is a solution\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    start_minutes = model[start_time].as_long()\n    start_hour = start_minutes // 60\n    start_minute = start_minutes % 60\n    end_hour = (start_minutes + 30) // 60\n    end_minute = (start_minutes + 30) % 60\n    \n    # Format the output\n    print(f\"SOLUTION:\\nDay: Monday\\nStart Time: {start_hour:02}:{start_minute:02}\\nEnd Time: {end_hour:02}:{end_minute:02}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code uses the Z3 solver to find a valid time slot for the meeting that fits within everyone's availability. The constraints are defined based on the provided schedules, and the solution is printed in the required format."
