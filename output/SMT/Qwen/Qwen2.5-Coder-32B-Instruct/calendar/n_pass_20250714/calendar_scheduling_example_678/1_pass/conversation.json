You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Russell and Alexander for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nRussell is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, Tuesday during 13:00 to 13:30; \nAlexander has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nRussell would rather not meet on Tuesday before 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then adds constraints based on the busy times of Russell and Alexander and checks if there is a feasible solution. If a solution is found, it prints the day, start time, and end time of the meeting in the required format."
