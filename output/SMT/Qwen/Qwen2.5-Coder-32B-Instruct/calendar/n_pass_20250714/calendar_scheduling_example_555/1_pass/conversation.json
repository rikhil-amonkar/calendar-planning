You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Evelyn and Randy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nEvelynhas no meetings the whole day.\nRandy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nEvelyn do not want to meet on Monday after 13:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

Here is how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the time slots as integers representing minutes since 9:00 AM\nstart_of_day = 9 * 60  # 9:00 AM\nend_of_day = 17 * 60   # 17:00 PM\n\n# Define the meeting duration in minutes\nmeeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n# Define the variables for the start time of the meeting\nmeeting_start = Int('meeting_start')\n\n# Create a solver instance\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Constraints for Evelyn (no meetings all day)\n# No additional constraints needed for Evelyn as she is free all day\n\n# Constraints for Randy\n# Randy's blocked times are: 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00\nblocked_times_randy = [\n    (9 * 60, 10 * 60 + 30),  # 9:00 to 10:30\n    (11 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30), # 11:00 to 15:30\n    (16 * 60, 17 * 60)       # 16:00 to 17:00\n]\n\n# Add constraints to ensure the meeting does not overlap with Randy's blocked times\nfor start, end in blocked_times_randy:\n    solver.add(Or(meeting_start + meeting_duration <= start, meeting_start >= end))\n\n# Constraint for Evelyn's preference (do not meet after 13:00)\nsolver.add(meeting_start + meeting_duration <= 13 * 60)\n\n# Constraint to ensure the meeting is within work hours\nsolver.add(meeting_start >= start_of_day)\nsolver.add(meeting_start + meeting_duration <= end_of_day)\n\n# Check if there is a solution\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    meeting_start_minutes = model[meeting_start].as_long()\n    meeting_start_time = f\"{(meeting_start_minutes // 60):02}:{(meeting_start_minutes % 60):02}\"\n    meeting_end_time = f\"{((meeting_start_minutes + meeting_duration) // 60):02}:{((meeting_start_minutes + meeting_duration) % 60):02}\"\n    print(f\"SOLUTION:\\nDay: Monday\\nStart Time: {meeting_start_time}\\nEnd Time: {meeting_end_time}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up the problem using Z3, defines the constraints based on the participants' schedules and preferences, and then finds a valid meeting time that satisfies all conditions. The output will be in the specified format."
