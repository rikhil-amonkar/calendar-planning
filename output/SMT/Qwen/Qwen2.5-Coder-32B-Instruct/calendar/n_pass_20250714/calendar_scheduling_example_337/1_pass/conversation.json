You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for John, Megan, Brandon, Kimberly, Sean and Lori for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJohn has meetings on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30; \nMegan has meetings on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nBrandonhas no meetings the whole day.\nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nSean has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nLori has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

We will represent each person's availability as a set of intervals and then find a common interval that fits all participants.\n\nHere is the Python code using the Z3 solver to find a suitable meeting time:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the time intervals in minutes from 9:00 to 17:00\nstart_time = 9 * 60\nend_time = 17 * 60\nmeeting_duration = 30\n\n# Define the participants and their busy intervals\nparticipants = {\n    \"John\": [(11*60 + 30, 12*60), (14*60, 14*60 + 30)],\n    \"Megan\": [(12*60, 12*60 + 30), (14*60, 15*60), (15*60 + 30, 16*60)],\n    \"Brandon\": [],\n    \"Kimberly\": [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (10*60, 10*60 + 30), (11*60, 14*60 + 30), (15*60, 16*60), (16*60 + 30, 17*60)],\n    \"Sean\": [(10*60, 11*60), (11*60 + 30, 14*60), (15*60, 15*60 + 30)],\n    \"Lori\": [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (10*60 + 30, 12*60), (13*60, 14*60 + 30), (16*60, 16*60 + 30)]\n}\n\n# Create a solver instance\nsolver = Solver()\n\n# Define the start time of the meeting as a variable\nmeeting_start = Int('meeting_start')\n\n# Add constraints for the meeting to fit within the working hours and duration\nsolver.add(meeting_start >= start_time)\nsolver.add(meeting_start + meeting_duration <= end_time)\n\n# Add constraints for each participant's availability\nfor participant, busy_intervals in participants.items():\n    # The meeting should not overlap with any busy interval\n    for start, end in busy_intervals:\n        solver.add(Or(meeting_start + meeting_duration <= start, meeting_start >= end))\n\n# Check if there is a solution\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    meeting_start_value = model[meeting_start].as_long()\n    meeting_end_value = meeting_start_value + meeting_duration\n    \n    # Convert the times back to HH:MM format\n    start_hour = meeting_start_value // 60\n    start_minute = meeting_start_value % 60\n    end_hour = meeting_end_value // 60\n    end_minute = meeting_end_value % 60\n    \n    print(f\"SOLUTION:\\nDay: Monday\\nStart Time: {start_hour:02}:{start_minute:02}\\nEnd Time: {end_hour:02}:{end_minute:02}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code models the problem by defining the working hours and each participant's busy intervals. It uses Z3 to find a valid meeting time that does not overlap with any of the busy intervals and fits within the working hours. The solution is printed in the required format."
