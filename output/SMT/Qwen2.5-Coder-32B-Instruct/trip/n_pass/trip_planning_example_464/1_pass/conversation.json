You want to spend 5 days in Krakow. You plan to stay in Frankfurt for 4 days. You want to spend 3 days in Oslo. You plan to visit relatives in Oslo between day 16 and day 18. You plan to stay in Dubrovnik for 5 days. You would like to meet your friends at Dubrovnik between day 5 and day 9 to tour together. You want to spend 5 days in Naples.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nDubrovnik and Oslo, Frankfurt and Krakow, Frankfurt and Oslo, Dubrovnik and Frankfurt, Krakow and Oslo, Naples and Oslo, Naples and Dubrovnik, Naples and Frankfurt.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 18 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nDo not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The output is a JSON-formatted dictionary with the itinerary."
