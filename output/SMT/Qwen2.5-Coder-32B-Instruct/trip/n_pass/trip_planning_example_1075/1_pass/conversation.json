You want to spend 4 days in Vienna. You would like to visit Lyon for 3 days. You plan to stay in Edinburgh for 4 days. From day 5 to day 8, there is a annual show you want to attend in Edinburgh. You want to spend 5 days in Reykjavik. You want to spend 5 days in Stuttgart. You would like to visit Manchester for 2 days. You want to spend 5 days in Split. You are going to attend a wedding in Split between day 19 and day 23. You plan to stay in Prague for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nfrom Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Stuttgart and Split, Stuttgart and Vienna, Prague and Manchester, Edinburgh and Prague, from Manchester to Split, Prague and Vienna, Vienna and Manchester, Prague and Split, Vienna and Lyon, Stuttgart and Edinburgh, Split and Lyon, Stuttgart and Manchester, Prague and Lyon, Reykjavik and Vienna, Prague and Reykjavik, Vienna and Split.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 25 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nDo not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
