You plan to stay in Reykjavik for 4 days. You want to spend 2 days in Riga. You want to meet a friend in Riga between day 4 and day 5. You plan to stay in Oslo for 3 days. You want to spend 5 days in Lyon. You want to spend 2 days in Dubrovnik. You are going to attend a wedding in Dubrovnik between day 7 and day 8. You want to spend 2 days in Madrid. You want to spend 4 days in Warsaw. You would like to visit London for 3 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nWarsaw and Reykjavik, Oslo and Madrid, Warsaw and Riga, Lyon and London, Madrid and London, Warsaw and London, from Reykjavik to Madrid, Warsaw and Oslo, Oslo and Dubrovnik, Oslo and Reykjavik, Riga and Oslo, Oslo and Lyon, Oslo and London, London and Reykjavik, Warsaw and Madrid, Madrid and Lyon, Dubrovnik and Madrid.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 18 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nDo not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
