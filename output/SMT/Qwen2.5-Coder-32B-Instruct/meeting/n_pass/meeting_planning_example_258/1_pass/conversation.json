Betty will be at Presidio from 10:15AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 45 minutes. David will be at Richmond District from 1:00PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 90 minutes. Barbara will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15AM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
