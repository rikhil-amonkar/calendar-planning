Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nThe Castro to Bayview: 19.\nThe Castro to Pacific Heights: 16.\nThe Castro to Alamo Square: 8.\nThe Castro to Fisherman's Wharf: 24.\nThe Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nBayview to The Castro: 20.\nBayview to Pacific Heights: 23.\nBayview to Alamo Square: 16.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\nBayview to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nPacific Heights to The Castro: 16.\nPacific Heights to Bayview: 22.\nPacific Heights to Alamo Square: 10.\nPacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf: 13.\nPacific Heights to Golden Gate Park: 15.\nAlamo Square to The Castro: 8.\nAlamo Square to Bayview: 16.\nAlamo Square to Pacific Heights: 10.\nAlamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf: 19.\nAlamo Square to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nFisherman's Wharf to The Castro: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Pacific Heights: 12.\nFisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square: 20.\nFisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25.\nGolden Gate Park to The Castro: 13.\nGolden Gate Park to Bayview: 23.\nGolden Gate Park to Pacific Heights: 16.\nGolden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at The Castro at 9:00AM. Rebecca will be at Bayview from 9:00AM to 12:45PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 90 minutes. Amanda will be at Pacific Heights from 6:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Amanda for a minimum of 90 minutes. James will be at Alamo Square from 9:45AM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet James for a minimum of 90 minutes. Sarah will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 90 minutes. Melissa will be at Golden Gate Park from 9:00AM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
