Laura will be at Alamo Square from 2:30PM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 75 minutes. Brian will be at Presidio from 10:15AM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 30 minutes. Karen will be at Russian Hill from 6:00PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 90 minutes. Stephanie will be at North Beach from 10:15AM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 75 minutes. Helen will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:30AM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Sandra will be at Richmond District from 8:00AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 30 minutes. Mary will be at Embarcadero from 4:45PM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 120 minutes. Deborah will be at Financial District from 7:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 105 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Marina District from 8:30AM to 1:15PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
