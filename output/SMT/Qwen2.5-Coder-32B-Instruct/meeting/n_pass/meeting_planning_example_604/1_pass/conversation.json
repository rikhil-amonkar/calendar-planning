Karen will be at Russian Hill from 2:30PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 30 minutes. Stephanie will be at Nob Hill from 7:30AM to 9:30AM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 45 minutes. Joseph will be at Alamo Square from 11:30AM to 12:45PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 15 minutes. Kimberly will be at North Beach from 3:45PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The solution is printed in the required JSON format. Note that the code assumes that meetings must be scheduled in the order of the people dictionary, which may not be optimal. For a more optimal solution, additional logic would be needed to reorder meetings based on travel times and availability."
