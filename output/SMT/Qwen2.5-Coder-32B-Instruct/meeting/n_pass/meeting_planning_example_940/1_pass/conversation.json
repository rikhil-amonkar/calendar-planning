You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jessica will be at Russian Hill from 9:00AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 120 minutes. Jason will be at Marina District from 3:15PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 120 minutes. John will be at North Beach from 9:45AM to 6:00PM. You'd like to meet John for a minimum of 15 minutes. Karen will be at Chinatown from 4:45PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 75 minutes. Sarah will be at Pacific Heights from 5:30PM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 45 minutes. Amanda will be at The Castro from 8:00PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Amanda for a minimum of 60 minutes. Nancy will be at Nob Hill from 9:45AM to 1:00PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 45 minutes. Rebecca will be at Sunset District from 8:45AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The output is a JSON-formatted dictionary with the itinerary of meetings. Note that the program assumes that the meetings are sorted by their start times, and it tries to fit them into the schedule accordingly. Adjustments might be needed based on the specific requirements and constraints."
