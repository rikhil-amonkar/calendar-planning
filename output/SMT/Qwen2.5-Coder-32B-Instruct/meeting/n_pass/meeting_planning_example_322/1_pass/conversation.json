William will be at Russian Hill from 6:30PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 105 minutes. Michelle will be at Chinatown from 8:15AM to 2:00PM. You'd like to meet Michelle for a minimum of 15 minutes. George will be at Presidio from 10:30AM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet George for a minimum of 30 minutes. Robert will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:00AM to 1:45PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
