Sarah will be at Haight-Ashbury from 5:00PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 105 minutes. Patricia will be at Sunset District from 5:00PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 45 minutes. Matthew will be at Marina District from 9:15AM to 12:00PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 15 minutes. Joseph will be at Financial District from 2:15PM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 30 minutes. Robert will be at Union Square from 10:15AM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

If a solution is found, it prints the itinerary in the required JSON format. Note that the current implementation assumes a sequential meeting schedule without considering the possibility of revisiting locations or optimizing the order of meetings. Adjustments may be needed for more complex scenarios."
