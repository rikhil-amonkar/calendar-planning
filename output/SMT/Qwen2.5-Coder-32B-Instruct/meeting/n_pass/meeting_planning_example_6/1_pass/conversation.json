Kenneth will be at Nob Hill from 2:15PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

In this case, we want to meet Kenneth for at least 90 minutes, and we need to respect the travel time between locations. Here's how you can set up the problem in Python using Z3:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the time variables for the meeting with Kenneth\nkenneth_start = Int('kenneth_start')\nkenneth_end = Int('kenneth_end')\n\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = [\n    # Kenneth is available from 2:15PM to 7:45PM (14:15 to 19:45 in 24-hour format)\n    kenneth_start >= 14 * 60 + 15,  # 2:15PM\n    kenneth_end <= 19 * 60 + 45,    # 7:45PM\n    # You want to meet Kenneth for at least 90 minutes\n    kenneth_end - kenneth_start >= 90,\n    # You arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00AM (09:00 in 24-hour format)\n    # Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes\n    kenneth_start >= 9 * 60 + 0 + 11  # 9:00AM + 11 minutes travel time\n]\n\n# Create a solver instance\nsolver = Solver()\nsolver.add(constraints)\n\n# Check if the constraints are satisfiable\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    kenneth_start_time = model[kenneth_start].as_long()\n    kenneth_end_time = model[kenneth_end].as_long()\n    \n    # Convert the times back to HH:MM format\n    kenneth_start_time_str = f\"{kenneth_start_time // 60:02}:{kenneth_start_time % 60:02}\"\n    kenneth_end_time_str = f\"{kenneth_end_time // 60:02}:{kenneth_end_time % 60:02}\"\n    \n    # Create the itinerary\n    itinerary = [\n        {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": kenneth_start_time_str, \"end_time\": kenneth_end_time_str}\n    ]\n    \n    # Output the result as a JSON-formatted dictionary\n    result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary}\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up the constraints for meeting Kenneth within his availability and ensures that the meeting lasts at least 90 minutes, taking into account the travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill. The solution is then printed in the required JSON format."
