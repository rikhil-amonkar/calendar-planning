Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nRichmond District to Pacific Heights: 10.\nRichmond District to Marina District: 9.\nPacific Heights to Richmond District: 12.\nPacific Heights to Marina District: 6.\nMarina District to Richmond District: 11.\nMarina District to Pacific Heights: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Richmond District at 9:00AM. Jessica will be at Pacific Heights from 3:30PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 45 minutes. Carol will be at Marina District from 11:30AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The solution is then formatted into the required JSON structure. Note that the travel times are considered sequentially, and the solver ensures that the meetings fit within the available time slots and respect the travel constraints."
