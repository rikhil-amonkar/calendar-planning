Sarah will be at Sunset District from 10:45AM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 30 minutes. Richard will be at Haight-Ashbury from 11:45AM to 3:45PM. You'd like to meet Richard for a minimum of 90 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Mission District from 11:00AM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 120 minutes. Michelle will be at Golden Gate Park from 6:15PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Michelle for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It defines variables for the start and end times of each meeting and the current district for each meeting. It then adds constraints to ensure that each meeting fits within the person's availability, meets the minimum meeting duration, and accounts for travel times between meetings. Finally, it solves the problem and prints the itinerary in the required format."
