Paul will be at Nob Hill from 4:15PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Paul for a minimum of 60 minutes. Carol will be at Union Square from 6:00PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 120 minutes. Patricia will be at Chinatown from 8:00PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 75 minutes.

Matthew will be at Russian Hill from 3:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

If no solution is found, it will print \"No solution found\"."
