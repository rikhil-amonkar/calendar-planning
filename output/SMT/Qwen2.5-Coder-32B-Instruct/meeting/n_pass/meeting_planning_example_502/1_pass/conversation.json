Stephanie will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:00AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 105 minutes. Karen will be at Chinatown from 1:45PM to 4:30PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 15 minutes. Brian will be at Union Square from 3:00PM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 30 minutes. Rebecca will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00AM to 11:15AM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 30 minutes. Joseph will be at Pacific Heights from 8:15AM to 9:30AM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 60 minutes. Steven will be at North Beach from 2:30PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
