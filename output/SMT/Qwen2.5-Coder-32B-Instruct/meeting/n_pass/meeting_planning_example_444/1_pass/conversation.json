Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFinancial District to Russian Hill: 10.\nFinancial District to Sunset District: 31.\nFinancial District to North Beach: 7.\nFinancial District to The Castro: 23.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nRussian Hill to Financial District: 11.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to North Beach: 5.\nRussian Hill to The Castro: 21.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\nSunset District to Financial District: 30.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to North Beach: 29.\nSunset District to The Castro: 17.\nSunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nNorth Beach to Financial District: 8.\nNorth Beach to Russian Hill: 4.\nNorth Beach to Sunset District: 27.\nNorth Beach to The Castro: 22.\nNorth Beach to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nThe Castro to Financial District: 20.\nThe Castro to Russian Hill: 18.\nThe Castro to Sunset District: 17.\nThe Castro to North Beach: 20.\nThe Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nGolden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to North Beach: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to The Castro: 13.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Financial District at 9:00AM. Ronald will be at Russian Hill from 1:45PM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 105 minutes. Patricia will be at Sunset District from 9:15AM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 60 minutes. Laura will be at North Beach from 12:30PM to 12:45PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 15 minutes. Emily will be at The Castro from 4:15PM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 60 minutes. Mary will be at Golden Gate Park from 3:00PM to 4:30PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

Note that the code assumes a sequential meeting schedule starting from the Financial District and does not account for potential parallel meetings or revisiting locations, which could be more complex to model."
