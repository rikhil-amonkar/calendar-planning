Carol will be at Haight-Ashbury from 9:30PM to 10:30PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 60 minutes. Laura will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 11:45AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 60 minutes. Karen will be at The Castro from 7:15AM to 2:00PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 75 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Chinatown from 12:15PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 75 minutes. Deborah will be at Alamo Square from 12:00PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 105 minutes. Jason will be at North Beach from 2:45PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 90 minutes. Steven will be at Russian Hill from 2:45PM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
