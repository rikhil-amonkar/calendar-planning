Karen will be at Russian Hill from 8:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 60 minutes. Jessica will be at The Castro from 3:45PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 60 minutes. Matthew will be at Richmond District from 7:30AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 15 minutes. Michelle will be at Marina District from 10:30AM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Michelle for a minimum of 75 minutes. Carol will be at North Beach from 12:00PM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 90 minutes. Stephanie will be at Union Square from 10:45AM to 2:15PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 30 minutes. Linda will be at Golden Gate Park from 10:45AM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Linda for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
