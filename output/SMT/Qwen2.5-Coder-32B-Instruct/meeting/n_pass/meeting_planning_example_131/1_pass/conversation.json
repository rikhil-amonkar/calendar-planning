Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nPacific Heights to Presidio: 11.\nPacific Heights to Marina District: 6.\nPresidio to Pacific Heights: 11.\nPresidio to Marina District: 10.\nMarina District to Pacific Heights: 7.\nMarina District to Presidio: 10.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Pacific Heights at 9:00AM. Jason will be at Presidio from 10:00AM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 90 minutes. Kenneth will be at Marina District from 3:30PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
