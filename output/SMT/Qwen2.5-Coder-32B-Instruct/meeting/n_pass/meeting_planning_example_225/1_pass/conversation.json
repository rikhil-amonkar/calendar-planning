Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nSunset District to North Beach: 29.\nSunset District to Union Square: 30.\nSunset District to Alamo Square: 17.\nNorth Beach to Sunset District: 27.\nNorth Beach to Union Square: 7.\nNorth Beach to Alamo Square: 16.\nUnion Square to Sunset District: 26.\nUnion Square to North Beach: 10.\nUnion Square to Alamo Square: 15.\nAlamo Square to Sunset District: 16.\nAlamo Square to North Beach: 15.\nAlamo Square to Union Square: 14.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM. Sarah will be at North Beach from 4:00PM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 60 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Union Square from 3:00PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 75 minutes. Brian will be at Alamo Square from 4:00PM to 5:30PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
