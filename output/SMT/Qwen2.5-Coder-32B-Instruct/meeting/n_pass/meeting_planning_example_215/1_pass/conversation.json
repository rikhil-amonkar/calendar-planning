Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nBayview to Embarcadero: 19.\nBayview to Richmond District: 25.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\nEmbarcadero to Bayview: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Richmond District: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf: 6.\nRichmond District to Bayview: 26.\nRichmond District to Embarcadero: 19.\nRichmond District to Fisherman's Wharf: 18.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero: 8.\nFisherman's Wharf to Richmond District: 18.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Jessica will be at Embarcadero from 4:45PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 30 minutes. Sandra will be at Richmond District from 6:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 120 minutes. Jason will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:00PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
