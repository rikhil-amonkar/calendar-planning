You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 90 minutes. Barbara will be at Alamo Square from 10:00AM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 90 minutes. Nancy will be at Golden Gate Park from 4:45PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 105 minutes. David will be at The Castro from 9:00AM to 6:00PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 120 minutes. Linda will be at Bayview from 6:15PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Linda for a minimum of 45 minutes. Kevin will be at Sunset District from 10:00AM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 120 minutes. Matthew will be at Haight-Ashbury from 10:15AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 45 minutes. Andrew will be at Nob Hill from 11:45AM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Andrew for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
