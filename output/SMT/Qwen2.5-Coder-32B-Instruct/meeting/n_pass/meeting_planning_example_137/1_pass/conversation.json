Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFinancial District to Chinatown: 5.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nChinatown to Financial District: 5.\nChinatown to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nGolden Gate Park to Chinatown: 23.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Financial District at 9:00AM. Kenneth will be at Chinatown from 12:00PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 90 minutes. Barbara will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:15AM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
