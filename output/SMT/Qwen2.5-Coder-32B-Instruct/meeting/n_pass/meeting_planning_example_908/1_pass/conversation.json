Mark will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:15AM to 10:00AM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 30 minutes. Stephanie will be at Presidio from 12:15PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 75 minutes. Betty will be at Bayview from 7:15AM to 8:30PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 15 minutes. Lisa will be at Haight-Ashbury from 3:30PM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Lisa for a minimum of 45 minutes. William will be at Russian Hill from 6:45PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 60 minutes. Brian will be at The Castro from 9:15AM to 1:15PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 30 minutes.

You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 45 minutes. Patricia will be at Union Square from 4:30PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 120 minutes. Karen will be at Sunset District from 4:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
