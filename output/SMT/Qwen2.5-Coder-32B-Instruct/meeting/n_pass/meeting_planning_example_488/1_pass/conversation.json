Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nPacific Heights to Nob Hill: 8.\nPacific Heights to Russian Hill: 7.\nPacific Heights to The Castro: 16.\nPacific Heights to Sunset District: 21.\nPacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury: 11.\nNob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8.\nNob Hill to Russian Hill: 5.\nNob Hill to The Castro: 17.\nNob Hill to Sunset District: 25.\nNob Hill to Haight-Ashbury: 13.\nRussian Hill to Pacific Heights: 7.\nRussian Hill to Nob Hill: 5.\nRussian Hill to The Castro: 21.\nRussian Hill to Sunset District: 23.\nRussian Hill to Haight-Ashbury: 17.\nThe Castro to Pacific Heights: 16.\nThe Castro to Nob Hill: 16.\nThe Castro to Russian Hill: 18.\nThe Castro to Sunset District: 17.\nThe Castro to Haight-Ashbury: 6.\nSunset District to Pacific Heights: 21.\nSunset District to Nob Hill: 27.\nSunset District to Russian Hill: 24.\nSunset District to The Castro: 17.\nSunset District to Haight-Ashbury: 15.\nHaight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights: 12.\nHaight-Ashbury to Nob Hill: 15.\nHaight-Ashbury to Russian Hill: 17.\nHaight-Ashbury to The Castro: 6.\nHaight-Ashbury to Sunset District: 15.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Pacific Heights at 9:00AM. Ronald will be at Nob Hill from 10:00AM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 105 minutes. Sarah will be at Russian Hill from 7:15AM to 9:30AM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 45 minutes. Helen will be at The Castro from 1:30PM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Joshua will be at Sunset District from 2:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 90 minutes. Margaret will be at Haight-Ashbury from 10:15AM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
