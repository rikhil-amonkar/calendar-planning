Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFinancial District to Chinatown: 5.\nFinancial District to Alamo Square: 17.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10.\nChinatown to Financial District: 5.\nChinatown to Alamo Square: 17.\nChinatown to Bayview: 22.\nChinatown to Fisherman's Wharf: 8.\nAlamo Square to Financial District: 17.\nAlamo Square to Chinatown: 16.\nAlamo Square to Bayview: 16.\nAlamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf: 19.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nBayview to Chinatown: 18.\nBayview to Alamo Square: 16.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\nFisherman's Wharf to Financial District: 11.\nFisherman's Wharf to Chinatown: 12.\nFisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square: 20.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Financial District at 9:00AM. Nancy will be at Chinatown from 9:30AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 90 minutes. Mary will be at Alamo Square from 7:00AM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 75 minutes. Jessica will be at Bayview from 11:15AM to 1:45PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 45 minutes. Rebecca will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 7:00AM to 8:30AM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
