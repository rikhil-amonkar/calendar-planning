Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFisherman's Wharf to Presidio: 17.\nFisherman's Wharf to Richmond District: 18.\nFisherman's Wharf to Financial District: 11.\nPresidio to Fisherman's Wharf: 19.\nPresidio to Richmond District: 7.\nPresidio to Financial District: 23.\nRichmond District to Fisherman's Wharf: 18.\nRichmond District to Presidio: 7.\nRichmond District to Financial District: 22.\nFinancial District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10.\nFinancial District to Presidio: 22.\nFinancial District to Richmond District: 21.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00AM. Emily will be at Presidio from 4:15PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 105 minutes. Joseph will be at Richmond District from 5:15PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 120 minutes. Melissa will be at Financial District from 3:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
