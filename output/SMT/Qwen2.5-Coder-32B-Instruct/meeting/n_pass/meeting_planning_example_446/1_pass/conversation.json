Kimberly will be at Marina District from 1:15PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 15 minutes. Robert will be at Chinatown from 12:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 15 minutes. Rebecca will be at Financial District from 1:15PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 75 minutes. Margaret will be at Bayview from 9:30AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 30 minutes. Kenneth will be at Union Square from 7:30PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
