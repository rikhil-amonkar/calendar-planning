David will be at Mission District from 8:00AM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 45 minutes. Kenneth will be at Alamo Square from 2:00PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 120 minutes. John will be at Pacific Heights from 5:00PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet John for a minimum of 15 minutes. Charles will be at Union Square from 9:45PM to 10:45PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 60 minutes. Deborah will be at Golden Gate Park from 7:00AM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 90 minutes. Karen will be at Sunset District from 5:45PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 15 minutes. Carol will be at Presidio from 8:15AM to 9:15AM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

Adjustments might be needed if a different order is preferred or if additional constraints are introduced."
