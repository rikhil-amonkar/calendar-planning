Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nGolden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Presidio: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nAlamo Square to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nAlamo Square to Presidio: 18.\nAlamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nPresidio to Golden Gate Park: 12.\nPresidio to Alamo Square: 18.\nPresidio to Russian Hill: 14.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\nRussian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\nRussian Hill to Presidio: 14.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00AM. Timothy will be at Alamo Square from 12:00PM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Timothy for a minimum of 105 minutes. Mark will be at Presidio from 6:45PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 60 minutes. Joseph will be at Russian Hill from 4:45PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
