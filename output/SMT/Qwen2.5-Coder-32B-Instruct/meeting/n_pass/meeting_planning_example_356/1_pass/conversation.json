Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nBayview to North Beach: 21.\nBayview to Presidio: 31.\nBayview to Haight-Ashbury: 19.\nBayview to Union Square: 17.\nNorth Beach to Bayview: 22.\nNorth Beach to Presidio: 17.\nNorth Beach to Haight-Ashbury: 18.\nNorth Beach to Union Square: 7.\nPresidio to Bayview: 31.\nPresidio to North Beach: 18.\nPresidio to Haight-Ashbury: 15.\nPresidio to Union Square: 22.\nHaight-Ashbury to Bayview: 18.\nHaight-Ashbury to North Beach: 19.\nHaight-Ashbury to Presidio: 15.\nHaight-Ashbury to Union Square: 17.\nUnion Square to Bayview: 15.\nUnion Square to North Beach: 10.\nUnion Square to Presidio: 24.\nUnion Square to Haight-Ashbury: 18.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Barbara will be at North Beach from 1:45PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 60 minutes. Margaret will be at Presidio from 10:15AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 30 minutes. Kevin will be at Haight-Ashbury from 8:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 30 minutes. Kimberly will be at Union Square from 7:45AM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
