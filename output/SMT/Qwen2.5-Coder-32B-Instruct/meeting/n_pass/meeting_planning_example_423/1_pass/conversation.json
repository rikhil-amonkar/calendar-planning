Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nPresidio to Richmond District: 7.\nPresidio to North Beach: 18.\nPresidio to Financial District: 23.\nPresidio to Golden Gate Park: 12.\nPresidio to Union Square: 22.\nRichmond District to Presidio: 7.\nRichmond District to North Beach: 17.\nRichmond District to Financial District: 22.\nRichmond District to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nRichmond District to Union Square: 21.\nNorth Beach to Presidio: 17.\nNorth Beach to Richmond District: 18.\nNorth Beach to Financial District: 8.\nNorth Beach to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nNorth Beach to Union Square: 7.\nFinancial District to Presidio: 22.\nFinancial District to Richmond District: 21.\nFinancial District to North Beach: 7.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nFinancial District to Union Square: 9.\nGolden Gate Park to Presidio: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Richmond District: 7.\nGolden Gate Park to North Beach: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nGolden Gate Park to Union Square: 22.\nUnion Square to Presidio: 24.\nUnion Square to Richmond District: 20.\nUnion Square to North Beach: 10.\nUnion Square to Financial District: 9.\nUnion Square to Golden Gate Park: 22.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Presidio at 9:00AM. Jason will be at Richmond District from 1:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 90 minutes. Melissa will be at North Beach from 6:45PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 45 minutes. Brian will be at Financial District from 9:45AM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 15 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:45AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 105 minutes. Laura will be at Union Square from 2:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
