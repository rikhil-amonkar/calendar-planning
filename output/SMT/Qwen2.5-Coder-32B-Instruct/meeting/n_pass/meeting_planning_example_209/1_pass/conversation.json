Anthony will be at Chinatown from 1:15PM to 2:30PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 60 minutes. Rebecca will be at Russian Hill from 7:30PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 105 minutes. Melissa will be at North Beach from 8:15AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
