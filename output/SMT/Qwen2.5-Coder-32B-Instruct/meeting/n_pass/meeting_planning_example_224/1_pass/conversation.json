Melissa will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:30AM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 15 minutes. Nancy will be at Presidio from 7:45PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 105 minutes. Emily will be at Richmond District from 4:45PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
