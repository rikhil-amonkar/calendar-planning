Emily will be at Pacific Heights from 9:15AM to 1:45PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 120 minutes. Helen will be at North Beach from 1:45PM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 30 minutes. Kimberly will be at Golden Gate Park from 6:45PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 75 minutes. James will be at Embarcadero from 10:30AM to 11:30AM. You'd like to meet James for a minimum of 30 minutes. Linda will be at Haight-Ashbury from 7:30AM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Linda for a minimum of 15 minutes. Paul will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 2:45PM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Paul for a minimum of 90 minutes. Anthony will be at Mission District from 8:00AM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 105 minutes. Nancy will be at Alamo Square from 8:30AM to 1:45PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 120 minutes. William will be at Bayview from 5:30PM to 8:30PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 120 minutes. Margaret will be at Richmond District from 3:15PM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
