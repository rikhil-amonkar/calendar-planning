You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 30 minutes. Karen will be at Richmond District from 7:15PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 60 minutes. Rebecca will be at Nob Hill from 4:15PM to 8:30PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 90 minutes. Margaret will be at Chinatown from 2:15PM to 7:45PM.

Mark will be at North Beach from 2:00PM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 105 minutes. Melissa will be at Russian Hill from 1:00PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 30 minutes. Laura will be at Embarcadero from 7:45AM to 1:15PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
