Stephanie will be at Russian Hill from 8:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 15 minutes. Kevin will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 7:15PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 75 minutes. Robert will be at Nob Hill from 7:45AM to 10:30AM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 90 minutes. Steven will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:30AM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 75 minutes. Anthony will be at Alamo Square from 7:45AM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Anthony for a minimum of 15 minutes. Sandra will be at Pacific Heights from 2:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
