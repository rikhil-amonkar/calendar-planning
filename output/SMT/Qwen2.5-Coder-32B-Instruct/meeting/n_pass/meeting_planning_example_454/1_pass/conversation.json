Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nPresidio to Golden Gate Park: 12.\nPresidio to Bayview: 31.\nPresidio to Chinatown: 21.\nPresidio to North Beach: 18.\nPresidio to Mission District: 26.\nGolden Gate Park to Presidio: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Bayview: 23.\nGolden Gate Park to Chinatown: 23.\nGolden Gate Park to North Beach: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to Mission District: 17.\nBayview to Presidio: 31.\nBayview to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nBayview to Chinatown: 18.\nBayview to North Beach: 21.\nBayview to Mission District: 13.\nChinatown to Presidio: 19.\nChinatown to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nChinatown to Bayview: 22.\nChinatown to North Beach: 3.\nChinatown to Mission District: 18.\nNorth Beach to Presidio: 17.\nNorth Beach to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nNorth Beach to Bayview: 22.\nNorth Beach to Chinatown: 6.\nNorth Beach to Mission District: 18.\nMission District to Presidio: 25.\nMission District to Golden Gate Park: 17.\nMission District to Bayview: 15.\nMission District to Chinatown: 16.\nMission District to North Beach: 17.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Presidio at 9:00AM. Jessica will be at Golden Gate Park from 1:45PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 30 minutes. Ashley will be at Bayview from 5:15PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 105 minutes. Ronald will be at Chinatown from 7:15AM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 90 minutes. William will be at North Beach from 1:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 15 minutes. Daniel will be at Mission District from 7:00AM to 11:15AM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
