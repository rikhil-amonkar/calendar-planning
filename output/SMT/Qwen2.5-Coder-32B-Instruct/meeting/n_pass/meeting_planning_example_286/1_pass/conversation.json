Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nUnion Square to Mission District: 14.\nUnion Square to Bayview: 15.\nUnion Square to Sunset District: 26.\nMission District to Union Square: 15.\nMission District to Bayview: 15.\nMission District to Sunset District: 24.\nBayview to Union Square: 17.\nBayview to Mission District: 13.\nBayview to Sunset District: 23.\nSunset District to Union Square: 30.\nSunset District to Mission District: 24.\nSunset District to Bayview: 22.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Union Square at 9:00AM. Rebecca will be at Mission District from 11:30AM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 120 minutes. Karen will be at Bayview from 12:45PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Carol will be at Sunset District from 10:15AM to 11:45AM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
