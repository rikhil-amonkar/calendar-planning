Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nGolden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24.\nGolden Gate Park to Bayview: 23.\nGolden Gate Park to Mission District: 17.\nGolden Gate Park to Embarcadero: 25.\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Mission District: 22.\nFisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero: 8.\nFisherman's Wharf to Financial District: 11.\nBayview to Golden Gate Park: 22.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\nBayview to Mission District: 13.\nBayview to Embarcadero: 19.\nBayview to Financial District: 19.\nMission District to Golden Gate Park: 17.\nMission District to Fisherman's Wharf: 22.\nMission District to Bayview: 15.\nMission District to Embarcadero: 19.\nMission District to Financial District: 17.\nEmbarcadero to Golden Gate Park: 25.\nEmbarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf: 6.\nEmbarcadero to Bayview: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Mission District: 20.\nEmbarcadero to Financial District: 5.\nFinancial District to Golden Gate Park: 23.\nFinancial District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10.\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19.\nFinancial District to Mission District: 17.\nFinancial District to Embarcadero: 4.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00AM. Joseph will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00AM to 5:30PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Bayview from 5:30PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 60 minutes. Kevin will be at Mission District from 11:15AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 30 minutes. David will be at Embarcadero from 8:15AM to 9:00AM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 30 minutes. Barbara will be at Financial District from 10:30AM to 4:30PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
