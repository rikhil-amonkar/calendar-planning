Kevin will be at Pacific Heights from 7:15AM to 8:45AM. You'd like to meet Kevin for a minimum of 90 minutes. Michelle will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:00PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Michelle for a minimum of 15 minutes. Emily will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:15PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 30 minutes. Mark will be at Marina District from 6:15PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 75 minutes. Barbara will be at Alamo Square from 5:00PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 120 minutes. Laura will be at Sunset District from 7:00PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 75 minutes. Mary will be at Nob Hill from 5:30PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 45 minutes. Helen will be at North Beach from 11:00AM to 12:15PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
