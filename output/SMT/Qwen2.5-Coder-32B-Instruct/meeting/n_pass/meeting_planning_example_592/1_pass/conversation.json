James will be at Pacific Heights from 8:00PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet James for a minimum of 120 minutes. Robert will be at Chinatown from 12:15PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Union Square from 9:30AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 120 minutes. Carol will be at Mission District from 6:15PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 15 minutes. Mark will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:30AM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 15 minutes. Sandra will be at Nob Hill from 8:00AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
