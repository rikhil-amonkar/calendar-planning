Mary will be at Pacific Heights from 10:00AM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 45 minutes. Lisa will be at Mission District from 8:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Lisa for a minimum of 75 minutes. Betty will be at Haight-Ashbury from 7:15AM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 90 minutes. Charles will be at Financial District from 11:15AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
