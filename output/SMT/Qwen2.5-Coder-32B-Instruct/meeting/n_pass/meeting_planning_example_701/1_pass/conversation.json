Lisa will be at The Castro from 7:15PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Lisa for a minimum of 120 minutes. Daniel will be at Nob Hill from 8:15AM to 11:00AM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 15 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Presidio from 9:15PM to 10:15PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 45 minutes. Steven will be at Marina District from 4:30PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 90 minutes. Timothy will be at Pacific Heights from 12:00PM to 6:00PM. You'd like to meet Timothy for a minimum of 90 minutes. Ashley will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 60 minutes.

You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
