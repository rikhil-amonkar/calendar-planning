Sarah will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 2:45PM to 5:30PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 105 minutes. Mary will be at Richmond District from 1:00PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 75 minutes. Helen will be at Mission District from 9:45PM to 10:30PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 30 minutes. Thomas will be at Bayview from 3:15PM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Thomas for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
