You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Laura and Philip for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nLaura is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:30, Thursday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nPhilip has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00; \n\nPhilip can not meet on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
