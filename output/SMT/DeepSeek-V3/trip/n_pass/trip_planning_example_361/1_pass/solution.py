# - Days 7-10: Paris (3 days in Paris after flight day, total Paris days: 4 (days 7,8,9,10) but wait, no. Wait, flight day 7 is counted as a day in Paris and Madrid. So days in Paris: day 7 (flight day) + days 8,9,10 (3 days) → total 4 days. But we need 6 days in Paris. So this doesn't meet the requirement. So this manual solution is incorrect.
