    # Variables to represent the start and end days for each city visit
    # We'll model each visit as a segment with start and end days
    # Since there are multiple visits to some cities, we need to model each stay
    
    # For simplicity, assume each city is visited once (except for required overlaps)
    # We'll need to create segments for each stay
    
    # We'll model the itinerary as a sequence of 14 days, each day assigned to a city
    # But considering that flight days involve two cities
    
    # Alternatively, model the sequence of stays with transitions
    
    # Another approach: create intervals for each city's stay and ensure the sequence fits
    
    # Let's try to model the itinerary as a sequence of city stays with start and end days
    
    # We'll have to create variables for each stay's start and end days
    # But given the complexity, perhaps it's better to predefine possible segments
    
    # Given the constraints, let's try to manually find a feasible sequence first
    
    # Manual approach to find a feasible sequence:
    # - Start in Helsinki (days 1-2)
    # - Then fly to another city connected to Helsinki on day 2
    # - Continue ensuring all constraints are met
    
    # Given the complexity, let's try to find a possible sequence
    
    # Trying this sequence:
    # Day 1-2: Helsinki (workshop)
    # Day 2: fly to Reykjavik (so day 2: Helsinki and Reykjavik)
    # Day 2-8: Reykjavik? But need to meet friend on day 8-9. So perhaps:
    # Day 2-8: Reykjavik (but only 2 days required). So maybe:
    # Day 2-3: Reykjavik (2 days: day 2 and 3)
    # Then fly to another city on day 3.
    # But meeting friend is between day 8-9, so Reykjavik must include day 8 or 9.
    # So perhaps Reykjavik is visited later.
    
    # Alternative:
    # Day 1-2: Helsinki
    # Day 2: fly to Split (connected)
    # Day 2-6: Split (4 days: day 2,3,4,5)
    # Day 5: fly to Madrid (connected)
    # Day 5-9: Madrid (4 days: day 5,6,7,8)
    # Day 8: fly to Reykjavik (from Madrid, is there a flight? According to connections, yes: Reykjavik to Madrid is listed, but not sure if bidirectional. Assuming yes.
    # Day 8-9: Reykjavik (2 days: day 8 and 9)
    # Day 9: fly to Warsaw (connected)
    # Day 9-12: Warsaw (3 days: day 9,10,11)
    # Day 11: fly to Budapest (connected)
    # Day 11-14: Budapest (4 days: day 11,12,13,14)
    
    # Check constraints:
    # Helsinki: day 1-2. Workshop between day 1-2: OK.
    # Reykjavik: day 8-9. Meet friend between day 8-9: OK.
    # Warsaw: day 9-11. Visit relatives between day 9-11: OK.
    # Madrid: 4 days (day 5-8): OK.
    # Split: 4 days (day 2-5): OK.
    # Budapest: 4 days (day 11-14): OK.
    
    # Check flight connections:
    # Helsinki to Split: yes.
    # Split to Madrid: yes.
    # Madrid to Reykjavik: assuming yes (connections list Reykjavik to Madrid, assuming bidirectional)
    # Reykjavik to Warsaw: yes.
    # Warsaw to Budapest: yes.
