        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create an itinerary that visits 7 European cities over 20 days, adhering to the given constraints on stays in specific cities and flight connections. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to model the constraints and find a feasible schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem**: We need to model each city's stay duration and the transitions between cities via direct flights. The key is to ensure that the sequence of cities visited respects the flight connections and the specified constraints on days spent in each city and meetings during certain days.\n2. **Constraints Handling**:\n   - **Stays in Cities**: Each city has a required number of days to be spent there (e.g., 3 days in Stuttgart, 4 in Edinburgh, etc.).\n   - **Workshop and Meetings**: The workshop in Stuttgart must occur between days 11-13, meeting friends in Split between days 13-14, and meeting a friend in Krakow between days 8-11.\n   - **Flight Connections**: Only direct flights between certain cities are allowed, as listed.\n3. **Z3 Variables and Constraints**: Use Z3 to define variables for the start and end days of each city visit, ensuring overlaps for flight days and that all constraints are satisfied.\n4. **Generate Itinerary**: Once a model is found, translate the Z3 model into a human-readable itinerary in JSON format, including separate entries for flight days.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport json\n\ndef solve_itinerary():\n    # Cities to visit with their required days\n    cities = {\n        'Stuttgart': 3,\n        'Edinburgh': 4,\n        'Athens': 4,\n        'Split': 2,\n        'Krakow': 4,\n        'Venice': 5,\n        'Mykonos': 4\n    }\n    \n    # Direct flight connections\n    direct_flights = {\n        ('Krakow', 'Split'),\n        ('Split', 'Athens'),\n        ('Edinburgh', 'Krakow'),\n        ('Venice', 'Stuttgart'),\n        ('Krakow', 'Stuttgart'),\n        ('Edinburgh', 'Stuttgart'),\n        ('Stuttgart', 'Athens'),\n        ('Venice', 'Edinburgh'),\n        ('Athens', 'Mykonos'),\n        ('Venice', 'Athens'),\n        ('Stuttgart', 'Split'),\n        ('Edinburgh', 'Athens')\n    }\n    \n    # Ensure flights are bidirectional\n    additional_flights = set()\n    for (a, b) in direct_flights:\n        additional_flights.add((b, a))\n    direct_flights.update(additional_flights)\n    \n    # Create a list of city names\n    city_list = list(cities.keys())\n    num_cities = len(city_list)\n    total_days = 20\n    \n    # Z3 variables: for each city, start and end days\n    starts = {city: Int(f'start_{city}') for city in city_list}\n    ends = {city: Int(f'end_{city}') for city in city_list}\n    \n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Constraint: start and end days are within 1..20\n    for city in city_list:\n        s.add(starts[city] >= 1)\n        s.add(ends[city] <= total_days)\n        s.add(ends[city] >= starts[city])\n        s.add(ends[city] - starts[city] + 1 == cities[city])\n    \n    # Constraint: all cities are visited in some order without overlapping stays except for flight days\n    # To model this, we need to sequence the visits such that for any two different cities, their intervals are disjoint or they overlap only on flight days (i.e., one ends when another starts)\n    # However, this is complex.
