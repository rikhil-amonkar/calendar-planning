    # Flight constraints: only direct flights are Manchester-Seville and Stuttgart-Manchester
    # Possible itineraries:
    # Option 1: Start in Stuttgart, fly to Manchester, then to Seville, and back to Manchester or Stuttgart
    # Option 2: Start in Seville, fly to Manchester, then to Stuttgart, etc.
    # But total days must sum correctly with overlaps.

    # We need to model the transitions between cities. Let's assume the order is Stuttgart -> Manchester -> Seville.
    # Then the flight days are:
    # Flight from Stuttgart to Manchester on day stuttgart_end (same day arrival in Manchester)
    # Flight from Manchester to Seville on some day after Manchester starts.

    # Alternatively, another order. But for simplicity, let's try to find an order that satisfies the constraints.

    # We can model the order of visits. Let's introduce variables to represent the order.
    # For example, let's assume the cities are visited in a certain sequence, and flights happen between them.

    # Let's try to model the transitions:
    # The cities are visited in some order, with flights between them on specific days.

    # We can have three segments: the first city, then flight to second, then third.
    # But overlaps must be handled.

    # Alternatively, since the total days in cities is 6 + 7 + 4 = 17, and the total days is 15, there must be 2 days counted twice (flight days).

    # Each flight day is counted in two cities. So the total days is (days in cities) - (number of flight days) = 15.
    # Days in cities sum to 17, so there must be 2 flight days (since 17 - 2 = 15).

    # So there are two flight days in the itinerary.

    # Now, the possible flights are:
    # 1. Manchester-Seville
    # 2. Stuttgart-Manchester

    # So the itinerary must include exactly two flights (each contributing one flight day).

    # Let's assume the itinerary is:
    # Start in Stuttgart, stay until day X, fly to Manchester on day X (counted in both), stay in Manchester until day Y, fly to Seville on day Y (counted in both), stay in Seville until day 15.

    # Then:
    # Stuttgart: days 1 to X (X days)
    # Manchester: days X to Y (Y - X + 1 days)
    # Seville: days Y to 15 (15 - Y + 1 days)
    # Total days: X + (Y - X + 1) + (15 - Y + 1) = 17 - (number of flight days). But each flight day is counted in two cities, so the equation is:
    # X + (Y - X) + (15 - Y) + 2 (since two flight days are counted twice) = 15.
    # Simplifies to 15 + 2 = 17, which matches the sum of city days (6+7+4=17), with two flight days.

    # So let's model this.

    # Assume the order is Stuttgart -> Manchester -> Seville.

    # Then:
    # Stuttgart: 1 to stuttgart_end (6 days) → stuttgart_end = 6
    # Flight to Manchester on day 6.
    # Manchester: 6 to manchester_end (4 days) → manchester_end = 9
    # Flight to Seville on day 9.
    # Seville: 9 to 15 (7 days) → 15 -9 +1 =7. Correct.

    # Let's check the constraints:
    # Stuttgart: 1-6 (6 days)
    # Manchester: 6-9 (4 days, including day 6 and 9)
    # Seville: 9-15 (7 days)
    # Flight days: day 6 (Stuttgart-Manchester), day 9 (Manchester-Seville)
    # Total days: 6 (Stuttgart) +4 (Manchester) +7 (Seville) -2 (flight days counted twice) = 15.

    # This seems to satisfy all constraints.

    # So the solution is:
    # Stuttgart: 1-6
    # Flight to Manchester on 6
    # Manchester: 6-9
    # Flight to Seville on 9
    # Seville: 9-15

    # Now, let's verify the constraints:
    # - Total days: 6 (Stuttgart) +4 (Manchester) +7 (Seville) -2 (flight days) =15. Correct.
    # - Days in each city:
    #   Stuttgart: 6 days (1-6)
    #   Seville: 7 days (9-15)
    #   Manchester: 4 days (6-9)
    # - Meeting in Stuttgart between day 1-6: yes.
    # - Flight connections are valid: Stuttgart-Manchester and Manchester-Seville.

    # So this is a valid itinerary.

    # Let's encode this solution into the Z3 model.
