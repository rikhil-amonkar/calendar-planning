    # Flight days are when you transition from one city to another, counted for both
    # So, the intervals can overlap only on transition days

    # Possible sequences:
    # The cities can be visited in one of the possible orders, respecting flight connections
    # Possible orders:
    # 1. Stuttgart -> Manchester -> Seville
    # 2. Seville -> Manchester -> Stuttgart
    # 3. Manchester -> Stuttgart -> Manchester -> Seville (but total days in Manchester must be 4)
    # 4. Other combinations that respect flight connections.

    # We'll model possible sequences by allowing the intervals to be in certain orders.
    # For simplicity, let's assume one of the two main sequences:
    # Case 1: Stuttgart -> Manchester -> Seville
    case1 = And(
        stuttgart_end == manchester_start,
        manchester_end == seville_start,

    case2 = And(
        seville_end == manchester_start,
        manchester_end == stuttgart_start,
        seville_start < seville_end,
        manchester_start < manchester_end,
        stuttgart_start < stuttgart_end
    )

    # Also, other cases where Manchester is visited in between, possibly multiple times.
    # But given the constraints on total days, it's challenging to have multiple Manchester visits.
    # So, we'll consider the two main cases.

    s.add(Or(case1, case2))

    # Also, the sum of all unique days covered should be <= 15 + overlaps (since flight days are counted twice)
    # But the way the durations are set, the sum of (end - start + 1) for each city will include overlaps.
    # So the total is (6 + 7 + 4) - overlap_days = 17 - overlap_days.
    # Each flight day is counted twice, so overlaps are flight days.
    # For case1: two flight days (Stuttgart-Manchester and Manchester-Seville)
    # So total days: 6 + 7 + 4 - 2 = 15. Which matches.
    # Similarly for case2.
