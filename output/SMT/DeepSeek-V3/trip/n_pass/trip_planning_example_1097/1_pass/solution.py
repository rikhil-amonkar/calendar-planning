    # We need to model the itinerary as a sequence of stays and flights.
    # This is complex, so perhaps a better approach is to model the order of cities visited,
    # ensuring that consecutive cities are connected by a direct flight.
    
    # Let's attempt to find an order of visiting the cities such that:
    # 1. Each city is visited once (except for possible returns, but given the constraints, likely each once)
    # 2. The total days spent in each city matches the required days.
    # 3. The transitions between cities are via direct flights.
    
    # Since the problem requires an 18-day itinerary with overlapping flight days,
    # we need to model the start and end days for each city stay.
    
    # Let's use Z3 to model the start and end days of each city's visit.
    
    # Create a solver instance
    s = Solver()
    
    # We'll model the start and end days for each city.

    # The cities' stays must not overlap, except for flight days where one city's end is another's start.
    # Wait, no: the problem allows a day to be counted for two cities if it's a flight day.
    # So the end day of city A can be the start day of city B.
    # But other than that, no overlaps.
    
    # So for any two distinct cities A and B, their intervals [start_A, end_A] and [start_B, end_B]
    # must either be:
    # - A ends before B starts (end_A < start_B), or
    # - B ends before A starts (end_B < start_A), or
    # - A's end is B's start (end_A == start_B), or
    # - B's end is A's start (end_B == start_A).
    # But if neither of these, then it's an overlap, which is invalid.

        for city2 in cities:

    # The itinerary must cover all 18 days with no gaps.
    # So the union of all [start, end] intervals must cover 1 to 18 contiguously.
    # This is complex to model directly, so perhaps we can enforce that the cities are ordered in such a way.
    
    # Alternatively, we can model the sequence of cities visited.
    # Let's try that.
    
    # We'll have an array of 18 "days", where each day is assigned to a city.
    # But flight days are assigned to two cities.
    # This might be more straightforward.
    
    # So let's model each day as being in one or two cities.
    # But this is complicated.
    
    # Another approach: model the sequence of city visits with durations.
    # For example, the itinerary is a sequence of (city, duration) pairs, with transitions between consecutive cities being via direct flights.
    
    # But with Z3, this is hard to model directly.
    
    # Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to precompute possible orders of cities that respect the flight connections and then check the days.
    
    # But since this is a constraint problem, let's proceed with the start and end days.
