    # Variables: for each day, which city is visited. But since flight days involve two cities, we need to model this.
    # Possible modeling: for each day, have a variable indicating the city (or cities if it's a transition day).
    # Alternatively, have variables for start and end days in each city, with constraints on overlaps.
    
    # Another approach: for each day, the person is in one or two cities (if it's a transition day).
    # So, for each day, we can have a primary city and possibly a secondary city.
    # But this might be complex.
    
    # Instead, let's model the itinerary as a sequence of stays in cities, with each stay having a start and end day.
    # But this requires knowing the order of cities visited.
    
    # Alternative approach: for each day, the person is in exactly one city, except transition days where they are in two cities.
    # So, for each day, we have a variable indicating the city (or variables for multiple cities).
    
    # Let's try this:
    # For each day d, we have a variable indicating the current city (city on day d).
    # Additionally, for each day d, a Boolean variable indicating whether day d is a transition day (i.e., the person is in city[d] and city[d+1] on day d).
    
    # However, this may not capture the overlap properly.
    
    # Another idea: the itinerary is a sequence of (city, arrival_day, departure_day) tuples, with constraints that:
    # - arrival_day <= departure_day.
    # - For consecutive stays, the departure_day of the previous stay equals the arrival_day of the next stay (flight day counted for both).
    # - The flight between cities must be direct.
    # - The durations and specific constraints are satisfied.
    
    # This seems more manageable.
    
    # So, we can model the itinerary as a sequence of stays in cities.
    # The number of stays is variable, but since there are 6 cities, at least 6 stays (assuming each city is visited once, but possibly more if revisiting).
    # However, the problem says "visit 6 cities", so likely each city is visited once.
    
    # So, the itinerary is an ordered list of the 6 cities, with arrival and departure days for each.
    
    # Let's create variables for the order of cities.
    # We'll have 6 positions, each assigned to a city (all different).
    # Then, for each position, arrival and departure days.
    
    # But the problem allows revisiting cities? For example, could someone visit Milan, then another city, then Milan again?
    # The problem statement says "visit 6 European cities", which could imply each city is visited once.
    
    # Assuming each city is visited once, in some order.
    # So, the itinerary is a permutation of the 6 cities, with arrival and departure days for each.
