You would like to visit Brussels for 4 days. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 3 days. You want to spend 4 days in Stuttgart. You want to meet a friend in Stuttgart between day 1 and day 4. You would like to visit Mykonos for 2 days. You want to spend 2 days in Madrid. During day 20 and day 21, you have to attend a conference in Madrid. You would like to visit Helsinki for 5 days. You would like to visit Split for 3 days. You plan to stay in London for 5 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nHelsinki and London, Split and Madrid, Helsinki and Madrid, London and Madrid, Brussels and London, Bucharest and London, Brussels and Bucharest, Bucharest and Madrid, Split and Helsinki, Mykonos and Madrid, Stuttgart and London, Helsinki and Brussels, Brussels and Madrid, Split and London, Stuttgart and Split, London and Mykonos.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 21 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The approach involves modeling the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem where we define variables for each day's city and ensure that the transitions between cities are via direct flights, and all the stay duration requirements are met.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: For each day (1 to 21), define a variable representing the city the traveler is in on that day.\n2. **Flight Constraints**: Ensure that if the traveler changes cities between consecutive days, there must be a direct flight between them.\n3. **Duration Constraints**: Ensure the total days spent in each city matches the specified requirements.\n4. **Special Constraints**: \n   - The friend meeting in Stuttgart must occur between day 1 and day 4.\n   - The conference in Madrid must be on days 20 and 21.\n5. **Continuity Constraints**: Ensure that stays in a city are continuous blocks of days (except for flight days which are transitions).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport json\n\ndef solve_itinerary():\n    # Cities and their required days\n    cities = {\n        \"Brussels\": 4,\n        \"Bucharest\": 3,\n        \"Stuttgart\": 4,\n        \"Mykonos\": 2,\n        \"Madrid\": 2,  # Note: conference is on days 20-21, but total is 2 days (assuming the conference is part of the 2 days)\n        \"Helsinki\": 5,\n        \"Split\": 3,\n        \"London\": 5\n    }\n    \n    # Direct flights\n    direct_flights = {\n        \"Helsinki\": [\"London\", \"Madrid\", \"Brussels\", \"Split\"],\n        \"Split\": [\"Madrid\", \"Helsinki\", \"London\", \"Stuttgart\"],\n        \"Brussels\": [\"London\", \"Bucharest\", \"Madrid\", \"Helsinki\"],\n        \"Bucharest\": [\"London\", \"Madrid\", \"Brussels\"],\n        \"Mykonos\": [\"Madrid\", \"London\"],\n        \"Stuttgart\": [\"London\", \"Split\"],\n        \"Madrid\": [\"Split\", \"Helsinki\", \"London\", \"Brussels\", \"Bucharest\", \"Mykonos\"],\n        \"London\": [\"Helsinki\", \"Madrid\", \"Brussels\", \"Bucharest\", \"Split\", \"Mykonos\", \"Stuttgart\"]\n    }\n    \n    # Total days\n    total_days = 21\n    \n    # Create solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Day variables: day[i] is the city on day i (1-based)\n    days = [Int(f\"day_{i}\") for i in range(1, total_days + 1)]\n    \n    # City to integer mapping\n    city_ids = {city: idx for idx, city in enumerate(cities.keys())}\n    id_to_city = {idx: city for city, idx in city_ids.items()}\n    \n    # Constraint: each day must be a valid city\n    for day in days:\n        s.add(day >= 0, day < len(cities))\n    \n    # Flight constraints: consecutive days must be same city or connected by direct flight\n    for i in range(total_days -

Constraints ensure that:\n   - Each day's city is valid.\n   - Consecutive days either stay in the same city or transition via a direct flight.\n   - The total days spent in each city meet the specified requirements.\n   - Special constraints (conference in Madrid and meeting in Stuttgart) are enforced.\n3. **Model Evaluation**: If the solver finds a valid model, the itinerary is constructed by grouping consecutive days in the same city and adding flight day entries for transitions.\n4. **Output**: The itinerary is formatted as a JSON dictionary with day ranges and cities, including separate entries for flight days.\n\nThis approach systematically models the problem constraints and uses the Z3 solver to find a feasible itinerary that meets all requirements."
