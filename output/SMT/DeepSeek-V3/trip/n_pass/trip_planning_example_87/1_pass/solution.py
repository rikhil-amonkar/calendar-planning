    # But modeling this in Z3 requires a different approach.
    
    # Alternative approach: For each day, we have a variable indicating the current city, and possibly a flight to another city.
    # But it's complex. Instead, let's think of each day as being in one or two cities.
    
    # We'll create variables for each day indicating the city at start and end of the day.
    # But flights happen during the day, so the day is spent in both cities.
    
    # Let's define for each day, the cities that are visited on that day.
    # Each day can be in one city or two (if it's a flight day).
    
    # Create a list for each day, indicating the cities visited that day.
    # For Z3, we'll use a list of lists, where each inner list represents the cities for that day.
