    # Define the possible cities and their connections
    cities = ['Madrid', 'Dublin', 'Tallinn']
    connections = {
        ('Madrid', 'Dublin'),

    # Variables to represent the start and end days for each city segment
    # We'll model the itinerary as a sequence of segments where each segment is a stay in a city
    # Since the total is 7 days, we need to split into segments.

    # Let's assume the itinerary consists of up to 3 segments (visits to cities)
    # For each segment, we'll track the city, start day, and end day.

    # We'll model the itinerary as three segments (since three cities)
    # But the segments could be fewer if some cities are visited multiple times in separate segments.

    # Alternatively, we can model the sequence of cities visited and the days spent in each.
    # Given the constraints, the possible sequences are:
    # Madrid -> Dublin -> Tallinn
    # Or Madrid -> Dublin -> Tallinn -> Dublin (but this would exceed days)
    # Or other permutations respecting flight connections.

    # Let's try to model the sequence as a list of cities with their start and end days.

    # We'll assume the trip starts in Madrid (since it's the first mentioned and requires 4 days)
    # Then goes to Dublin, then Tallinn.

    # So the sequence is Madrid (days 1..a), then Dublin (a..b), then Tallinn (b..7)
    # Where a is the day of flight from Madrid to Dublin, b is the day of flight from Dublin to Tallinn.

    # Variables:
    a = Int('a')  # last day in Madrid (flight to Dublin on day a)
    b = Int('b')  # last day in Dublin (flight to Tallinn on day b)

    # Constraints:
    # 1 <= a <= 7, 1 <= b <=7
    s.add(a >= 1, a <= 7)
    s.add(b >= 1, b <= 7)

    # Days in Madrid: 1 to a (inclusive) → a days
    # But flight to Dublin on day a counts for both cities. So Madrid days: a (since days 1..a are in Madrid, but day a is also in Dublin)
    # Similarly, Dublin is from a to b, so b - a days (if b > a)
    # Tallinn is from b to 7 → 7 - b + 1 days (but day b counts for both Dublin and Tallinn)

    # Total days in Madrid: a (days 1..a)
    s.add(a == 4)  # since Madrid requires 4 days.

    # Days in Dublin: (b - a) (days a..b)
    s.add((b - a) == 2)  # because Dublin requires 3 days, but day a is counted in both Madrid and Dublin, day b in both Dublin and Tallinn.
    # Wait, no. The problem states that flight days are counted for both cities. So:
    # Madrid: days 1..a → a days (including day a, which is also in Dublin)
    # So total Madrid days: a =4.
    # Dublin: days a..b. The number of days is (b - a) + 1 (since both a and b are counted)
    # But the problem says you want to spend 3 days in Dublin. So (b - a) + 1 =3 → b -a =2.
    s.add(b - a == 2)

    # Tallinn: days b..7. Number of days is (7 - b) +1 =8 -b.
    # The problem says 2 days in Tallinn, including the workshop on days 6-7.
    s.add((7 - b + 1) == 2)
    # So 8 -b =2 → b=6.

    # Also, workshop is between day 6 and 7, so Tallinn must include days 6 and 7.
    # So b must be <=6, and 7 is the last day.
    # From 8 -b =2 → b=6.
