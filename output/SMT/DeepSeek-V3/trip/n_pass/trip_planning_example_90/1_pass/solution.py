    # Naples must be between day 1-5 (inclusive) for relatives
    # So we'll start in Naples from day 1 to day X, then fly to Vienna, etc.

    # Possible approach: 
    # Since Naples must include days 1-5, let's assume the stay in Naples is days 1-5 (since relatives are visited then).
    # Then, the flight to Vienna is on day 5 (so day 5 is in both Naples and Vienna).
    # Then, stay in Vienna from day 5 to day Y (including flight day to Vilnius).
    # Then, fly to Vilnius on day Y, stay until day 17.

    # Total days in Naples: 5 (days 1-5).
    # Total days in Vienna: days 5-Y (inclusive) plus the flight day from Vienna to Vilnius (day Y).
    # So days in Vienna: (Y - 5 + 1) = Y - 4 days. But the flight day is counted in both, so total Vienna days is Y -5 + 1 (if Y is the flight day).
    # Wait, perhaps better to model:

    # Naples: days 1-5 (5 days)
    # Flight to Vienna on day 5: day 5 is counted in both.
    # Vienna: days 5 to 5 + v_days -1 (since flight day is day 5, which is counted in both)
    # So total Vienna days: v_days. But we need 7 days in Vienna.
    # So v_days must be 7. So Vienna is days 5 to 11 (7 days: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11)
    # Then flight to Vilnius on day 11.
    # Vilnius: days 11-17 (7 days: 11,12,...,17)

    # Check totals:
    # Naples: 1-5 (5 days)
    # Vienna: 5-11 (7 days)
    # Vilnius: 11-17 (7 days)
    # Total days: 17. Checks out.
