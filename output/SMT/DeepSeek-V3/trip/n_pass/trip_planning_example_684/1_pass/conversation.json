Variables are created for each day and city to indicate presence.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - **City Presence**: Each day must have at least one city and no more than two (for flight days).\n   - **Flight Transitions**: If consecutive days are in different cities, there must be a direct flight between them, and the transition day counts for both cities.\n   - **Total Days**: The sum of days spent in each city must match the specified requirements.\n   - **Time Windows**: Specific constraints ensure the traveler is in certain cities during specified days.\n3. **Itinerary Construction**: The model's solution is parsed to construct the itinerary, handling flight days by duplicating the day for both departure and arrival cities. The itinerary is then processed to merge consecutive days in the same city and properly represent flight days.\n4. **Output**: The final itinerary is formatted as a JSON dictionary, listing each stay and flight day with the corresponding day ranges and cities.\n\nThis approach systematically models the problem using constraints and leverages the Z3 solver to find a valid itinerary that meets all given requirements."
