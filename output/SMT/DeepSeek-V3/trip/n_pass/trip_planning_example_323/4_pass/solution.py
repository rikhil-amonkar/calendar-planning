    # So we can assume that all 7 London days are within days 1-7.
    # But wait: the total trip is 16 days. If we have 7 days in London, but days 7 is also possibly in Split (since day 7 is in Split per the show constraint), but the flight day counts for both. So day 7 is Split, but if the flight to Split is on day 7 from London, then day 7 counts for both.
    # So the 7 London days could include day 7 if the flight is on day 7.
