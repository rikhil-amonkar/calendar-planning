The constraints include specific days in certain cities, flight connections, and overlapping days when traveling between cities. We'll use the Z3 solver to model this problem and find a valid itinerary.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem**: Each day (from 1 to 15) must be assigned to a city. The assignment must respect the constraints:\n   - Total days in each city: Dublin (5), Helsinki (3), Riga (3), Reykjavik (2), Vienna (2), Tallinn (5).\n   - Specific events:\n     - Vienna: Annual show between day 2 and day 3 (must be in Vienna on day 2 or 3).\n     - Helsinki: Meet friends between day 3 and day 5 (must be in Helsinki on at least one of these days).\n     - Tallinn: Attend a wedding between day 7 and day 11 (must be in Tallinn on at least one of these days).\n   - Flight connections: Travel between cities must be via direct flights as listed.\n\n2. **Z3 Variables and Constraints**:\n   - **Variables**: For each day (1 to 15), create a variable representing the city visited that day.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Total Days**: Ensure the sum of days in each city matches the required days.\n     - **Specific Events**: Ensure the specific days for Vienna, Helsinki, and Tallinn are respected.\n     - **Flight Connections**: When transitioning from one city to another, ensure there's a direct flight between them. This means that if day `i` is city A and day `i+1` is city B, there must be a direct flight from A to B.\n\n3. **Solving the Model**: Use the Z3 solver to find a satisfying assignment of cities to days that meets all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_itinerary():\n    # Cities\n    cities = ['Dublin', 'Helsinki', 'Riga', 'Reykjavik', 'Vienna', 'Tallinn']\n    city_map = {city: idx for idx, city in enumerate(cities)}\n    idx_map = {idx: city for idx, city in enumerate(cities)}\n    \n    # Direct flights (bidirectional)\n    direct_flights = [\n        ('Helsinki', 'Riga'),\n        ('Riga', 'Tallinn'),\n        ('Vienna', 'Riga'),\n        ('Reykjavik', 'Vienna'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Dublin'),\n        ('Tallinn', 'Dublin'),\n        ('Reykjavik', 'Helsinki'),\n        ('Reykjavik', 'Dublin'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Tallinn'),\n        ('Vienna', 'Dublin')\n    ]\n    # Correcting city names to match the list (note: 'Helsinki' vs 'Helsinki' in the list is 'Helsinki'?)\n    # Assuming 'Helsinki' is correct in the list, but in the direct_flights, it's 'Helsinki' (a typo)\n    # So, in the code, we'll use the correct names as per the problem statement.\n    # Wait, the problem statement lists the cities as Dublin, Helsinki, Riga, Reykjavik, Vienna, Tallinn.\n    # So the cities list should match these exactly.\n    # So correcting the cities list:\n    cities = ['Dublin', 'Helsinki', 'Riga', 'Reykjavik', 'Vienna', 'Tallinn']\n    city_map = {city: idx for idx, city in enumerate(cities)}\n    idx_map = {idx: city for idx, city in enumerate(cities)}\n    \n    # Re-defining direct_flights with correct city names:\n    direct_flights = [\n        ('Helsinki', 'Riga'),\n        ('Riga', 'Tallinn'),\n        ('Vienna', 'Riga'),\n        ('Reykjavik', 'Vienna'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Dublin'),\n        ('Tallinn', 'Dublin'),\n        ('Reykjavik', 'Helsinki'),\n        ('Reykjavik', 'Dublin'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Tallinn'),\n        ('Vienna', 'Dublin')\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a adjacency list for flight connections\n    flight_graph = {city: set() for city in cities}\n    for a, b in direct_flights:\n        flight_graph[a].add(b)\n        flight_graph[b].add(a)\n    \n    # Z3 solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Variables: day 1 to 15, each is a city (represented by an integer 0..5)\n    days = [Int(f'day_{i}') for i in range(1, 16)]\n    for day in days:\n        s.add(day >= 0, day < len(cities))\n    \n    # Constraints for total days in each city\n    total_days = [\n        ('Dublin', 5),\n        ('Helsinki', 3),\n        ('Riga', 3),\n        ('Reykjavik', 2),\n        ('Vienna', 2),\n        ('Tallinn', 5)\n    ]\n    # Wait, the problem states:\n    # Dublin:5, Helsinki:3, Riga:3, Reykjavik:2, Vienna:2, Tallinn:5.\n    # So correcting total_days:\n    total_days = [\n        ('Dublin', 5),\n        ('Helsinki', 3),\n        ('Riga', 3),\n        ('Reykjavik', 2),\n        ('Vienna', 2),\n        ('Tallinn', 5)\n    ]\n    \n    for city, required_days in total_days:\n        city_idx = city_map[city]\n        s.add(Sum([If(day == city_idx, 1, 0) for day in days]) == required_days)\n    \n    # Specific constraints:\n    # Vienna: annual show between day 2 and day 3.

So the code should use 'Helsinki' consistently.\n\nAlso, the total_days for Vienna was written as 'Vienna', but in the code, it was 'Vienna' (a typo). Correcting that.\n\nAlso, the direct_flights list in the code should match the problem statement's connections.\n\nLet me re-examine the direct flights from the problem statement:\n\nThe problem states:\n\n\"Here are the cities that have direct flights:\nHelsinki and Riga, from Riga to Tallinn, Vienna and Helsinki, Riga and Dublin, Vienna and Riga, Reykjavik and Vienna, Helsinki and Dublin, Tallinn and Dublin, Reykjavik and Helsinki, Reykjavik and Dublin, Helsinki and Tallinn, Vienna and Dublin.\"\n\nSo, parsing this:\n\n- Helsinki and Riga (bidirectional)\n- Riga to Tallinn (assuming bidirectional)\n- Vienna and Helsinki (bidirectional)\n- Riga and Dublin (bidirectional)\n- Vienna and Riga (bidirectional)\n- Reykjavik and Vienna (bidirectional)\n- Helsinki and Dublin (bidirectional)\n- Tallinn and Dublin (bidirectional)\n- Reykjavik and Helsinki (bidirectional)\n- Reykjavik and Dublin (bidirectional)\n- Helsinki and Tallinn (bidirectional)\n- Vienna and Dublin (bidirectional).\n\nSo the direct_flights list in the code should be:\n\ndirect_flights = [\n    ('Helsinki', 'Riga'),\n    ('Riga', 'Tallinn'),\n    ('Vienna', 'Helsinki'),\n    ('Riga', 'Dublin'),\n    ('Vienna', 'Riga'),\n    ('Reykjavik', 'Vienna'),\n    ('Helsinki', 'Dublin'),\n    ('Tallinn', 'Dublin'),\n    ('Reykjavik', 'Helsinki'),\n    ('Reykjavik', 'Dublin'),\n    ('Helsinki', 'Tallinn'),\n    ('Vienna', 'Dublin')\n]\n\nBut 'Tallinn' is spelled as 'Tallinn' in the cities list, so the code should use 'Tallinn' consistently.\n\nSo, correcting the code with these changes.\n\nAlso, in the total_days, the cities are 'Dublin', 'Helsinki' (no, it's 'Helsinki'), 'Riga', 'Reykjavik', 'Vienna', 'Tallinn'.\n\nSo the total_days list should be:\n\ntotal_days = [\n    ('Dublin', 5),\n    ('Helsinki', 3),\n    ('Riga', 3),\n    ('Reykjavik', 2),\n    ('Vienna', 2),\n    ('Tallinn', 5)\n]\n\nSo, the corrected code is:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_itinerary():\n    # Cities\n    cities = ['Dublin', 'Helsinki', 'Riga', 'Reykjavik', 'Vienna', 'Tallinn']\n    city_map = {city: idx for idx, city in enumerate(cities)}\n    idx_map = {idx: city for idx, city in enumerate(cities)}\n    \n    # Direct flights (bidirectional)\n    direct_flights = [\n        ('Helsinki', 'Riga'),\n        ('Riga', 'Tallinn'),\n        ('Vienna', 'Helsinki'),\n        ('Riga', 'Dublin'),\n        ('Vienna', 'Riga'),\n        ('Reykjavik', 'Vienna'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Dublin'),\n        ('Tallinn', 'Dublin'),\n        ('Reykjavik', 'Helsinki'),\n        ('Reykjavik', 'Dublin'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Tallinn'),\n        ('Vienna', 'Dublin')\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a adjacency list for flight connections\n    flight_graph = {city: set() for city in cities}\n    for a, b in direct_flights:\n        flight_graph[a].add(b)\n        flight_graph[b].add(a)\n    \n    # Z3 solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Variables: day 1 to 15, each is a city (represented by an integer 0..5)\n    days = [Int(f'day_{i}') for i in range(1, 16)]\n    for day in days:\n        s.add(day >= 0, day < len(cities))\n    \n    # Constraints for total days in each city\n    total_days = [\n        ('Dublin', 5),\n        ('Helsinki', 3),\n        ('Riga', 3),\n        ('Reykjavik', 2),\n        ('Vienna', 2),\n        ('Tallinn', 5)\n    ]\n    \n    for city, required_days in total_days:\n        city_idx = city_map[city]\n        s.add(Sum([If(day == city_idx, 1, 0) for day in days]) == required_days)\n    \n    # Specific constraints:\n    # Vienna: annual show between day 2 and day 3.
