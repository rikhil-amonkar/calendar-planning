    # Wait, no. The problem states that on flight days, the traveler is in both cities on that day. So for example, if flying from A to B on day X, then:
    # - On day X, the traveler is in A and B.
    # So the model should allow multiple cities per day.
    # But the initial constraints require that the sum of days in each city matches the required days.
    
    # So modify the approach:
    # For each day, the traveler can be in one or two cities. If in two, it's a flight day between them.
    # The sum of days counts each day in a city, so being in two cities on one day counts as one day for each.
