    # Ensure all cities are visited and their stays are non-overlapping except for flight days

    # Let's model the sequence as a list where each entry is a city and the day ranges
    # But for Z3, we need to find the order of visits and the flight days

    # Alternative approach: model the sequence of cities visited and the transitions
    # We'll need to define variables for the order and ensure flights are possible

    # Since the problem is complex, perhaps a better approach is to model the sequence of stays and flights

    # Let's define variables for the order of cities visited
    # We have four cities, and they must all be visited in some order
    # But since we have multiple stays, this might not be straightforward

    # Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to predefine possible orders and check feasibility
    # But for Z3, we can define the sequence as a list of intervals and ensure they don't overlap except for flights

    # Another approach: each city's stay must not overlap with others except for the flight day
    # So for any two cities, either one is completely before the other, or they overlap only on one day (flight day)
    # So for any two cities A and B, one of the following must hold:
    # A.end < B.start (A before B)

    # A.end == B.start or B.end == A.start (flight day)
