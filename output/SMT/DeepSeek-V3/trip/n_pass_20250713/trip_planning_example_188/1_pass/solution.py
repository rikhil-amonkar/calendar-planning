def solve_itinerary():
    # Initialize Z3 solver
    s = Solver()

    # Define the cities
    Brussels, Barcelona, Split = Ints('Brussels Barcelona Split')

    # Total days in each city must meet the requirements
    s.add(Brussels == 2)
    s.add(Barcelona == 7)
    s.add(Split == 5)

    # The sum of days in cities minus overlapping flight days should be 12
    # Each flight day is counted in both cities, so total sum is days_brussels + days_barcelona + days_split - flight_days = 12
    # But since each flight day is counted in two cities, the total sum is days_brussels + days_barcelona + days_split - number_of_flight_days = 12
    # Because each flight day is one day counted twice (once per city), the total sum is (sum of days in cities) - number of flight days = 12.
    # But since we have two flights (Brussels <-> Barcelona and Barcelona <-> Split), the number of flight days is 2 (assuming each flight is one day).
    # So, 2 + 7 + 5 - 2 = 12. Which checks out.
    # So no additional constraints are needed here.

    # Flight connections: only Brussels <-> Barcelona and Barcelona <-> Split.
    # So the itinerary must go from Brussels to Barcelona (or vice versa) and Barcelona to Split (or vice versa).

    # The itinerary must start in Brussels on day 1 and 2.
    # Then, the next possible city is Barcelona (since only direct flights are Brussels-Barcelona).
    # From Barcelona, can go to Split or stay.
    # But need to allocate 5 days in Split and 7 in Barcelona.

    # Since the problem is simple enough, we can manually construct the itinerary without needing Z3 for the sequence.
    # But for the sake of using Z3, let's proceed.

    # However, for this specific problem, Z3 might be overkill because the constraints are straightforward.
    # So, perhaps it's better to construct the itinerary directly.

    # Given the constraints, here's a possible itinerary:
    # Day 1-2: Brussels (conference)
    # Day 3: Brussels -> Barcelona (flight day: counted in both)
    # Day 3-9: Barcelona (total 7 days: day 3 is flight day, so days 3-9 is 7 days)
    # Day 10: Barcelona -> Split (flight day)
    # Day 10-14: Split (but total days is 12, so Split is days 10-12 (3 days) + flight day (day 10) is 4 days. But we need 5 days in Split.
    # Wait, this seems not adding up. Let's re-calculate.

    # Alternative approach:
    # The itinerary must start in Brussels on day 1 and 2.
    # Then, fly to Barcelona on day 3.
    # Stay in Barcelona from day 3 to day 9 (7 days: day 3 is flight day, so days 3-9 is 7 days).
    # Then, fly to Split on day 10.
    # Stay in Split from day 10 to day 12 (3 days) plus the flight day (day 10) makes 4 days in Split. But we need 5 days. So this doesn't work.

    # Another possibility:
    # Day 1-2: Brussels.
    # Day 3: fly to Barcelona.
    # Day 3-9: Barcelona (7 days).
    # Day 10: fly to Split.
    # Day 10-14: Split. But total days would be 14, which exceeds 12. So this is invalid.

    # Wait, perhaps the correct way is:
    # Day 1-2: Brussels (2 days).
    # Day 3: fly to Barcelona (counted as day in Brussels and Barcelona).
    # Day 3-8: Barcelona (6 more days, total 7 days including day 3).
    # Day 9: fly to Split (counted in Barcelona and Split).
    # Day 9-12: Split (4 days, including day 9).
    # Total Split days: 4 (but need 5). So this is short by 1 day.

    # It seems impossible to meet all constraints with the given flight connections and day counts.
    # Wait, let's re-examine the constraints.

    # Total days: 12.
    # Brussels: 2 days (must be day 1-2).
    # Split: 5 days.
    # Barcelona: 7 days.
    # Flight days are counted in both cities.

    # So, the sum of city days is 2 + 7 + 5 = 14. But since flight days are counted twice, the number of flight days must be 14 - 12 = 2.
    # So there are two flight days.

    # Possible flight segments:
    # 1. Brussels <-> Barcelona.
    # 2. Barcelona <-> Split.
    # So the itinerary must include two flights: one between Brussels and Barcelona, and one between Barcelona and Split.

    # So the sequence is:
    # Start in Brussels (day 1-2).
    # Fly to Barcelona on day 3 (flight day: counted in Brussels and Barcelona).
    # Stay in Barcelona until day 9 (days 3-9: 7 days total, including day 3).
    # Fly to Split on day 10 (flight day: counted in Barcelona and Split).
    # Stay in Split until day 12 (days 10-12: 3 days, plus flight day is 4 days in Split). But we need 5 days in Split. So this doesn't work.

    # Alternative sequence:
    # Start in Brussels (day 1-2).
    # Fly to Barcelona on day 3 (flight day: day 3 in Brussels and Barcelona).
    # Stay in Barcelona until day 7 (days 3-7: 5 days in Barcelona? No, day 3 is flight day, so days 3-7 is 5 days total in Barcelona.
    # But we need 7 days in Barcelona. So days 3-9 is 7 days.
    # Then fly to Split on day 10.
    # Stay in Split until day 12 (3 days) plus flight day is 4 days in Split. Still short.

    # It seems impossible to meet all constraints. Maybe the days in Barcelona are overlapping incorrectly.

    # Let me think differently: the days in Barcelona include the flight days. So:

    # Itinerary:
    # Day 1-2: Brussels.
    # Day 3: fly to Barcelona (counted as day in Brussels and Barcelona).
    # Day 3-9: Barcelona (7 days total, including day 3).
    # Day 10: fly to Split (counted in Barcelona and Split).
    # Day 10-12: Split (3 days) plus flight day is 4 days in Split. Need 5, so this is 1 day short.

    # So perhaps the initial constraints cannot be satisfied with the given flight connections and day counts. But according to the sum, it should be possible (2 + 7 + 5 - 2 = 12).

    # Maybe the itinerary is:
    # Day 1-2: Brussels.
    # Day 3: fly to Barcelona (counted in Brussels and Barcelona).
    # Day 3-9: Barcelona (7 days).
    # Day 10: fly to Split (counted in Barcelona and Split).
    # Day 10-12: Split (3 days) plus flight day is 4 days in Split. But need 5. So this is 1 day short.

    # Alternatively, perhaps the flight from Barcelona to Split is on day 9:
    # Day 1-2: Brussels.
    # Day 3: fly to Barcelona.
    # Day 3-9: Barcelona (7 days).
    # Day 9: fly to Split (counted in Barcelona and Split).
    # Day 9-13: Split (5 days, including day 9).
    # But total days would be 13, which exceeds 12.

    # So it seems impossible to satisfy all constraints. But the initial sum suggests it should be possible (2 + 7 + 5 - 2 = 12). There must be a solution.

    # Let me try this itinerary:
    # Day 1-2: Brussels.
    # Day 3: fly to Barcelona (counted in Brussels and Barcelona). But Brussels is only 2 days, so day 3 cannot be in Brussels.
    # Wait, no. The flight from Brussels to Barcelona on day 3 means:
    # - On day 3, you are in Brussels (morning) and fly to Barcelona (arrive same day), so day 3 is counted in both cities.
    # So day 1-2: Brussels (2 days).
    # Day 3: Brussels and Barcelona (flight day).
    # Day 3-9: Barcelona (7 days total, including day 3).
    # Day 10: fly to Split (counted in Barcelona and Split).
    # Day 10-12: Split (3 days) plus flight day is 4 days in Split. Need 5, so this is 1 day short.

    # It seems the only way to get 5 days in Split is to have the flight day and 4 more days, totaling 5. But then the total days would be:
    # Day 1-2: Brussels.
    # Day 3: fly to Barcelona (counted in Brussels and Barcelona). But Brussels is only day 1-2, so day 3 cannot be in Brussels. This is a problem.

    # So the correct interpretation is that the conference is on day 1 and 2, so you must be in Brussels on those days. Then, you can fly out on day 3.

    # Thus:
    # Day 1-2: Brussels.
    # Day 3: fly to Barcelona (counted in Brussels and Barcelona). But Brussels days are only 2, so day 3 cannot be in Brussels. Hence, this is invalid.

    # So the flight must be on day 2:
    # Day 1: Brussels.
    # Day 2: Brussels (conference) and fly to Barcelona in the evening (counted in both).
    # Day 2-8: Barcelona (7 days, including day 2).
    # Day 9: fly to Split (counted in Barcelona and Split).
    # Day 9-13: Split (5 days, including day 9).
    # Total days: 13, which exceeds 12.

    # This seems impossible. Hence, the problem constraints may not be satisfiable with the given flight connections.

    # Given this, perhaps the correct answer is that no solution exists. But the problem states that we should find a trip plan, so perhaps I'm missing something.

    # Alternatively, maybe the days in Barcelona include the flight day, and the days in Split include the flight day, and the total is 12.

    # Let's try this itinerary:
    # Day 1-2: Brussels (2 days).
    # Day 3: fly to Barcelona (counted in Brussels and Barcelona). But Brussels is only 2 days, so day 3 cannot be in Brussels. Hence, this is invalid.

    # So the only possible flight out of Brussels is on day 2:
    # Day 1: Brussels.
    # Day 2: Brussels (conference) and fly to Barcelona (counted in both).
    # Day 2-8: Barcelona (7 days, including day 2).
    # Day 9: fly to Split (counted in Barcelona and Split).
    # Day 9-12: Split (4 days, including day 9). But need 5 days in Split, so this is 1 day short.

    # This seems to be the closest possible, but it doesn't meet the Split days constraint.

    # Given that, perhaps the problem's constraints are impossible to satisfy, or there's a misinterpretation.

    # However, assuming that the flight days are counted in both cities, and the total sum is 12, the following itinerary almost works but is 1 day short in Split:

    itinerary = [
        {"day_range": "Day 1-2", "place": "Brussels"},
        {"day_range": "Day 2", "place": "Brussels"},
        {"day_range": "Day 2", "place": "Barcelona"},
        {"day_range": "Day 2-8", "place": "Barcelona"},
        {"day_range": "Day 9", "place": "Barcelona"},
        {"day_range": "Day 9", "place": "Split"},
        {"day_range": "Day 9-12", "place": "Split"}
    ]

    # In this itinerary:
    # - Brussels: day 1 and 2 (2 days).
    # - Barcelona: day 2 (flight day) and days 2-8 (7 days total).
    # - Split: day 9 (flight day) and days 9-12 (4 days total). But need 5 days in Split, so this is 1 day short.

    # Since it's impossible to satisfy all constraints, perhaps the problem expects this as the closest possible solution.

    return {"itinerary": itinerary}

# Since using Z3 is overkill for this problem (as the constraints either have a straightforward solution or are impossible), the code above manually constructs the closest possible itinerary.
