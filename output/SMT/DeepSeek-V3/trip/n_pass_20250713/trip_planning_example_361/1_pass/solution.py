    # 5. Continuity constraints: The person's location must follow a path with flights.
    # For each day transition, either stay in the same city or fly to a connected city.
    for day in range(1, 15):
        for city in range(4):
            # If in city on day and day+1, then either no flight or flight to another city.
            pass  # This is complex, but perhaps not needed if flight constraints are sufficient.

    # 6. The person starts in Madrid on day 1.
    # Already handled by days 1-7 in Madrid.

    # 7. The person must visit Seville for 3 days. These must be between day 8 and 13 (since 14-15 are Bucharest).
    # So, the 3 days in Seville must be within days 8-13.
    # Similarly, Paris's days must be within days 8-13 (since 1-7 Madrid, 14-15 Bucharest, and Paris has 6 days).
    # But 8-13 is 6 days, and Paris needs 6 days. So all days 8-13 must be Paris? But Seville needs 3 days. Contradiction.
    # Wait, but flight days count for both cities.
    # So between days 8-13, the person can have some days in Paris and Seville, with flight days counting for both.
    # For example:
    # - day 8: Madrid and Paris (flight)
    # - day 8-10: Paris (total 3 days in Paris)
    # - day 11: Paris and Seville (flight)
    # - day 11-13: Seville (3 days in Seville)
    # But this would give 3 days in Paris (days 8,9,10) and 3 days in Seville (11,12,13), but Paris needs 6 days.
    # Alternatively:
    # - day 8: Madrid and Paris (flight)
    # - day 8-13: Paris (6 days)
    # But then no days for Seville.
    # So the only way is to have flight days where both Paris and Seville are present, counting towards both totals.
    # For example:
    # - day 8: Madrid and Paris (flight) → counts for Madrid and Paris.
    # - day 9-10: Paris (2 days)
    # - day 11: Paris and Seville (flight) → counts for Paris and Seville.
    # - day 12-13: Seville (2 days)
    # - day 14: Seville and Bucharest (flight) → counts for Seville and Bucharest.
    # But this would give:
    # Paris: day 8,9,10,11 → 4 days (including flight day 8 and 11)
    # Seville: day 11,12,13,14 → 4 days (including flight days 11 and 14)
    # But Paris needs 6 and Seville 3. So this doesn't work.
    # This suggests that the problem may require more flight days where both cities are counted.
    # Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is missing something.

    # Let me think differently: the person is in Madrid days 1-7 (7 days).
    # Then, days 8-13 (6 days) must cover Paris (6 days) and Seville (3 days).
    # The only way is that some days are flight days where both Paris and Seville are present.
    # For example:
    # - day 8: Madrid and Paris (flight) → counts for Madrid and Paris. But Madrid is already at 7 days (days 1-7), so day 8 can't be in Madrid.
    # Wait, no: days 1-7 are in Madrid. So day 8 is the first day after Madrid.
    # So, day 8: the person must fly from Madrid to somewhere. Possible destinations: Paris, Bucharest, Seville.
    # But Bucharest is only on days 14-15, so day 8 must be to Paris or Seville.
    # Let's assume day 8 is a flight from Madrid to Paris.
    # So day 8: Madrid and Paris. But Madrid's days are only 1-7, so day 8 can't be in Madrid.
    # This suggests that the flight from Madrid must be on day 7 or day 8.
    # But day 7 is the last day in Madrid (days 1-7). So the flight must be on day 7 to another city.
    # So, day 7: Madrid and another city (Paris, Bucharest, or Seville).
    # But Bucharest is only on days 14-15, so day 7 must be Madrid and Paris or Madrid and Seville.
    # Let's choose Madrid and Paris.
    # So day 7: Madrid and Paris.
    # Then, days 8-13: Paris and/or Seville.
    # Paris needs 6 days total. Already 1 (day 7). So 5 more.
    # Seville needs 3 days.
    # The 6 days from 8-13 must account for 5 Paris and 3 Seville days, which sums to 8, but with overlap on flight days.
    # For example:
    # - day 7: Madrid and Paris.
    # - day 8-10: Paris (3 days → total Paris days: day 7,8,9,10 → 4 days).
    # - day 11: Paris and Seville (flight) → day 11 counts for Paris and Seville.
    # - day 12-13: Seville (2 days → total Seville days: day 11,12,13 → 3 days).
    # Paris days: 7,8,9,10,11 → 5 days. Need 6.
    # So perhaps:
    # - day 7: Madrid and Paris.
    # - day 8-11: Paris (4 days → total Paris days: 7,8,9,10,11 → 5 days).
    # - day 12: Paris and Seville (flight) → day 12 counts for Paris and Seville.
    # - day 13: Seville.
    # Paris days: 7,8,9,10,11,12 → 6 days.
    # Seville days: 12,13 → 2 days. Need 3.
    # So add another day in Seville. But only day 13 is left. So this doesn't work.
    # Alternative:
    # - day 7: Madrid and Paris.
    # - day 8-10: Paris (3 days → total Paris: 7,8,9,10 → 4 days).
    # - day 11: Paris and Seville (flight) → counts for both.
    # - day 12-13: Seville (2 days → Seville days: 11,12,13 → 3 days).
    # Paris days: 7,8,9,10,11 → 5 days. Need 6.
    # So need one more Paris day. But days 8-13 are 6 days, and we've allocated 5 Paris and 3 Seville (with overlap on day 11).
    # So it's impossible to have 6 Paris and 3 Seville days in 6 days (8-13) with overlaps.
    # This suggests that the initial constraints may not be satisfiable.

    # But perhaps the flight from Madrid is on day 7 to Seville.
    # So day 7: Madrid and Seville.
    # Then, days 8-13: Seville and Paris.
    # Seville needs 3 days total. Already 1 (day 7). So 2 more.
    # Paris needs 6 days.
    # So days 8-13 (6 days) must cover 6 Paris and 2 Seville days.
    # For example:
    # - day 7: Madrid and Seville.
    # - day 8: Seville and Paris (flight) → counts for both.
    # - day 9-13: Paris (5 days).
    # Seville days: 7,8 → 2. Need 3.
    # So not enough.
    # Alternative:
    # - day 7: Madrid and Seville.
    # - day 8-9: Seville (2 days → total Seville: 7,8,9 → 3 days).
    # - day 10: Seville and Paris (flight) → counts for both.
    # - day 11-13: Paris (3 days → total Paris: 10,11,12,13 → 4 days). Need 6.
    # Not enough.
    # So this approach also doesn't work.

    # This suggests that the problem may not have a solution under the given constraints.
