    # Create the solver

    # Define the cities
    cities = ['Riga', 'Amsterdam', 'Mykonos']
    
    # Variables for start and end days in each city
    # We'll model the sequence of cities visited and the days spent in each
    # Since there are 3 cities, the trip could involve 1, 2, or 3 segments (but sum to 7 days)
    # But given the constraints, it's likely two segments (since Mykonos requires 5 days)
    
    # Possible sequences:
    # Riga -> Amsterdam -> Mykonos
    # Or other permutations, but must respect direct flights
    
    # Direct flights: Riga <-> Amsterdam, Amsterdam <-> Mykonos
    # So valid sequences:
    # Riga -> Amsterdam -> Mykonos
    # Riga -> Amsterdam (but total days would be 4, not 7)
    # Mykonos -> Amsterdam -> Riga
    # etc.
    
    # Let's model the sequence as a list where each element is a city, and the days spent
    
    # We can represent the itinerary as a sequence of steps, each with a city and days
    # But it's complex. Alternatively, since the constraints are tight, we can try possible sequences
    
    # Given the constraints, one possible sequence is:
    # Day 1-2: Riga (must include day 1 and 2)
    # Then fly to Amsterdam on day 3 (spend day 3 in Amsterdam)
    # Then fly to Mykonos on day 4 (spend day 4 in Mykonos), stay until day 7
    
    # Check if this meets the constraints:
    # Riga: days 1 and 2 (2 days)
    # Amsterdam: day 3 (1 day) → but need 2 days. So this doesn't work.
    
    # Another possibility:
    # Day 1: Riga
    # Day 2: Riga (flight to Amsterdam on day 2)
    # So day 2 is in Riga and Amsterdam
    # Then day 3: Amsterdam
    # Then fly to Mykonos on day 4: day 4 in Amsterdam and Mykonos
    # Then days 4-7 in Mykonos (total 4 days in Mykonos: days 4,5,6,7 → but need 5. So day 4 is counted for both, so 4 days in Mykonos (4,5,6,7) → 4 days, but need 5. So this doesn't work.
    
    # Another try:
    # Day 1: Riga
    # Day 2: Riga and fly to Amsterdam → day 2 in Riga and Amsterdam
    # Days 2 and 3 in Amsterdam (total 2 days in Amsterdam: day 2 and 3)
    # Then fly to Mykonos on day 4: day 4 in Amsterdam and Mykonos
    # Days 4-7 in Mykonos: 4 days (4,5,6,7) plus day 4 from flight → total 4 days. Need 5. So this is short.
    
    # Alternative approach: start in Mykonos for 5 days, then Amsterdam for 2 days.
    # But the flight from Mykonos is only to Amsterdam. Then from Amsterdam to Riga.
    # So:
    # Days 1-5: Mykonos
    # Fly to Amsterdam on day 5: day 5 in Mykonos and Amsterdam
    # Days 5-6 in Amsterdam (day 5 and 6) → 2 days in Amsterdam (including flight day)
    # Then fly to Riga on day 7: day 7 in Amsterdam and Riga.
    # But Riga requires 2 days, but only day 7 is spent. So this doesn't meet Riga's constraint.
    
    # Another possibility: start in Riga, then Amsterdam, then Mykonos.
    # Day 1: Riga
    # Day 2: Riga and fly to Amsterdam → day 2 in Riga and Amsterdam
    # Days 2-3 in Amsterdam (2 days: day 2 and 3)
    # Fly to Mykonos on day 4: day 4 in Amsterdam and Mykonos.
    # Days 4-7 in Mykonos: 4 days (4,5,6,7) → total 4 days in Mykonos, but need 5. So day 4 is counted for both, so Mykonos gets 4 days. Doesn't work.
    
    # Another idea: spend 3 days in Mykonos initially, but that doesn't help.
    
    # After several trials, it seems impossible to meet all constraints with the given flight connections and day requirements.
    # But wait, perhaps:
    # Day 1: Riga
    # Day 2: Riga and fly to Amsterdam → day 2 in Riga and Amsterdam (Riga: 2 days; Amsterdam: day 2)
    # Day 3: Amsterdam
    # Fly to Mykonos on day 4: day 4 in Amsterdam and Mykonos (Amsterdam: 2 days (2 and 3), Mykonos: day 4)
    # Days 4-7 in Mykonos: 4 days (4,5,6,7) → total 5 days in Mykonos (including flight day)
    # Riga: 2 days (1 and 2)
    # Amsterdam: 2 days (2 and 3)
    # Mykonos: 5 days (4,5,6,7 plus flight day 4)
    
    # This meets all constraints:
    # - 2 days in Riga (days 1 and 2)
    # - 2 days in Amsterdam (days 2 and 3)
    # - 5 days in Mykonos (days 4,5,6,7, with day 4 counted twice)
    # - Flights are direct: Riga-Amsterdam on day 2, Amsterdam-Mykonos on day 4.
