    # Correcting typo in direct_flights (Venice is spelled as Venice, Istanbul's list has "Venice" as "Venice")
    # Also, "Krakow" is spelled as "Krakow" in cities, but in direct_flights, it's "Krakow" and "Krakow". Correcting.
    # Assuming the adjacency list is correct except for possible typos.
    # For example, in Istanbul's list: "Venice" is correct, "Krakow" is correct.
    # So no changes needed if the data is correct.

    # We need to model the sequence of visits. Let's assume we can visit cities in some order, with flights between them.
    # However, modeling the exact sequence with Z3 is complex. Instead, we can precompute possible sequences and check constraints.

    # But given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to manually determine the sequence based on constraints and use Z3 to validate or find possible day distributions.

    # Alternative approach: since the problem may be small enough, we can manually construct possible sequences and check constraints.

    # Given the constraints:
    # - Manchester must be visited between day 1-3 (wedding). So likely starts in Manchester.
    # - Venice has a workshop between day 3-9. So must be in Venice by day 3 at the latest, but Manchester is days 1-3.
    # So the first transition is from Manchester to another city on day 3.

    # Possible sequences:
    # Option 1: Manchester (1-3) -> Venice (3-10) but that's 7 days (3-9: 7 days). Then remaining days: 21 - 3 -7 = 11. Need to visit Istanbul (7), Krakow (6), Lyon (2). But 7+6+2=15 >11. So this sequence doesn't work.
    # Option 2: Manchester (1-3) -> Venice (3-5) -> ... but Venice needs 7 days. So must stay in Venice until day 9 or later.
    # Alternatively, Manchester (1-3), then fly to Istanbul (3-10), but Venice's workshop is between day 3-9. So must be in Venice during those days. So this sequence doesn't work.

    # Another option: Manchester (1-3), fly to Venice on day 3. Stay in Venice until day 10 (7 days: 3-9 is 7 days). Then remaining days: 21-3-7=11. Then fly to Istanbul (10-17: 7 days), but 17+ remaining cities exceed 21. Not possible.

    # Alternatively, after Venice, fly to Lyon (2 days), then Istanbul (7 days), then Krakow (6 days). Total days: 3 (Manchester) +7 (Venice) +2 (Lyon) +7 (Istanbul) +6 (Krakow) = 25 >21. Doesn't work.

    # So perhaps the sequence is Manchester, Venice, Istanbul, Krakow, Lyon.
    # Manchester 1-3 (3 days), fly to Venice on day 3.
    # Venice 3-10 (7 days), fly to Istanbul on day 10.
    # Istanbul 10-17 (7 days), fly to Krakow on day 17.
    # Krakow 17-23 (6 days), but total exceeds 21. So this doesn't work.

    # Another sequence: Manchester 1-3, fly to Venice 3-10 (7 days), fly to Lyon 10-12 (2 days), fly to Istanbul 12-19 (7 days), fly to Krakow 19-25 (6 days). Total is 3+7+2+7+6=25. Still over.

    # Maybe reduce Venice's days. But Venice must be 7 days (with workshop between 3-9). So 3-10 is 7 days.

    # Alternative: start in Manchester 1-3, fly to Venice 3-10 (7 days), then fly to Krakow 10-16 (6 days), then fly to Istanbul 16-23 (7 days). Total 3+7+6+7=23. Still over.

    # Maybe include Lyon in the middle. For example:
    # Manchester 1-3, Venice 3-10, fly to Lyon 10-12 (2 days), fly to Istanbul 12-19 (7 days), fly to Krakow 19-21 (2 days). But Krakow needs 6 days. So this doesn't meet Krakow's requirement.

    # It seems challenging to fit all cities into 21 days with the given constraints. Perhaps the only feasible solution is to omit one city. But the problem states to visit all 5 cities.

    # Re-examizing the constraints:
    # The workshop in Venice is between day 3-9. So Venice must include these days. So the 7 days in Venice must cover days 3-9. So possible Venice stay is 3-9 (7 days? Wait, 3-9 is 7 days (3,4,5,6,7,8,9). So yes, 7 days.
    # So Manchester is 1-3 (3 days), fly to Venice on day 3, stay until day 9 (7 days). Total so far: 3 +7 =10 days.
    # Remaining days: 21-10=11 days.
    # Need to visit Istanbul (7), Krakow (6), Lyon (2). 7+6+2=15 >11. So impossible to visit all cities with given constraints.

    # Thus, the only way is to adjust the days in some cities. But the problem specifies the exact days for each city. So perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

    # Alternative interpretation: the workshop in Venice is between day 3 and day 9, but the stay in Venice is 7 days not necessarily covering the entire workshop period. For example, the workshop could be a subset of the stay.

    # So perhaps Venice stay is 7 days that must include at least some days between 3-9.

    # But the problem says "You want to spend 7 days in Venice. You have to attend a workshop in Venice between day 3 and day 9." So the 7 days must include the workshop days. So the 7-day stay must overlap with days 3-9.

    # So the Venice stay must be a 7-day period that includes at least one day between 3-9. For example, 2-8 (7 days: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8), which includes 3-8. Or 3-9 (7 days). Or 4-10 (7 days: includes 4-9). But the workshop is between 3-9, so the stay must include at least day 3 or day 9.

    # But even with this, the total days for other cities would still exceed the remaining days.

    # Given the constraints, it's impossible to visit all five cities within 21 days while meeting all the stay durations and event constraints.

    # Therefore, the answer is that no valid itinerary exists under the given constraints.

    # However, the problem expects a solution, so perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

    # Let me re-examine the problem statement.

    # The key is the flight days: if you fly from A to B on day X, you are in both cities on day X. So the day X counts for both cities. So the total days is the sum of unique days across all cities, with overlapping days counted once.

    # So for example, if you are in Manchester on day 3 and fly to Venice on day 3, then day 3 counts for both Manchester and Venice. But the total unique days is still just day 3 counted once.

    # So the sum of days in each city is not the sum of unique days, but the sum of days spent in each city, which can overlap on flight days.

    # So the total is the sum of days in each city, minus the overlapping flight days (since those days are counted twice).

    # For example, if you have:
    # Manchester: 3 days (1,2,3)
    # Fly to Venice on day 3.
    # Venice: 7 days (3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
    # Total unique days: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 (9 days)
    # Sum of city days: Manchester 3 + Venice 7 = 10. But day 3 is counted twice, so total unique days is 3+7-1=9.

    # So the total unique days is sum(city_days) - number of flight days (each flight day is counted twice).

    # The problem states total days is 21. So sum(city_days) - flight_days = 21.

    # Each flight is between two cities on a single day, so each flight contributes 1 to the flight_days count.

    # Number of flights is (number of cities visited - 1). So for 5 cities, there are 4 flights.

    # So sum(city_days) - 4 = 21 → sum(city_days) = 25.

    # The required city days are Manchester 3, Istanbul 7, Venice 7, Krakow 6, Lyon 2. Sum is 3+7+7+6+2=25. So this matches.

    # So the problem is feasible. Now, we need to find a sequence where the sum of city days is 25, and the flight days are 4, leading to 21 unique days.

    # Now, we can proceed to construct the itinerary.

    # Given the constraints:
    # - Manchester must include days 1-3 (since the wedding is between day 1-3). So Manchester is days 1,2,3.
    # - On day 3, fly to another city. Possible options from Manchester: Venice, Istanbul, Krakow.

    # Option 1: Fly to Venice on day 3.
    # - Venice must include 7 days, and the workshop is between day 3-9. So the 7 days must include day 3.
    # So possible Venice stay: day 3-9 (7 days).
    # Then, from Venice, possible flights are to Istanbul, Lyon, Manchester. But Manchester is already visited.
    # Next, fly to Istanbul on day 9.
    # Istanbul requires 7 days. So day 9-15 (7 days).
    # Then, from Istanbul, fly to Krakow on day 15.
    # Krakow requires 6 days: day 15-20 (6 days).
    # Then, fly to Lyon on day 20.
    # Lyon requires 2 days: day 20-21 (2 days).
    # Total unique days: day 1-21 (21 days).
    # Check city days:
    # Manchester: 1,2,3 → 3 days.
    # Venice: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 → 7 days.
    # Istanbul: 9,10,11,12,13,14,15 → 7 days.
    # Krakow: 15,16,17,18,19,20 → 6 days.
    # Lyon: 20,21 → 2 days.
    # Flights:
    # - day 3: Manchester → Venice.
    # - day 9: Venice → Istanbul.
    # - day 15: Istanbul → Krakow.
    # - day 20: Krakow → Lyon.
    # Total flights: 4. Sum of city days: 3+7+7+6+2=25. 25 -4=21. Correct.

    # This sequence meets all constraints.

    # Now, construct the itinerary in the required JSON format.
