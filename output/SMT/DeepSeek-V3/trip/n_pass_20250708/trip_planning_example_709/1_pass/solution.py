    # Correcting city name inconsistencies (e.g., Helsinki vs Helsinki)
    # Assuming the correct names are as per the problem statement
    # So, mapping might be needed, but for now, proceed with the given names
    
    # We need to model the sequence of visits with start and end days for each city stay
    # This is complex; alternatively, model the order of cities visited and durations
    
    # Alternative approach: model the order of visits and flight days
    
    # Let's create a list of city visits in order, with durations, ensuring flights exist between consecutive cities
    
    # We'll use Z3 to find the order and durations
    
    # Total days: 18. Each stay contributes its days, and each flight transition contributes 1 day (counted in both cities)
    
    # The Porto stay must include days 16-18, so Porto's stay must end on day 18, and start on day 16 - (3-1) = day 16 - 2 = day 14? Or wait, if staying for 3 days ending on day 18, starts on day 16 (16,17,18).
    # So Porto's stay is days 16-18.
    
    # Thus, the arrival in Porto is day 16, and departure is day 18 (or flight out on day 18 if needed)
    
    # Other cities' days must sum up to days 1-15, plus any flights
    
    # This is complex. Maybe it's better to manually construct the itinerary based on constraints and available flights
    
    # Given the complexity, perhaps a manual solution is more feasible for this problem
    
    # Let's try constructing a possible itinerary manually
    
    # The itinerary must start somewhere. Let's choose a starting city that has flights to others.
    
    # Possible starting cities: Helsinki, Prague, Valencia, Dubrovnik, Porto, Reykjavik
    
    # Let's start with Helsinki.
    
    # Day 1-4: Helsinki (4 days)
    # Then, fly to a connected city: Prague, Reykjavik, or Dubrovnik
    
    # Let's choose Reykjavik.
    # Flight on day 4: Helsinki to Reykjavik (day 4: Helsinki and Reykjavik)
    # Then stay in Reykjavik for 4 days (days 4-7)
    # Then, fly to Prague (Reykjavik and Prague are connected)
    # Flight on day 7: Reykjavik to Prague (day 7: Reykjavik and Prague)
    # Stay in Prague for 3 days (days 7-9)
    # Then, fly to Valencia (Prague and Valencia are connected)
    # Flight on day 9: Prague to Valencia (day 9: Prague and Valencia)
    # Stay in Valencia for 5 days (days 9-13)
    # Then, fly to Porto (Valencia and Porto are connected)
    # Flight on day 13: Valencia to Porto (day 13: Valencia and Porto)
    # But Porto must be days 16-18. This doesn't fit. So this path is invalid.
    
    # Alternative: after Valencia, don't go directly to Porto. But no other flights from Valencia.
    
    # So maybe start with a different city.
    
    # Let's try starting in Dubrovnik.
    # Stay in Dubrovnik for 4 days (days 1-4)
    # Fly to Helsinki (day 4: Dubrovnik and Helsinki)
    # Stay in Helsinki for 4 days (days 4-7)
    # Fly to Reykjavik (day 7: Helsinki and Reykjavik)
    # Stay in Reykjavik for 4 days (days 7-10)
    # Fly to Prague (day 10: Reykjavik and Prague)
    # Stay in Prague for 3 days (days 10-12)
    # Fly to Valencia (day 12: Prague and Valencia)
    # Stay in Valencia for 5 days (days 12-16)
    # Fly to Porto (day 16: Valencia and Porto)
    # Stay in Porto for 3 days (days 16-18)
    
    # Check the days:
    # Dubrovnik: 1-4 (4 days)
    # Helsinki: 4-7 (4 days)
    # Reykjavik: 7-10 (4 days)
    # Prague: 10-12 (3 days) (10,11,12)
    # Valencia: 12-16 (5 days) (12,13,14,15,16)
    # Porto: 16-18 (3 days) (16,17,18)
    
    # Total days: 18.
    # Flight days:
    # Day 4: Dubrovnik and Helsinki
    # Day 7: Helsinki and Reykjavik
    # Day 10: Reykjavik and Prague
    # Day 12: Prague and Valencia
    # Day 16: Valencia and Porto
    
    # All flight connections are direct.
    # Porto is visited on days 16-18, meeting the friend's constraint.
    
    # Now, construct the itinerary in the required JSON format.
