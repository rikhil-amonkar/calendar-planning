    s.add(seville_end == seville_start + 6)      # 7 days
    s.add(manchester_end == manchester_start + 3) # 4 days

    # All start and end days must be within 1-15
    s.add(stuttgart_start >= 1, stuttgart_end <= days)
    s.add(seville_start >= 1, seville_end <= days)
    s.add(manchester_start >= 1, manchester_end <= days)

    # The friend is met in Stuttgart between day 1 and 6
    s.add(stuttgart_start <= 6 - 5)  # since stuttgart_end = stuttgart_start +5, to have some day <=6.

    # No overlapping stays in cities except for flight days (which are handled by being in two cities on the same day)
    # The sequence must be such that the next city's start is either the same day (flight) or after the previous end.

    # Possible sequences: 
    # Option 1: Stuttgart -> Manchester -> Seville -> Manchester (if needed)
    # Or other permutations. But given flight constraints, let's model possible transitions.

    # We need to model the order of visits. Let's assume the order is Stuttgart -> Manchester -> Seville.
    # So:
    s.add(stuttgart_end <= manchester_start)
    s.add(manchester_end <= seville_start)

    # But wait, total days would be 6 (Stuttgart) +4 (Manchester) +7 (Seville) =17, which exceeds 15. So there must be overlapping flight days.
    # Alternatively, perhaps the trip is Stuttgart -> Manchester -> Seville -> Manchester -> Stuttgart, but that complicates.

    # Alternatively, perhaps the trip is Stuttgart (6 days) -> Manchester (4 days, but some overlap with Seville).

    # Let me think differently: the sum of days in cities is 6 +7 +4 =17. But since flight days are counted twice, each flight reduces the total by 1.
    # We have 17 -15 =2, so there must be two flight days (each flight day is counted in two cities, so each flight reduces total by 1).

    # So there must be exactly two flight days.

    # Now, the flight days must be between cities with direct flights: Manchester-Seville and Stuttgart-Manchester.

    # Let's model the two flight days.

    # Suppose the first flight is from Stuttgart to Manchester on day X. Then day X is in both cities.
    # Then the second flight is from Manchester to Seville on day Y.

    # So the itinerary would be:
    # Days 1..X in Stuttgart, then flight to Manchester on X, then days X..Y in Manchester, flight to Seville on Y, days Y..15 in Seville.

    # But let's compute the durations:
    # Stuttgart: X days (1..X)
    # Manchester: Y - X +1 days (since day X is in both, day Y is in both)
    # Seville: 15 - Y +1 days.
    # But the required durations are 6, 4, 7.

    # So X =6 (Stuttgart days 1-6, flight on day6 to Manchester).
    # Then Manchester: Y -6 +1 =4 → Y -5 =4 → Y=9.
    # Seville: 15 -9 +1 =7 days. Which matches.

    # So the itinerary would be:
    # Stuttgart: 1-6 (days 1-6)
    # Flight Stuttgart to Manchester on day6.
    # Manchester: 6-9 (days 6-9)
    # Flight Manchester to Seville on day9.
    # Seville: 9-15 (days 9-15).

    # Check the durations:
    # Stuttgart: 6 days (1-6).
    # Manchester: days 6-9 → 6,7,8,9 →4 days.
    # Seville: days 9-15 →7 days.
    # Total: 6 +4 +7 -2 (flight days counted twice) =15.

    # Also, the friend is met in Stuttgart between day1-6, which is satisfied.

    # Also, flights are between connected cities: Stuttgart-Manchester and Manchester-Seville, which are direct.

    # So this seems to work.

    # Now, model this in Z3.

    # Alternatively, since we've found a valid itinerary manually, perhaps we can just return it.

    # But for the sake of using Z3, let's proceed with the constraints.

    # Let's define the two flight days.
    flight1_day = Int('flight1_day')  # Stuttgart to Manchester
    flight2_day = Int('flight2_day')  # Manchester to Seville

    s.add(flight1_day >= 1, flight1_day <= days)
    s.add(flight2_day >= 1, flight2_day <= days)
    s.add(flight2_day > flight1_day)

    # Stuttgart is from 1 to flight1_day (inclusive)
    s.add(stuttgart_start == 1)
    s.add(stuttgart_end == flight1_day)
    s.add(flight1_day - stuttgart_start + 1 == 6)  # 6 days in Stuttgart

    # Manchester is from flight1_day to flight2_day
    s.add(manchester_start == flight1_day)
    s.add(manchester_end == flight2_day)
    s.add(flight2_day - flight1_day + 1 == 4)  # 4 days in Manchester

    # Seville is from flight2_day to 15
    s.add(seville_start == flight2_day)
    s.add(seville_end == 15)
    s.add(15 - flight2_day + 1 == 7)  # 7 days in Seville
