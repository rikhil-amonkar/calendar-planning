    # But it's complex. Alternatively, we can model the sequence of cities with start and end days.
    
    # Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to model the itinerary as a sequence of stays, with flights in between.
    
    # Let's model the itinerary as a sequence of 'segments', where each segment is a stay in a city.
    # Each segment has a start day, end day, and city.
    # Flights occur between segments.
    
    # However, this is also complex to model in Z3.
