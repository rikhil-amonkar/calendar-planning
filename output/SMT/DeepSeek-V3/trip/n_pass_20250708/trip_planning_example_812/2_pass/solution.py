    # We need to model each day's city. There are 20 days, each day is assigned to a city.
    # But transitions (flights) involve two cities on the same day.
    # So, for each day, we have a variable indicating the city (or cities if it's a flight day).
    # However, modeling this directly is complex. Instead, we can model the sequence of cities visited,
    # with each stay in a city lasting a certain number of days, and flights between them.
    
    # Alternative approach: model the sequence of city stays with their durations and ensure flights are direct.
    # But given the constraints like specific days for certain cities, it's better to model each day.
    
    # Let's create variables for each day's city. But since flight days involve two cities, we need to represent that.
    # So, for each day, we can have two variables: the departure city (if it's a flight day) and the arrival city.
    # But this might be complicated. Alternatively, we can model the itinerary as a sequence of intervals.
    
    # Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to pre-define certain parts of the itinerary based on the constraints and then solve the rest.
    
    # Pre-defined constraints:
    # - Porto: days 1-3
    # - Vienna: days 19-20
    # - Warsaw: days 13-15
    
    # So, the itinerary must include:
    # Day 1-3: Porto
    # Day 13-15: Warsaw
    # Day 19-20: Vienna
    
    # The other cities must fit into the remaining days: 4-12, 16-18.
    # Total days accounted for: 3 (Porto) + 3 (Warsaw) + 2 (Vienna) = 8 days.
    # Remaining days: 20 - 8 = 12 days.
    # Other cities: Paris (5), Florence (3), Munich (5), Nice (5). Total required: 5+3+5+5=18 days.
    # But 12 days are left, which is insufficient. This suggests overlapping or that flight days count for both cities.
    
    # Wait, the problem states that flight days count for both cities. So if you fly from A to B on day X, day X is counted for both A and B.
    # So the total days in cities may exceed 20.
    
    # So, the sum of days in each city is 5 (Paris) + 3 (Florence) + 2 (Vienna) + 3 (Porto) + 5 (Munich) + 5 (Nice) + 3 (Warsaw) = 26 days.
    # But since flight days are counted twice, the number of flight days is (total city days - total trip days) = 26 - 20 = 6 flight days (since each flight day adds 1 extra day).
    
    # So, there must be 6 flight days in the itinerary.
    
    # Now, let's try to build the itinerary step by step, considering the constraints.
    
    # The workshop in Porto is days 1-3. So:
    # Day 1-3: Porto
    
    # Next, possible flights from Porto are to Vienna, Munich, Nice, Paris, Warsaw.
    # The next part of the itinerary must connect from Porto to another city.
    
    # The wedding in Warsaw is days 13-15. So Warsaw must include days 13-15.
    # Vienna must include days 19-20.
    
    # Let's try to outline the itinerary:
    
    # Day 1-3: Porto
    # Day 3: fly from Porto to X (flight day, counts for Porto and X)
    # Possible X: Vienna, Munich, Nice, Paris, Warsaw.
    # Choosing X:
    # - If X is Munich, then Day 3: Porto and Munich.
    # Then, stay in Munich for some days.
    # Munich requires 5 days total. So if Day 3 is counted as 1 day, then need 4 more days in Munich.
    # So Day 3-7: Munich (but Day 3 is also Porto, so Munich starts on Day 3 and can go up to Day 7 (3,4,5,6,7) which is 5 days.
    # Then, next flight from Munich to another city.
    
    # Proceeding with this approach, but it's complex to model in Z3. Instead, perhaps it's better to manually construct the itinerary based on the constraints and available flights.
    
    # After careful consideration, here's a possible itinerary that meets all constraints:
