    # Brussels is days 1-2
    # So other cities must be after or before or overlapping, but with constraints.

    # Total days: Brussels 2, Split 5, Barcelona 7
    # The sum of days in each city is 12 + flight days (since flight days are counted twice)
    # But flight days are counted in both cities, so the total would be 12 + number of flight days.

    # Alternative approach: model the sequence of cities and transitions.

    # Possible sequences:
    # Option 1: Brussels -> Barcelona -> Split -> Barcelona
    # Or Brussels -> Barcelona -> Split (but then Barcelona's days would be split before and after Split, but no direct flights Brussels-Split)
    # Or Brussels -> Barcelona -> Split -> Barcelona -> Brussels (but total days may exceed)

    # So the sequence must be Brussels -> Barcelona -> Split (and possibly back to Barcelona, but not necessary for 12 days)

    # Let's model the possible sequences.

    # We can model the itinerary as a sequence of stays in cities, with flights between them.

    # But given the constraints, let's try to find the ranges.

    # Brussels is days 1-2.

    # Then, the next city must be Barcelona (since no direct flights to Split from Brussels).

    # So from day 3 onwards, it's Barcelona until some day, then fly to Split.

    # Then, from Split, fly back to Barcelona (since no other direct flights).

    # So the sequence is:
    # Brussels 1-2
    # Barcelona a-b (where a >=3, a <= b)
    # Split c-d (c = b+0 or b+1? Flight day is counted in both cities)
    # Then Barcelona e-f (e = d+0 or d+1)

    # Total days:
    # Brussels: 2 days (1-2)
    # Barcelona: (b - a + 1) + (f - e + 1) + possibly 1 for flight day if b+1 = c (flight day from Barcelona to Split is day b and c)
    # Split: d - c + 1

    # Total days must be 12, considering flight days are counted in both cities.

    # Let's set:
    # Brussels: 1-2
    # Barcelona: 3-x
    # Split: x+1 - y (since flight from Barcelona to Split is day x and x+1)
    # Barcelona: y+1 - 12

    # Then:
    # Days in Brussels: 2
    # Days in Barcelona: (x - 3 + 1) + (12 - (y+1) + 1) = (x - 2) + (12 - y) = x - 2 + 12 - y = x - y + 10
    # But the flight day x is counted in Barcelona, x+1 in Split. So Barcelona's days include x, Split's include x+1.
    # Similarly, flight from Split to Barcelona: day y is in Split, y+1 in Barcelona.
    # So Barcelona's days are 3 to x (x - 3 + 1 = x - 2 days) and y+1 to 12 (12 - (y+1) + 1 = 12 - y days). Total Barcelona days: x - 2 + 12 - y = x - y + 10.
    # Split's days: x+1 to y (y - (x+1) + 1 = y - x days.

    # Total days in cities: 2 (Brussels) + (x - y + 10) (Barcelona) + (y - x) (Split) = 12.

    # So 2 + x - y + 10 + y - x = 12 → 12 = 12. This holds, but the individual city days must match the required.

    # Required: Barcelona 7 days: x - y + 10 = 7 → x - y = -3 → y = x + 3.
    # Split: 5 days: y - x = 5 → but y = x +3 → x +3 -x =5 → 3=5. Contradiction.

    # So this sequence doesn't work.

    # Alternative sequence: Brussels 1-2, Barcelona 3-3 (1 day), fly to Split on day 3 (counted in both). Then Split 3-7 (5 days), then fly back to Barcelona on day 7 (counted in both), Barcelona 7-12 (6 days).

    # Total days:
    # Brussels: 2 (1-2)
    # Barcelona: 3 (day 3) + 6 (days 7-12) = 9 days. But flight days are counted twice. So day 3 is in Barcelona and Split. So Barcelona's days are day 3, and days 7-12: 1 + 6 = 7 days (correct).
    # Split: day 3 to 7: 5 days (3,4,5,6,7) → correct.
    # Total calendar days: day 1-12: 12 days.

    # This seems to meet all constraints.

    # So the itinerary is:
    # Brussels: 1-2
    # Barcelona: 3 (flight to Split)
    # Split: 3-7 (5 days)
    # Barcelona: 7-12 (6 days)

    # Now, we need to represent this in the required JSON format.
