We'll use the Z3 solver to model the problem and find a feasible schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, and the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The arrival time at North Beach is fixed at 9:00 AM.\n   - The meeting with James must occur within his availability (12:45 PM to 2:00 PM) and last at least 75 minutes.\n   - The meeting with Robert must occur within his availability (12:45 PM to 3:15 PM) and last at least 30 minutes.\n   - Account for travel times between locations to ensure you can reach each friend on time.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of meetings (both James and Robert) while satisfying all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    # James is available at Mission District from 12:45 PM (765 minutes) to 2:00 PM (840 minutes)\n    james_start_avail = 765  # 12:45 PM in minutes since midnight\n    james_end_avail = 840     # 2:00 PM in minutes since midnight\n    # Robert is available at The Castro from 12:45 PM (765) to 3:15 PM (915 minutes)\n    robert_start_avail = 765  # 12:45 PM\n    robert_end_avail = 915     # 3:15 PM\n\n    # Meeting durations in minutes\n    james_min_duration = 75\n    robert_min_duration = 30\n\n    # Travel times (in minutes)\n    # From North Beach to Mission District: 18\n    nb_to_md = 18\n    # From North Beach to The Castro: 22\n    nb_to_castro = 22\n    # From Mission District to The Castro: 7\n    md_to_castro = 7\n    # From The Castro to Mission District: 7\n    castro_to_md = 7\n    # From Mission District to North Beach: 17\n    md_to_nb = 17\n    # From The Castro to North Beach: 20\n    castro_to_nb = 20\n\n    # Variables for meeting start times and durations\n    # We need to decide the order of meetings: James first or Robert first, or only one.\n\n    # Possible scenarios:\n    # 1.

Constraints ensure meetings fit within the friends' availability and account for travel times.\n2. **Scenarios**: The code checks two scenarios:\n   - Meeting James first, then traveling to meet Robert.\n   - Meeting Robert first, then traveling to meet James.\n3. **Feasibility Check**: The Z3 solver checks if either scenario is feasible. If not, it checks if meeting just one friend is possible.\n4. **Output**: The solution prints the feasible schedule, detailing the meeting times and travel, or indicates if no feasible schedule exists.\n\nThis approach systematically explores possible schedules while adhering to all constraints, ensuring an optimal solution is found if one exists."
