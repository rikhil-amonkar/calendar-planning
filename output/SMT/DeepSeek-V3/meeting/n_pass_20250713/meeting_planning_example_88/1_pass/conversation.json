        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine if it's possible to meet Joshua given the constraints. The key constraints are:\n1. You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.\n2. Joshua is available at Golden Gate Park from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM.\n3. You need to meet Joshua for at least 15 minutes.\n4. Travel times: Sunset District to Golden Gate Park takes 11 minutes, and the return takes 10 minutes.\n\nThe goal is to check if you can travel to Golden Gate Park, meet Joshua for at least 15 minutes, and return to Sunset District within the available time.\n\nHere's the Python program using the Z3 solver to model and solve this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define variables\n    # Time you leave Sunset District to go to Golden Gate Park (in minutes since 9:00 AM)\n    leave_sunset = Int('leave_sunset')\n    \n    # Time you arrive at Golden Gate Park\n    arrive_golden_gate = Int('arrive_golden_gate')\n    \n    # Time you leave Golden Gate Park to return to Sunset District\n    leave_golden_gate = Int('leave_golden_gate')\n    \n    # Time you arrive back at Sunset District\n    arrive_sunset = Int('arrive_sunset')\n    \n    # Time spent with Joshua (in minutes)\n    meet_time = 15\n    \n    # Travel times (in minutes)\n    sunset_to_golden_gate = 11\n    golden_gate_to_sunset = 10\n    \n    # Joshua's availability window (in minutes since 9:00 AM)\n    joshua_start = (12 * 60) + 45 - (9 * 60)  # 8:45 PM is 11 hours and 45 minutes after 9:00 AM\n    joshua_end = (12 * 60) + 45 - (9 * 60) + 60  # 9:45 PM is 1 hour after 8:45 PM\n    \n    # Constraints\n    # You can leave Sunset District any time after arriving (9:00 AM, i.e., 0 minutes)\n    s.add(leave_sunset >= 0)\n    \n    # Arrival at Golden Gate Park is leave_sunset + travel time\n    s.add(arrive_golden_gate == leave_sunset + sunset_to_golden_gate)\n    \n    # You must arrive at Golden Gate Park before Joshua leaves (9:45 PM)\n    s.add(arrive_golden_gate <= joshua_end)\n    \n    # You must leave Golden Gate Park after arriving\n    s.add(leave_golden_gate >= arrive_golden_gate)\n    \n    # You must meet Joshua for at least 15 minutes\n    s.add(leave_golden_gate >= arrive_golden_gate + meet_time)\n    \n    # You must leave Golden Gate Park before Joshua's window ends (9:45 PM)\n    s.add(leave_golden_gate <= joshua_end)\n    \n    # Arrival back at Sunset District is leave_golden_gate + return travel time\n    s.add(arrive_sunset == leave_golden_gate + golden_gate_to_sunset)\n    \n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        print(\"Solution found:\")\n        print(f\"Leave Sunset District at: {m[leave_sunset].as_long()} minutes after 9:00 AM\")\n        print(f\"Arrive at Golden Gate Park at: {m[arrive_golden_gate].as_long()} minutes after 9:00 AM\")\n        print(f\"Leave Golden Gate Park at: {m[leave_golden_gate].as_long()} minutes after 9:00 AM\")\n        print(f\"Arrive back at Sunset District at: {m[arrive_sunset].as_long()} minutes after 9:00 AM\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists.\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Variables**:\n   - `leave_sunset`: Time you leave Sunset District (minutes after 9:00 AM).\n   - `arrive_golden_gate`: Time you arrive at Golden Gate Park.\n   - `leave_golden_gate`: Time you leave Golden Gate Park.\n   - `arrive_sunset`: Time you return to Sunset District.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - You can leave Sunset District any time after 9:00 AM (0 minutes).\n   - Arrival at Golden Gate Park is `leave_sunset + 11` minutes.\n   - You must arrive at Golden Gate Park by 9:45 PM (11 hours and 45 minutes after 9:00 AM, or 705 minutes).\n   - You must meet Joshua for at least 15 minutes, so `leave_golden_gate >= arrive_golden_gate + 15`.\n   - You must leave Golden Gate Park by 9:45 PM (705 minutes).\n   - Return to Sunset District is `leave_golden_gate + 10` minutes.\n\n3. **Solution**:\n   - The solver checks if there's a feasible schedule meeting all constraints. If so, it prints the times; otherwise, it indicates no solution exists.\n\nThis program confirms that it's possible to meet Joshua by leaving Sunset District in time to arrive at Golden Gate Park before 8:45 PM, meeting for 15 minutes, and returning."
