Let me think of a better way to model the sequence of meetings.\n\nAn alternative approach is to define the order of meetings and ensure that each meeting's start time is after the previous meeting's end time plus travel time between locations.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n1. Define variables for the start and end times of each possible meeting.\n2. For each friend, if they are met, their meeting must fit within their availability and duration.\n3. The first meeting must start after 9:00 AM plus travel time from Sunset District to their location.\n4. Subsequent meetings must start after the previous meeting's end time plus travel time between locations.\n5. The objective is to maximize the number of friends met.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    s = Optimize()\n\n    # Convert times to minutes since midnight\n    def time_to_minutes(h, m):\n        return h * 60 + m\n\n    friends = {\n        'Kevin': {\n            'location': 'Alamo Square',\n            'start': time_to_minutes(8, 15),  #

The output will show the optimal schedule if one exists.\n\n**Note**: The code may take some time to run due to the complexity of the constraints. The output will indicate the number of friends that can be met and their respective meeting times."
