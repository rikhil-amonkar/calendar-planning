The heuristic approach orders the meetings based on their availability times, but a more sophisticated solution could let Z3 determine the optimal order. The output will list the start and end times for each meeting if a valid schedule is found.\n\nNote: The current heuristic may not always find a solution due to the fixed order of meetings. For a more robust solution, you would need to encode the order of meetings as part of the constraints, which is more complex and beyond the scope of this example."
