        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the best schedule that allows you to meet Daniel for at least 75 minutes, given the travel times and the time constraints. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - You start at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM.\n   - Daniel is available at Richmond District from 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM (which is a 75-minute window).\n   - You need to meet Daniel for at least 75 minutes, which means you must be present for his entire available window.\n   - The travel time from Russian Hill to Richmond District is 14 minutes, and the return trip takes 13 minutes.\n\n2. **Key Observations**:\n   - To meet Daniel for the entire 75 minutes, you must arrive at Richmond District by 7:00 PM and leave at 8:15 PM.\n   - You need to account for the travel time from Russian Hill to Richmond District (14 minutes). Therefore, you must leave Russian Hill by 6:46 PM to arrive at Richmond District by 7:00 PM.\n   - After meeting Daniel, you can return to Russian Hill, which takes 13 minutes, arriving back by 8:28 PM.\n\n3. **Z3 Solver Approach**:\n   - We can model this problem using the Z3 solver to ensure the constraints are met. However, given the simplicity of the problem, the solution is straightforward without needing complex constraints. The Z3 solver can be used to verify the feasibility of the schedule.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Variables representing the times in minutes since 9:00 AM\n    leave_russian_hill = Int('leave_russian_hill')  # Time to leave Russian Hill\n    arrive_richmond = Int('arrive_richmond')        # Time to arrive at Richmond\n    leave_richmond = Int('leave_richmond')          # Time to leave Richmond\n    arrive_back_russian_hill = Int('arrive_back_russian_hill')  # Time to return to Russian Hill\n\n    # Travel times in minutes\n    travel_to_richmond = 14\n    travel_back_russian = 13\n\n    # Daniel's availability: 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM is 600 to 675 minutes since 9:00 AM (10 hours = 600 mins, 11.25 hours = 675 mins)\n    daniel_start = 600  # 7:00 PM is 10 hours after 9:00 AM\n    daniel_end = 675    # 8:15 PM is 11.25 hours after 9:00 AM\n\n    # Constraints\n    # 1. You must leave Russian Hill after or at 9:00 AM (time >= 0)\n    s.add(leave_russian_hill >= 0)\n    # 2. Arrival at Richmond is leave_russian_hill + travel time\n    s.add(arrive_richmond == leave_russian_hill + travel_to_richmond)\n    # 3. You must arrive at Richmond by 7:00 PM (daniel_start)\n    s.add(arrive_richmond <= daniel_start)\n    # 4. You must leave Richmond at or after 8:15 PM (daniel_end)\n    s.add(leave_richmond >= daniel_end)\n    # 5. Time spent with Daniel is at least 75 minutes (daniel_end - arrive_richmond >= 75)\n    # But since Daniel's window is exactly 75 minutes, and you must be there for the entire window, this is already enforced by constraints 3 and 4.\n    # 6. Return trip: arrive_back_russian_hill = leave_richmond + travel_back_russian\n    s.add(arrive_back_russian_hill == leave_richmond + travel_back_russian)\n\n    # Check if the constraints are satisfiable\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        print(\"Feasible schedule found:\")\n        print(f\"Leave Russian Hill at: {m[leave_russian_hill].as_long()} minutes after 9:00 AM\")\n        print(f\"Arrive at Richmond at: {m[arrive_richmond].as_long()} minutes after 9:00 AM\")\n        print(f\"Leave Richmond at: {m[leave_richmond].as_long()} minutes after 9:00 AM\")\n        print(f\"Arrive back at Russian Hill at: {m[arrive_back_russian_hill].as_long()} minutes after 9:00 AM\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No feasible schedule found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Variables**: The variables represent the times (in minutes since 9:00 AM) for leaving Russian Hill, arriving at Richmond, leaving Richmond, and returning to Russian Hill.\n- **Constraints**: \n  - You must leave Russian Hill after 9:00 AM (time >= 0).\n  - The arrival time at Richmond is the departure time from Russian Hill plus the travel time (14 minutes).\n  - You must arrive at Richmond by 7:00 PM (600 minutes after 9:00 AM).\n  - You must leave Richmond at or after 8:15 PM (675 minutes after 9:00 AM).\n  - The return time to Russian Hill is the departure time from Richmond plus the return travel time (13 minutes).\n- **Solution**: The Z3 solver checks if these constraints can be satisfied. If yes, it prints the feasible schedule; otherwise, it indicates no feasible schedule exists. In this case, the solver will find a valid schedule where you leave Russian Hill by 6:46 PM (586 minutes after 9:00 AM), arrive at Richmond by 7:00 PM, leave at 8:15 PM, and return to Russian Hill by 8:28 PM."
