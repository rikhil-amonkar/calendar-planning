        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal times to meet each friend while respecting the travel times between locations and the time constraints for each meeting. We'll use the Z3 solver to model this as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: For each friend, we'll define variables for the start and end times of the meeting, ensuring they fit within the friend's availability window.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - Each meeting must last at least the minimum required time.\n   - Travel time between consecutive meetings must be accounted for.\n   - Meetings cannot overlap.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (or ensure all are met if possible).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    #

Constraints ensure meetings fit within availability windows and last the required duration.\n4. **Travel Constraints**: The solver ensures sufficient time is allocated for travel between consecutive meetings, starting from the initial location (Richmond District at 9:00 AM).\n5. **Solution Check**: The solver checks for a feasible schedule. If found, it prints the meeting times; otherwise, it indicates no feasible schedule exists.\n\nThis approach leverages the Z3 solver to handle the complex constraints, ensuring an optimal schedule that meets all requirements."
