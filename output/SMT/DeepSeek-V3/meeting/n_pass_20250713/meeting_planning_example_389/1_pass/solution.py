    # Initial location is Haight-Ashbury at time 0.
    # We need to model the sequence of meetings with travel times.

    # Possible meetings: Sarah, Mary, Helen, Thomas. We need to order them and account for travel times.
    # To model this, we can use a sequence of meetings and enforce travel times between them.
    # However, since the number of meetings is small (4), we can consider all possible permutations of the meetings and check feasibility.

    # Alternatively, we can use auxiliary variables to represent the order and enforce constraints based on that.
    # But for simplicity, let's assume we can meet all four friends and find a feasible schedule.

    # Define the order variables: for example, the order in which meetings are attended.
    # But since Z3 doesn't directly support permutations, we can model the relative order with constraints.

    # Let's assume the following order: Mary -> Sarah -> Thomas -> Helen.
    # We need to ensure that the end time of Mary + travel time to Sarah's location <= Sarah's start time, etc.

    # Travel times:
    # From Haight-Ashbury to Mary's location (Richmond District): 10 minutes.
    # From Richmond District to Fisherman's Wharf: 18 minutes.
    # From Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26 minutes.
    # From Bayview to Mission District: 13 minutes.

    # So the sequence is:
    # Start at Haight-Ashbury at 0.
    # Travel to Richmond District (10 minutes), meet Mary.
    # After Mary, travel to Fisherman's Wharf (18 minutes), meet Sarah.
    # After Sarah, travel to Bayview (26 minutes), meet Thomas.
    # After Thomas, travel to Mission District (13 minutes), meet Helen.

    # Now, model this sequence with constraints.

    # Start at Haight-Ashbury at time 0.
    # Arrive at Richmond District at time 10.
    s.add(mary_start >= 10)  # Can't start meeting Mary before arriving at 10 minutes.

    # End meeting Mary at mary_end. Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf: 18 minutes.
    s.add(sarah_start >= mary_end + 18)

    # End meeting Sarah at sarah_end. Travel to Bayview: 26 minutes.
    s.add(thomas_start >= sarah_end + 26)

    # End meeting Thomas at thomas_end. Travel to Mission District: 13 minutes.
    s.add(helen_start >= thomas_end + 13)

    # Check if all meetings can be scheduled in this order.
