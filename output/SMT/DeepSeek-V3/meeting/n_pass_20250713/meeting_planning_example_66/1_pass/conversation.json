        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal times to meet Robert while adhering to the given constraints. The goal is to maximize the time spent with Robert, ensuring at least 120 minutes of meeting time, while considering travel times between locations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: We need to define variables for the start and end times of the meeting with Robert. These times must be within Robert's availability window (11:15 AM to 5:45 PM).\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The meeting duration must be at least 120 minutes.\n   - The travel time from Nob Hill to Presidio is 17 minutes, so the earliest you can arrive at Presidio is 9:00 AM + 17 minutes = 9:17 AM. However, Robert is only available from 11:15 AM, so the meeting must start no earlier than 11:15 AM.\n   - The meeting must end by 5:45 PM, and you need to account for the travel time back to Nob Hill if necessary (though this isn't a constraint for the meeting itself).\n3. **Objective**: Since the goal is to meet Robert for as long as possible within his availability, we can maximize the meeting duration, which is naturally constrained by his availability window.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Convert times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    # Robert's availability: 11:15 AM to 5:45 PM\n    robert_start = (11 * 60 + 15) - (9 * 60)  # 135 minutes after 9:00 AM\n    robert_end = (17 * 60 + 45) - (9 * 60)    # 525 minutes after 9:00 AM\n\n    # Variables for meeting start and end times (relative to 9:00 AM)\n    meeting_start = Int('meeting_start')\n    meeting_end = Int('meeting_end')\n\n    # Constraints\n    # Meeting must start within Robert's availability\n    s.add(meeting_start >= robert_start)\n    s.add(meeting_start <= robert_end - 120)  # Ensure at least 120 minutes meeting\n\n    # Meeting must end within Robert's availability\n    s.add(meeting_end >= meeting_start + 120)\n    s.add(meeting_end <= robert_end)\n\n    # Travel time to Presidio is 17 minutes, but since we start at Nob Hill at 0 minutes (9:00 AM),\n    # we must arrive at Presidio by meeting_start. So, meeting_start >= 17.\n    # But Robert's availability starts at 135, so this is already covered.\n\n    # Maximize the meeting duration (which is meeting_end - meeting_start)\n    # Since the minimum is 120, we can try to maximize it up to robert_end - meeting_start\n    # But since the constraints enforce at least 120, any solution meeting that is acceptable.\n    # However, to get the maximum possible meeting time, we can set the objective to maximize (meeting_end - meeting_start)\n    # But since the problem asks to meet for at least 120 minutes, and doesn't specify to maximize beyond that,\n    # we can just find any solution meeting the constraints.\n\n    # Check if the constraints are satisfiable\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start = m[meeting_start].as_long()\n        end = m[meeting_end].as_long()\n        duration = end - start\n\n        # Convert back to time strings\n        def to_time(minutes):\n            total_minutes = 9 * 60 + minutes\n            hours = total_minutes // 60\n            mins = total_minutes % 60\n            return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\n        start_time = to_time(start)\n        end_time = to_time(end)\n        print(f\"SOLUTION: Meet Robert from {start_time} to {end_time} (duration: {duration} minutes)\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No valid schedule found.\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The script converts all times into minutes relative to 9:00 AM for easier arithmetic. For instance, 11:15 AM becomes 135 minutes (since 11:15 AM is 2 hours and 15 minutes after 9:00 AM).\n2. **Variables and Constraints**: The meeting start and end times are defined as integer variables. The constraints ensure that:\n   - The meeting starts no earlier than 11:15 AM (Robert's availability start).\n   - The meeting duration is at least 120 minutes.\n   - The meeting ends by 5:45 PM (Robert's availability end).\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If the solver finds a valid solution, it converts the meeting start and end times back to a readable format and prints the schedule. The solution ensures that you meet Robert for at least 120 minutes within his available window.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem using Z3's constraint-solving capabilities to find a feasible meeting schedule."
