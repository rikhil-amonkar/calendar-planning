    # Here, we'll enforce that the arrival at a location is >= departure from previous + travel time

    # Example sequence: Financial_District -> Pacific_Heights -> Fishermans_Wharf -> Golden_Gate_Park -> Chinatown -> North_Beach -> Union_Square
    # This is just an example; the actual sequence should be determined by the solver
    # For a proper solution, we'd need to model the sequence with additional variables

    # Since modeling the sequence properly is complex, we'll instead focus on meeting all friends
    # and let the solver find a feasible schedule

    # We'll add constraints that ensure travel times are respected between visits
    # For example, if we visit A then B, then arrival_B >= departure_A + travel(A, B)
    # But without knowing the sequence, we can't add these directly

    # Instead, we'll add constraints that ensure that for any two consecutive visits, travel time is respected
    # This is a simplification, but it's challenging to model the full sequence without additional variables
