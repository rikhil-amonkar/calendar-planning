        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal times to meet each friend while respecting the travel times between locations and the constraints on meeting durations. We'll use the Z3 solver to model this as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, as well as the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - Ensure that each meeting duration meets the minimum required time.\n   - Ensure that the start time of each meeting is within the friend's availability window.\n   - Account for travel times between locations when scheduling consecutive meetings.\n   - Ensure that the meetings do not overlap in time.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (in this case, it's possible to meet all three, so the objective is to find a feasible schedule).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the locations\n    locations = ['Fishermans_Wharf', 'Golden_Gate_Park', 'Presidio', 'Richmond_District']\n    \n    # Define the travel times (in minutes) as a dictionary of dictionaries\n    travel_times = {\n        'Fishermans_Wharf': {\n            'Golden_Gate_Park': 25,\n            'Presidio': 17,\n            'Richmond_District': 18\n        },\n        'Golden_Gate_Park': {\n            'Fishermans_Wharf': 24,\n            'Presidio': 11,\n            'Richmond_District': 7\n        },\n        'Presidio': {\n            'Fishermans_Wharf': 19,\n            'Golden_Gate_Park': 12,\n            'Richmond_District': 7\n        },\n        'Richmond_District': {\n            'Fishermans_Wharf': 18,\n            'Golden_Gate_Park': 9,\n            'Presidio': 7\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    # Melissa's availability: 8:30 AM (510) to 8:00 PM (1200)\n    melissa_start_avail = 510  # 8:30 AM in minutes since midnight\n    melissa_end_avail = 1200    # 8:00 PM in minutes since midnight\n    melissa_min_duration = 15   # minutes\n\n    # Nancy's availability: 7:45 PM (1185) to 10:00 PM (1320)\n    nancy_start_avail = 1185    # 7:45 PM in minutes since midnight\n    nancy_end_avail = 1320      # 10:00 PM in minutes since midnight\n    nancy_min_duration = 105    # minutes\n\n    # Emily's availability: 4:45 PM (1005) to 10:00 PM (1320)\n    emily_start_avail = 1005    # 4:45 PM in minutes since midnight\n    emily_end_avail = 1320      # 10:00 PM in minutes since midnight\n    emily_min_duration = 120    # minutes\n\n    # Current time starts at 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight) at Fisherman's Wharf\n    current_time = 540\n    current_location = 'Fishermans_Wharf'\n\n    # Variables for meeting start and end times\n    meet_melissa_start = Int('meet_melissa_start')\n    meet_melissa_end = Int('meet_melissa_end')\n    meet_nancy_start = Int('meet_nancy_start')\n    meet_nancy_end = Int('meet_nancy_end')\n    meet_emily_start = Int('meet_emily_start')\n    meet_emily_end = Int('meet_emily_end')\n\n    # Constraints for Melissa\n    s.add(meet_melissa_start >= melissa_start_avail)\n    s.add(meet_melissa_end <= melissa_end_avail)\n    s.add(meet_melissa_end - meet_melissa_start >= melissa_min_duration)\n\n    # Constraints for Nancy\n    s.add(meet_nancy_start >= nancy_start_avail)\n    s.add(meet_nancy_end <= nancy_end_avail)\n    s.add(meet_nancy_end - meet_nancy_start >= nancy_min_duration)\n\n    # Constraints for Emily\n    s.add(meet_emily_start >= emily_start_avail)\n    s.add(meet_emily_end <= emily_end_avail)\n    s.add(meet_emily_end - meet_emily_start >= emily_min_duration)\n\n    # Order of meetings and travel times\n    # We need to decide the order in which to meet the friends.
