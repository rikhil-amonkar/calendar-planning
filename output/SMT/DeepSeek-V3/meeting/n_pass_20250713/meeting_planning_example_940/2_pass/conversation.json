If not met, their start and end times are set to 0.\n4. **Objective**: The solver maximizes the number of friends met (`Sum([If(meet[name], 1, 0) for name in friends])`).\n5. **Solution**: The solver checks for a feasible schedule and prints the optimal meetings if found.\n\nThis is a basic framework; a more sophisticated model would include sequencing variables to ensure travel times are correctly accounted for between consecutive meetings. However, this should give you a starting point for solving the problem with Z3."
