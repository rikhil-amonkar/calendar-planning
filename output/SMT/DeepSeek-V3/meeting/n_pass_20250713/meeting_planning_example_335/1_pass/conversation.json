It then uses Z3 to find a schedule where all meetings can be accommodated, considering travel times. The solution prints the optimal schedule if one exists. \n\nThe output will show the start and end times for each meeting, ensuring that all constraints are met. The schedule is optimized to meet all friends if possible, given the constraints. If no valid schedule exists, it will indicate that as well.\n\nNote: The actual output will depend on the solver's findings, but the code is structured to find a feasible schedule that meets all constraints."
