        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the best schedule that allows us to meet Kenneth for at least 90 minutes while considering the travel time between locations. The key is to ensure that we are at Nob Hill during Kenneth's availability window (2:15 PM to 7:45 PM) and account for the travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the start and end times of the meeting with Kenneth, ensuring the meeting duration is at least 90 minutes.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start and end within Kenneth's availability window (2:15 PM to 7:45 PM).\n   - The meeting duration must be at least 90 minutes.\n   - We must arrive at Nob Hill by the meeting start time, considering the travel time from Fisherman's Wharf (11 minutes).\n3. **Objective**: Since the goal is to meet Kenneth for as long as possible, we can maximize the meeting duration (though the minimum is 90 minutes, we can aim for the maximum possible within his availability).\n\n### Solution Code:\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling_problem():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    # Kenneth's availability: 2:15 PM to 7:45 PM\n    # 2:15 PM is 14*60 + 15 = 855 minutes since midnight, so 855 - 540 = 315 minutes since 9:00 AM\n    # 7:45 PM is 19*60 + 45 = 1185 minutes since midnight, so 1185 - 540 = 645 minutes since 9:00 AM\n    kenneth_start_min = 315  # 2:15 PM relative to 9:00 AM\n    kenneth_end_min = 645    # 7:45 PM relative to 9:00 AM\n\n    # Meeting start and end times (relative to 9:00 AM)\n    meeting_start = Int('meeting_start')\n    meeting_end = Int('meeting_end')\n\n    # Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes\n    travel_time = 11\n\n    # Constraints\n    # 1. Meeting must start and end within Kenneth's availability\n    s.add(meeting_start >= kenneth_start_min)\n    s.add(meeting_end <= kenneth_end_min)\n    # 2. Meeting duration must be at least 90 minutes\n    s.add(meeting_end - meeting_start >= 90)\n    # 3. Must arrive at Nob Hill by meeting_start, leaving Fisherman's Wharf at (meeting_start - travel_time)\n    # Since we start at Fisherman's Wharf at time 0 (9:00 AM), the earliest we can leave is time 0.\n    s.add(meeting_start - travel_time >= 0)\n\n    # Check if the constraints are satisfiable\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start = m[meeting_start].as_long()\n        end = m[meeting_end].as_long()\n        duration = end - start\n\n        # Convert times back to HH:MM format\n        def to_time_str(minutes):\n            total_minutes = 540 + minutes  # 9:00 AM is 540 minutes\n            hours = total_minutes // 60\n            mins = total_minutes % 60\n            return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n\n        start_time = to_time_str(start)\n        end_time = to_time_str(end)\n        travel_departure_time = to_time_str(start - travel_time)\n\n        print(f\"Optimal meeting schedule:\")\n        print(f\"Leave Fisherman's Wharf at: {travel_departure_time}\")\n        print(f\"Arrive at Nob Hill by: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"Meet Kenneth from: {start_time} to {end_time} (Duration: {duration} minutes)\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No feasible schedule found.\")\n\nsolve_scheduling_problem()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Time Conversion**: All times are converted to minutes relative to 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight) for easier arithmetic.\n2. **Variables**: `meeting_start` and `meeting_end` represent the start and end times of the meeting with Kenneth.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must occur within Kenneth's availability window (2:15 PM to 7:45 PM).\n   - The meeting duration must be at least 90 minutes.\n   - The departure from Fisherman's Wharf must be early enough to arrive at Nob Hill by the meeting start time (accounting for the 11-minute travel time).\n4. **Solution**: The solver checks for a feasible schedule. If found, it prints the departure time from Fisherman's Wharf, the arrival time at Nob Hill, and the meeting duration with Kenneth.\n\nThis approach ensures that we meet Kenneth for at least 90 minutes while respecting the travel constraints. The solution can be adjusted if additional friends or locations are added."
