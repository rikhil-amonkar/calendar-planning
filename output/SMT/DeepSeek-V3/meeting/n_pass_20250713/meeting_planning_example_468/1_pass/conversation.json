        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find an optimal schedule that allows meeting as many friends as possible while respecting the time constraints and travel times between locations. We'll use the Z3 solver to model this as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting with friends. Also, define boolean variables to indicate whether a meeting with a friend is scheduled or not.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Time Windows**: Each meeting must occur within the friend's available time window.\n   - **Duration**: Each meeting must last at least 90 minutes.\n   - **Travel Time**: Ensure sufficient time is allocated for traveling between locations if consecutive meetings are scheduled.\n   - **No Overlap**: Meetings should not overlap in time, considering travel times.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (i.e., maximize the sum of boolean variables indicating whether a meeting is scheduled).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    #

Constraints ensure meetings fit within time windows and last at least 90 minutes.\n3. **Travel Constraints**: For each pair of friends, if both are met, their meetings must not overlap considering the travel time between their locations.\n4. **Objective**: The solver maximizes the number of friends met. The solution is printed if found, showing the optimal schedule with meeting times converted back to a readable format.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem using Z3's constraint-solving capabilities to find an optimal schedule that meets as many friends as possible while respecting all constraints."
