The solution considers both possible orders of visiting friends (Financial District first or Alamo Square first) and finds the one that allows meeting both friends for the required durations while respecting travel times.\n\nThe optimal schedule will be printed, showing the sequence of movements and meeting times. The solution ensures that:\n1. You meet Stephanie for at least 90 minutes during her availability (8:15AM-11:30AM)\n2. You meet John for at least 30 minutes during his availability (10:15AM-8:45PM)\n3. All travel times between locations are accounted for\n4. The schedule starts at 9:00AM from Embarcadero"
