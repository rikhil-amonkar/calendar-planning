Helen will be at North Beach from 7:00AM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Kimberly will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:30PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 45 minutes. Patricia will be at Bayview from 6:00PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The goal is to maximize the time spent with each friend within their available windows, ensuring the minimum required meeting times are met.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, and the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - Ensure meetings start and end within the friends' availability windows.\n   - Allocate the minimum required meeting time for each friend.\n   - Account for travel time between locations.\n   - Ensure no overlaps in meetings (i.e., you can't be in two places at once).\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the total time spent with friends (or ensure all minimum times are met).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables for meeting start and end times\n    # Helen at North Beach\n    helen_start = Int('helen_start')  # in minutes since 9:00 AM\n    helen_end = Int('helen_end')\n    \n    # Kimberly at Fisherman's Wharf\n    kimberly_start = Int('kimberly_start')\n    kimberly_end = Int('kimberly_end')\n    \n    # Patricia at Bayview\n    patricia_start = Int('patricia_start')\n    patricia_end = Int('patricia_end')\n\n    # Travel times (in minutes)\n    # From Nob Hill to North Beach: 8 minutes\n    # From North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: 5 minutes\n    # From Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26 minutes\n\n    # Convert friends' availability windows to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    # Helen: 7:00 AM to 4:45 PM\n    # Since we start at 9:00 AM, Helen's window is from -120 to 465 minutes (since 7:00 AM is 2 hours before 9:00 AM)\n    helen_available_start = -120  # 7:00 AM is 120 minutes before 9:00 AM\n    helen_available_end = 465      # 4:45 PM is 7 hours and 45 minutes after 9:00 AM (7*60 + 45 = 465)\n\n    # Kimberly: 4:30 PM to 9:00 PM\n    kimberly_available_start = 450  # 4:30 PM is 7.5 hours after 9:00 AM (7*60 + 30 = 450)\n    kimberly_available_end = 720     # 9:00 PM is 12 hours after 9:00 AM (12*60 = 720)\n\n    # Patricia: 6:00 PM to 9:15 PM\n    patricia_available_start = 540   # 6:00 PM is 9 hours after 9:00 AM (9*60 = 540)\n    patricia_available_end = 735     # 9:15 PM is 12 hours and 15 minutes after 9:00 AM (12*60 + 15 = 735)\n\n    # Minimum meeting times\n    helen_min_time = 120\n    kimberly_min_time = 45\n    patricia_min_time = 120\n\n    # Constraints for Helen\n    s.add(helen_start >= helen_available_start)\n    s.add(helen_end <= helen_available_end)\n    s.add(helen_end -

Each meeting must start and end within the friend's availability window.\n   - Each meeting must last at least the minimum required time.\n   - Travel times between locations are accounted for between consecutive meetings.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If the solver finds a valid schedule, it converts the minutes from 9:00 AM into a readable time format and prints the schedule.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are met, and the schedule is feasible, allowing you to meet all friends for the required durations while accounting for travel times."
