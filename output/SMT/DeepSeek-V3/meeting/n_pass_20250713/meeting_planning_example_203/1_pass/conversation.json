The constraints ensure that each meeting starts only after the previous one ends plus the required travel time.\n3. **Time Windows**: Each meeting must fit within the friend's available time window and last at least the minimum required duration.\n4. **Output**: If a valid schedule is found, it prints the start and end times for each meeting in a human-readable format.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are met, and the schedule is optimized to meet all friends within their available times."
