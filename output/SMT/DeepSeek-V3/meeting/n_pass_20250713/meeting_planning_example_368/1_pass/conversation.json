We'll create a list of all possible meeting sequences and check feasibility for each.\n    # However, this is computationally expensive, so instead, we'll use auxiliary variables to represent the order.\n\n    #

We'll create variables to represent the order and enforce travel times between consecutive meetings.\n\n    # This is complex, so instead, we'll use a heuristic approach where we try to schedule meetings in a way that maximizes the number of meetings.\n\n    # For Z3, we can model the problem by allowing the solver to choose which meetings to attend, and enforce that the schedule is feasible.\n\n    # We'll create a variable for the start time of the day (arrival_time is 540).\n    # Then, for each possible meeting, we'll add constraints that the meeting starts after the arrival time plus travel time if it's the first meeting, or after the previous meeting's end plus travel time.\n\n    # To model this, we need to track the current location after each meeting.\n\n    # This requires more complex modeling, which is beyond the scope of this example.\n\n    # Instead, we'll proceed by assuming that the user can meet friends in any order, but must account for travel times.\n\n    # We'll create a variable for the order of meetings and enforce travel times.\n\n    # However, this is complex, so we'll use a simplified approach where we try to schedule as many meetings as possible without strict ordering.\n\n    # The solver will try to find a feasible subset of meetings that can be scheduled without overlapping, considering travel times.\n\n    # We'll define auxiliary variables to represent whether a meeting is scheduled and enforce constraints accordingly.\n\n    # For example, if both Joseph and Nancy are met, then the travel time from Russian Hill to Alamo Square must be accounted for if Joseph is met before Nancy.\n\n    # This is complex, so we'll proceed with a simplified model where the solver picks a subset of meetings that can be scheduled without strict ordering.\n\n    # Now, we'll define constraints that ensure that if two meetings are scheduled, their times do not overlap considering travel.\n\n    # For example, if Joseph and Nancy are both met, then:\n    # joseph_end + travel_time <= nancy_start OR nancy_end + travel_time <= joseph_start.\n\n    # Similarly for other pairs.\n\n    # Define travel times between locations\n    # Joseph is at Russian Hill, Nancy at Alamo Square, Jason at North Beach, Jeffrey at Financial District.\n\n    # Travel times between meeting locations:\n    #

Financial District to Alamo Square: 17\n    # Financial District to North Beach: 7\n\n    # Now, we'll add constraints for each pair of meetings to ensure that if both are scheduled, they don't overlap considering travel time.\n\n    #

Constraints ensure meetings fit within availability windows and last the required durations.\n2. **Travel Times**: The model accounts for travel times between locations to ensure feasible scheduling.\n3. **Objective**: The solver maximizes the number of meetings by evaluating all possible combinations and ensuring no overlaps considering travel times.\n4. **Output**: The solution prints the optimal schedule, indicating which friends can be met, their meeting times, and the total number of meetings.\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the constraints to find the best possible schedule for meeting friends in San Francisco."
