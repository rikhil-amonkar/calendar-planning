    # Define the order of meetings and travel times
    # We need to model the sequence of meetings and ensure travel times are accounted for
    # This is complex, so we'll use a simplified approach where we assume meetings are scheduled in some order with travel times in between.

    # We'll create a list of all possible meeting sequences and check feasibility for each.
    # However, this is computationally expensive, so instead, we'll use auxiliary variables to represent the order.

    # Alternatively, we can model the problem by assuming that some meetings may not happen due to time conflicts.
    # The goal is to maximize the number of meetings.

    # To simplify, we'll assume that the user can meet friends in any order, but must account for travel times between consecutive meetings.

    # We'll create variables to represent the order and enforce travel times between consecutive meetings.

    # This is complex, so instead, we'll use a heuristic approach where we try to schedule meetings in a way that maximizes the number of meetings.

    # For Z3, we can model the problem by allowing the solver to choose which meetings to attend, and enforce that the schedule is feasible.

    # We'll create a variable for the start time of the day (arrival_time is 540).
    # Then, for each possible meeting, we'll add constraints that the meeting starts after the arrival time plus travel time if it's the first meeting, or after the previous meeting's end plus travel time.

    # To model this, we need to track the current location after each meeting.

    # This requires more complex modeling, which is beyond the scope of this example.

    # Instead, we'll proceed by assuming that the user can meet friends in any order, but must account for travel times.

    # We'll create a variable for the order of meetings and enforce travel times.

    # However, this is complex, so we'll use a simplified approach where we try to schedule as many meetings as possible without strict ordering.

    # The solver will try to find a feasible subset of meetings that can be scheduled without overlapping, considering travel times.

    # We'll define auxiliary variables to represent whether a meeting is scheduled and enforce constraints accordingly.

    # For example, if both Joseph and Nancy are met, then the travel time from Russian Hill to Alamo Square must be accounted for if Joseph is met before Nancy.

    # This is complex, so we'll proceed with a simplified model where the solver picks a subset of meetings that can be scheduled without strict ordering.

    # Now, we'll define constraints that ensure that if two meetings are scheduled, their times do not overlap considering travel.

    # For example, if Joseph and Nancy are both met, then:
    # joseph_end + travel_time <= nancy_start OR nancy_end + travel_time <= joseph_start.

    # Similarly for other pairs.

    # Define travel times between locations
    # Joseph is at Russian Hill, Nancy at Alamo Square, Jason at North Beach, Jeffrey at Financial District.

    # Travel times between meeting locations:
    # Russian Hill to Alamo Square: 15
    # Russian Hill to North Beach: 5
    # Russian Hill to Financial District: 11
    # Alamo Square to Russian Hill: 13
    # Alamo Square to North Beach: 15
    # Alamo Square to Financial District: 17
    # North Beach to Russian Hill: 4
    # North Beach to Alamo Square: 16
    # North Beach to Financial District: 8
    # Financial District to Russian Hill: 10
    # Financial District to Alamo Square: 17
    # Financial District to North Beach: 7

    # Now, we'll add constraints for each pair of meetings to ensure that if both are scheduled, they don't overlap considering travel time.
