        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find an optimal schedule that allows us to meet all friends while respecting the travel times and meeting duration constraints. The approach involves defining variables for the start and end times of each meeting, ensuring they fit within the friends' availability windows, and accounting for travel times between locations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: For each friend (Betty, David, Barbara), define variables for the start and end times of their meetings. These times will be in minutes since 9:00 AM (the arrival time at Embarcadero).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Durations**: Ensure each meeting lasts at least the required minimum duration.\n   - **Availability Windows**: Ensure each meeting starts and ends within the friend's availability window.\n   - **Travel Times**: Account for travel times between locations when scheduling consecutive meetings.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (in this case, it's possible to meet all three, so the objective is to ensure all constraints are satisfied).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    # Betty's availability: 10:15 AM to 9:30 PM -> 75 to 750 minutes\n    betty_start_min = 75\n    betty_end_min = 750\n    \n    # David's availability: 1:00 PM to 8:15 PM -> 240 to 555 minutes\n    david_start_min = 240\n    david_end_min = 555\n    \n    # Barbara's availability: 9:15 AM to 8:15 PM -> 15 to 555 minutes\n    barbara_start_min = 15\n    barbara_end_min = 555\n    \n    # Meeting durations in minutes\n    betty_duration = 45\n    david_duration = 90\n    barbara_duration = 120\n    \n    # Travel times from each location to others (in minutes)\n    # From Embarcadero (starting point)\n    travel_emb_presidio = 20\n    travel_emb_richmond = 21\n    travel_emb_wharf = 6\n    \n    # From Presidio\n    travel_presidio_emb = 20\n    travel_presidio_richmond = 7\n    travel_presidio_wharf = 19\n    \n    # From Richmond\n    travel_richmond_emb = 19\n    travel_richmond_presidio = 7\n    travel_richmond_wharf = 18\n    \n    # From Fisherman's Wharf\n    travel_wharf_emb = 8\n    travel_wharf_presidio = 17\n    travel_wharf_richmond = 18\n    \n    # Variables for meeting start and end times\n    # Betty (Presidio)\n    betty_start = Int('betty_start')\n    betty_end = Int('betty_end')\n    \n    # David (Richmond)\n    david_start = Int('david_start')\n    david_end = Int('david_end')\n    \n    # Barbara (Fisherman's Wharf)\n    barbara_start = Int('barbara_start')\n    barbara_end = Int('barbara_end')\n    \n    # Constraints for meeting durations\n    s.add(betty_end == betty_start + betty_duration)\n    s.add(david_end == david_start + david_duration)\n    s.add(barbara_end == barbara_start + barbara_duration)\n    \n    # Constraints for availability windows\n    s.add(betty_start >= betty_start_min)\n    s.add(betty_end <= betty_end_min)\n    \n    s.add(david_start >= david_start_min)\n    s.add(david_end <= david_end_min)\n    \n    s.add(barbara_start >= barbara_start_min)\n    s.add(barbara_end <= barbara_end_min)\n    \n    # Variables to track the order of meetings and travel times\n    # We need to model the sequence of meetings and ensure travel times are respected.\n    # There are 3! = 6 possible orders.
