        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal times to visit each friend while respecting the travel times and meeting duration constraints. We'll use the Z3 solver to model the constraints and find a feasible schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, and the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Durations**: Ensure each meeting lasts at least the minimum required time.\n   - **Time Windows**: Meetings must occur within the friends' available time slots.\n   - **Travel Times**: Account for the time taken to travel between locations.\n   - **Sequencing**: Ensure that the start time of a meeting is after the end time of the previous meeting plus the travel time.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (in this case, we aim to meet all three friends if possible).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables for each meeting's start and end times\n    # Meeting with Timothy at Alamo Square\n    timothy_start = Int('timothy_start')\n    timothy_end = Int('timothy_end')\n    \n    # Meeting with Mark at Presidio\n    mark_start = Int('mark_start')\n    mark_end = Int('mark_end')\n    \n    # Meeting with Joseph at Russian Hill\n    joseph_start = Int('joseph_start')\n    joseph_end = Int('joseph_end')\n    \n    # Current time starts at 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM in minutes\n    \n    # Constraints for Timothy\n    # Timothy is available from 12:00 PM (720) to 4:15 PM (975)\n    s.add(timothy_start >= 720)\n    s.add(timothy_end <= 975)\n    s.add(timothy_end -

**Timothy's Meeting**: Must start after 12:00 PM and end by 4:15 PM, lasting at least 105 minutes. The start time must also account for the 10-minute travel from Golden Gate Park.\n   - **Mark's Meeting**: Must start after 6:45 PM and end by 9:00 PM, lasting at least 60 minutes.\n   - **Joseph's Meeting**: Must start after 4:45 PM and end by 9:30 PM, lasting at least 60 minutes.\n4. **Ordering**: The code checks two possible meeting orders:\n   - **Timothy \u2192 Joseph \u2192 Mark**: Travel times between locations are added as constraints. If feasible, the schedule is printed.\n   - **Timothy \u2192 Mark \u2192 Joseph**: Alternative order with corresponding travel times.\n5. **Output**: The feasible schedule is printed, showing the start and end times for each meeting in HH:MM format.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected, and the optimal schedule is found using the Z3 solver."
