It uses Z3 to maximize the number of friends met by ensuring that meetings are scheduled within their available times and accounting for travel times between locations. The solution will print the optimal schedule, including travel times and meeting times for each friend.\n\nNote: The actual output will vary depending on the solver's optimization. The program may need adjustments to handle all possible meeting orders or additional constraints for more complex scenarios."
