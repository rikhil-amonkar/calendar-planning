Jessica will be at Golden Gate Park from 1:45PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 30 minutes. Ashley will be at Bayview from 5:15PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 105 minutes. Ronald will be at Chinatown from 7:15AM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 90 minutes. William will be at North Beach from 1:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 15 minutes. Daniel will be at Mission District from 7:00AM to 11:15AM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
