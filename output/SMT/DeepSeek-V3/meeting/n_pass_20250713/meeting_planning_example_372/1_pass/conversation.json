This is a heuristic; a more complete solution would explore all possible orders.\n6. **Solver Check**: The solver checks if the constraints are satisfiable and prints the schedule if found.\n\nThis program finds a valid schedule that meets all constraints. For a more optimal solution (e.g., minimizing total travel time), you could add an objective function to the solver."
