You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

We add constraints to ensure meetings occur within the friend's availability and account for travel times between locations.\n4. **Optimization**: The solver maximizes the number of friends met by scheduling as many meetings as possible without violating constraints.\n5. **Output**: The solution is formatted as a JSON dictionary with the itinerary sorted by meeting start times.\n\nThis approach ensures that we meet the maximum number of friends while respecting all constraints."
