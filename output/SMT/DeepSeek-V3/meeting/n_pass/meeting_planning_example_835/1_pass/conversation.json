You'd like to meet Steven for a minimum of 105 minutes. Deborah will be at Bayview from 8:30AM to 12:00PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 30 minutes. Matthew will be at Marina District from 9:15AM to 2:15PM. You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 45 minutes. Joseph will be at Union Square from 2:15PM to 6:45PM.

You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 30 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Mission District from 6:30PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
