Rebecca will be at Bayview from 9:00AM to 12:45PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 90 minutes. Amanda will be at Pacific Heights from 6:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Amanda for a minimum of 90 minutes. James will be at Alamo Square from 9:45AM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet James for a minimum of 90 minutes. Sarah will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 90 minutes. Melissa will be at Golden Gate Park from 9:00AM to 6:45PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find an optimal itinerary that allows us to meet as many friends as possible within the given constraints. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints on meeting times, travel times, and ensuring that the meetings do not overlap and respect the friends' availability.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: For each friend, define start and end times of the meeting in minutes from 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Duration**: Each meeting must last at least 90 minutes.\n   - **Friend Availability**: The meeting must occur within the friend's available time window.\n   - **Travel Time**: The time taken to travel between locations must be accounted for between consecutive meetings.\n   - **Non-overlapping Meetings**: Ensure that meetings do not overlap and that travel time is considered between them.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met. Since meeting all friends might not be feasible, we'll prioritize meeting as many as possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport json\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize Z3 solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Friends and their availability\n    friends = {\n        \"Rebecca\": {\"location\": \"Bayview\", \"start\": 9*60, \"end\": 12*60 + 45, \"duration\": 90},\n        \"Amanda\": {\"location\": \"Pacific Heights\", \"start\": 18*60 + 30, \"end\": 21*60 + 45, \"duration\": 90},\n        \"James\": {\"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"start\": 9*60 + 45, \"end\": 21*60 + 15, \"duration\": 90},\n        \"Sarah\": {\"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"start\": 8*60, \"end\": 21*60 + 30, \"duration\": 90},\n        \"Melissa\": {\"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"start\": 9*60, \"end\": 18*60 + 45, \"duration\": 90}\n    }\n\n    # Travel times dictionary (from -> to -> minutes)\n    travel_times = {\n        \"The Castro\": {\n            \"Bayview\": 19,\n            \"Pacific Heights\": 16,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 8,\n            \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 24,\n            \"Golden Gate Park\": 11\n        },\n        \"Bayview\": {\n            \"The Castro\": 20,\n            \"Pacific Heights\": 23,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 16,\n            \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 25,\n            \"Golden Gate Park\": 22\n        },\n        \"Pacific Heights\": {\n            \"The Castro\": 16,\n            \"Bayview\": 22,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 10,\n            \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 13,\n            \"Golden Gate Park\": 15\n        },\n        \"Alamo Square\": {\n            \"The Castro\": 8,\n            \"Bayview\": 16,\n            \"Pacific Heights\": 10,\n            \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 19,\n            \"Golden Gate Park\": 9\n        },\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\": {\n            \"The Castro\": 26,\n            \"Bayview\": 26,\n            \"Pacific Heights\": 12,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 20,\n            \"Golden Gate Park\": 25\n        },\n        \"Golden Gate Park\": {\n            \"The Castro\": 13,\n            \"Bayview\": 23,\n            \"Pacific Heights\": 16,\n            \"Alamo Square\": 10,\n            \"Fisherman's Wharf\": 24\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Decision variables: whether to meet each friend\n    meet_vars = {name: Bool(f\"meet_{name}\") for name in friends}\n\n    # Meeting start and end times (in minutes since midnight)\n    start_times = {name: Int(f\"start_{name}\") for name in friends}\n    end_times = {name: Int(f\"end_{name}\") for name in friends}\n\n    # Current location starts at The Castro at 9:00 AM (540 minutes)\n    current_location = \"The Castro\"\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM in minutes\n\n    # Constraints for each friend\n    order = []\n    for name in friends:\n        info = friends[name]\n        s.add(Implies(meet_vars[name], start_times[name] >= info[\"start\"]))\n        s.add(Implies(meet_vars[name], end_times[name] <= info[\"end\"]))\n        s.add(Implies(meet_vars[name], end_times[name] == start_times[name] + info[\"duration\"]))\n        # Ensure meeting is within their window\n        s.add(Implies(meet_vars[name], start_times[name] >= info[\"start\"]))\n        s.add(Implies(meet_vars[name], end_times[name] <= info[\"end\"]))\n\n    # Define the order of meetings (this is a heuristic; we may need to explore permutations)\n    # For simplicity, let's try to meet Rebecca first (since her window is earliest)\n    # Then Melissa, James, Sarah, Amanda\n    # We'll need to model the sequence properly with travel times\n\n    # This is a simplified approach; a more comprehensive solution would explore all permutations\n    # But for the sake of this problem, let's assume a fixed order and adjust times accordingly\n\n    # We'll need to create a sequence of meetings with travel times\n    # This is complex; alternatively, we can use a more flexible approach with no fixed order\n\n    # Alternative approach: model the sequence with variables indicating the order\n    # But this is complex for Z3.
