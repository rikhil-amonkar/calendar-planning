        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal schedule that allows us to meet all three friends (Anthony, Rebecca, and Melissa) for the desired minimum durations while respecting the travel times between locations. We'll use the Z3 solver to model the constraints and find a feasible schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting and the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The start time of the day is 9:00 AM at the Sunset District.\n   - Melissa is available from 8:15 AM to 1:30 PM at North Beach. We need to meet her for at least 105 minutes.\n   - Anthony is available from 1:15 PM to 2:30 PM at Chinatown. We need to meet him for at least 60 minutes.\n   - Rebecca is available from 7:30 PM to 9:15 PM at Russian Hill. We need to meet her for at least 105 minutes.\n   - Ensure that travel times between locations are accounted for when moving from one meeting to another.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the total time spent with friends, ensuring all constraints are met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    # 9:00 AM is 540 minutes (9 * 60)\n    # Define variables for start and end times of each meeting and travels\n    \n    # Meeting Melissa in North Beach\n    melissa_start = Int('melissa_start')\n    melissa_end = Int('melissa_end')\n    melissa_min_duration = 105\n    \n    # Meeting Anthony in Chinatown\n    anthony_start = Int('anthony_start')\n    anthony_end = Int('anthony_end')\n    anthony_min_duration = 60\n    \n    # Meeting Rebecca in Russian Hill\n    rebecca_start = Int('rebecca_start')\n    rebecca_end = Int('rebecca_end')\n    rebecca_min_duration = 105\n    \n    # Time bounds for each friend's availability\n    # Melissa: 8:15 AM (495) to 1:30 PM (810)\n    melissa_available_start = 495\n    melissa_available_end = 810\n    \n    # Anthony: 1:15 PM (795) to 2:30 PM (870)\n    anthony_available_start = 795\n    anthony_available_end = 870\n    \n    # Rebecca: 7:30 PM (1170) to 9:15 PM (1275)\n    rebecca_available_start = 1170\n    rebecca_available_end = 1275\n    \n    # Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM (540)\n    current_time = 540\n    \n    # Travel times (in minutes)\n    # From Sunset to North Beach: 29\n    sunset_to_north_beach = 29\n    \n    # From North Beach to Chinatown: 6\n    north_beach_to_chinatown = 6\n    \n    # From Chinatown to Russian Hill: 7\n    chinatown_to_russian_hill = 7\n    \n    # Constraints for Melissa\n    s.add(melissa_start >= melissa_available_start)\n    s.add(melissa_end <= melissa_available_end)\n    s.add(melissa_end - melissa_start >= melissa_min_duration)\n    \n    # The trip to meet Melissa starts at current_time (540) and takes 29 minutes\n    s.add(melissa_start >= current_time + sunset_to_north_beach)\n    \n    # Constraints for Anthony\n    s.add(anthony_start >= anthony_available_start)\n    s.add(anthony_end <= anthony_available_end)\n    s.add(anthony_end - anthony_start >= anthony_min_duration)\n    \n    # Travel from North Beach to Chinatown after meeting Melissa\n    s.add(anthony_start >= melissa_end + north_beach_to_chinatown)\n    \n    # Constraints for Rebecca\n    s.add(rebecca_start >= rebecca_available_start)\n    s.add(rebecca_end <= rebecca_available_end)\n    s.add(rebecca_end - rebecca_start >= rebecca_min_duration)\n    \n    # Travel from Chinatown to Russian Hill after meeting Anthony\n    s.add(rebecca_start >= anthony_end + chinatown_to_russian_hill)\n    \n    # Check if the constraints are satisfiable\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        # Extract the values\n        melissa_s = m.eval(melissa_start).as_long()\n        melissa_e = m.eval(melissa_end).as_long()\n        anthony_s = m.eval(anthony_start).as_long()\n        anthony_e = m.eval(anthony_end).as_long()\n        rebecca_s = m.eval(rebecca_start).as_long()\n        rebecca_e = m.eval(rebecca_end).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to time strings\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            hours = minutes // 60\n            mins = minutes % 60\n            ampm = \"AM\" if hours < 12 else \"PM\"\n            if hours > 12:\n                hours -= 12\n            return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d} {ampm}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Meet Melissa in North Beach from {minutes_to_time(melissa_s)} to {minutes_to_time(melissa_e)}\")\n        print(f\"Meet Anthony in Chinatown from {minutes_to_time(anthony_s)} to {minutes_to_time(anthony_e)}\")\n        print(f\"Meet Rebecca in Russian Hill from {minutes_to_time(rebecca_s)} to {minutes_to_time(rebecca_e)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No feasible schedule found.\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The code defines variables for the start and end times of each meeting (Melissa, Anthony, Rebecca) and sets constraints based on their availability and minimum required meeting durations.\n2. **Travel Times**: The code accounts for travel times between locations (e.g., from Sunset District to North Beach takes 29 minutes) and ensures that the start time of the next meeting is after the end time of the previous meeting plus travel time.\n3. **Time Conversion**: The `minutes_to_time` function converts minutes since midnight back to a readable time format (e.g., 540 minutes becomes 9:00 AM).\n4. **Solver Check**: The Z3 solver checks if the constraints are satisfiable. If a solution exists, it prints the optimal meeting times; otherwise, it indicates no feasible schedule was found.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are met, and the schedule is optimized to maximize time spent with friends while respecting travel times and availability."
