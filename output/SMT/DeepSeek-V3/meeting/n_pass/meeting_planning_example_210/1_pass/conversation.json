We'll use the Z3 solver to model the constraints and find a feasible schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, as well as the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Ensure each meeting starts and ends within the friend's availability window.\n   - Ensure the meeting durations meet the minimum required times.\n   - Ensure there is enough time to travel between locations when switching meetings.\n   - Ensure no overlapping meetings unless travel time is accounted for.\n3. **Objective**: The goal is to meet all friends for the minimum required durations, so we don't need an optimization objective; we just need to find a feasible solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables for meeting start and end times\n    # Melissa at Financial District\n    melissa_start = Int('melissa_start')\n    melissa_end = Int('melissa_end')\n    # Emily at Presidio\n    emily_start = Int('emily_start')\n    emily_end = Int('emily_end')\n    # Joseph at Richmond District\n    joseph_start = Int('joseph_start')\n    joseph_end = Int('joseph_end')\n\n    # Define travel time variables (in minutes since 9:00 AM)\n    travel_to_melissa = 11  # Fisherman's Wharf to Financial District\n    travel_to_emily = 17    # Fisherman's Wharf to Presidio\n    travel_to_joseph = 18   # Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District\n    travel_melissa_to_emily = 23  # Financial District to Presidio\n    travel_melissa_to_joseph = 22 # Financial District to Richmond District\n    travel_emily_to_melissa = 23  # Presidio to Financial District\n    travel_emily_to_joseph = 7    # Presidio to Richmond District\n    travel_joseph_to_melissa = 22 # Richmond District to Financial District\n    travel_joseph_to_emily = 7    # Richmond District to Presidio\n\n    # Convert friend availability times to minutes since 9:00 AM\n    emily_available_start = (16 * 60 + 15) - (9 * 60)  # 4:15 PM is 16:15, 9:00 AM is 9:00\n    emily_available_end = (21 * 60) - (9 * 60)         # 9:00 PM is 21:00\n    joseph_available_start = (17 * 60 + 15) - (9 * 60)  # 5:15 PM is 17:15\n    joseph_available_end = (22 * 60) - (9 * 60)         # 10:00 PM is 22:00\n    melissa_available_start = (15 * 60 + 45) - (9 * 60) # 3:45 PM is 15:45\n    melissa_available_end = (21 * 60 + 45) - (9 * 60)   # 9:45 PM is 21:45\n\n    # Meeting duration constraints\n    s.add(melissa_end - melissa_start >= 75)\n    s.add(emily_end - emily_start >= 105)\n    s.add(joseph_end - joseph_start >= 120)\n\n    # Meeting must be within friend's availability\n    s.add(melissa_start >= melissa_available_start)\n    s.add(melissa_end <= melissa_available_end)\n    s.add(emily_start >= emily_available_start)\n    s.add(emily_end <= emily_available_end)\n    s.add(joseph_start >= joseph_available_start)\n    s.add(joseph_end <= joseph_available_end)\n\n    # The initial location is Fisherman's Wharf at time 0 (9:00 AM)\n    # We need to decide the order of meetings.
