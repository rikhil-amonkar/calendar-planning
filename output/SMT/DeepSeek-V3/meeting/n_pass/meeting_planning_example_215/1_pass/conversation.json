These are converted into minutes from the start time (9:00 AM).\n3. **Z3 Variables**: Variables are created for the start and end times of each meeting, as well as the location before each meeting.\n4. **Constraints**: The solver ensures that:\n   - Meetings occur within the friends' available windows.\n   - Meetings last at least the minimum required duration.\n   - Travel times between locations are accounted for.\n5. **Order of Meetings**: The program assumes an order (Jason -> Jessica -> Sandra) to simplify the problem. A more general solution would consider all permutations, but this approach works for the given constraints.\n6. **Output**: If a feasible schedule is found, the program prints the meeting times in minutes from 9:00 AM.\n\nThis solution ensures that all friends are met within their available times, accounting for travel times and meeting durations."
