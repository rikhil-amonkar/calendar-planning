Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nBayview to Embarcadero: 19.\nBayview to Richmond District: 25.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\nEmbarcadero to Bayview: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Richmond District: 21.\nEmbarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf: 6.\nRichmond District to Bayview: 26.\nRichmond District to Embarcadero: 19.\nRichmond District to Fisherman's Wharf: 18.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nFisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero: 8.\nFisherman's Wharf to Richmond District: 18.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Jessica will be at Embarcadero from 4:45PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 30 minutes. Sandra will be at Richmond District from 6:30PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 120 minutes. Jason will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:00PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find an optimal itinerary that meets all constraints while maximizing the number of friends met. The key is to ensure that travel times between locations are accounted for and that meetings fit within the available time slots.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the start and end times of each meeting, as well as travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - Meetings must fit within the friends' available time windows.\n   - Travel times between locations must be respected.\n   - The total time must allow for all meetings and travel.\n3. **Optimization**: We'll aim to meet all friends if possible, prioritizing longer meetings (like Sandra's 120-minute meeting) and ensuring shorter meetings (like Jason and Jessica) fit around them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport datetime\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    #
