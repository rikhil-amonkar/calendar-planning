Ensure that meetings with friends do not overlap and account for travel times between locations.\n   - Ensure that each meeting lasts at least the minimum required duration.\n   - Ensure that meetings occur within the friends' available time windows.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (in this case, we can meet all three if possible).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables for each meeting's start and end times\n    # Meeting with Jason at Fisherman's Wharf\n    jason_start = Real('jason_start')\n    jason_end = Real('jason_end')\n    \n    # Meeting with Jessica at Embarcadero\n    jessica_start = Real('jessica_start')\n    jessica_end = Real('jessica_end')\n    \n    # Meeting with Sandra at Richmond District\n    sandra_start = Real('sandra_start')\n    sandra_end = Real('sandra_end')\n\n    # Define travel times (in minutes) from the problem statement\n    bayview_to_embarcadero = 19\n    bayview_to_richmond = 25\n    bayview_to_fisherman = 25\n    embarcadero_to_bayview = 21\n    embarcadero_to_richmond = 21\n    embarcadero_to_fisherman = 6\n    richmond_to_bayview = 26\n    richmond_to_embarcadero = 19\n    richmond_to_fisherman = 18\n    fisherman_to_bayview = 26\n    fisherman_to_embarcadero = 8\n    fisherman_to_richmond = 18\n\n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes)\n    start_time = 540  # 9:00 AM in minutes\n\n    # Jason's availability: 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM (960 to 1005 minutes)\n    jason_available_start = 960\n    jason_available_end = 1005\n    # Jessica's availability: 4:45 PM to 7:00 PM (1005 to 1140 minutes)\n    jessica_available_start = 1005\n    jessica_available_end = 1140\n    # Sandra's availability: 6:30 PM to 9:45 PM (1170 to 1305 minutes)\n    sandra_available_start = 1170\n    sandra_available_end = 1305\n\n    # Constraints for Jason's meeting\n    s.add(jason_start >= jason_available_start)\n    s.add(jason_end <= jason_available_end)\n    s.add(jason_end -

Each meeting must start and end within the friend's available time window.\n   - Each meeting must last at least the minimum required duration (30 minutes for Jason and Jessica, 120 minutes for Sandra).\n   - Travel times between locations are accounted for between consecutive meetings.\n3. **Order of Meetings**: The code assumes an order of meetings (Jason -> Jessica -> Sandra) and adds constraints to ensure sufficient travel time between locations.\n4. **Solution Check**: The solver checks if the constraints are satisfiable. If a solution exists, it prints the start and end times for each meeting in both minutes and a readable AM/PM format.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are met and provides a feasible schedule to meet all three friends."
