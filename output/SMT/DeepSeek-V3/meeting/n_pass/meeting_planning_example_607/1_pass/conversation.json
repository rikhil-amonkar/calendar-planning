You'd like to meet Linda for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

Constraints ensure meetings fit within availability windows and meet duration requirements.\n3. **Travel Time Handling**: The order of meetings is heuristically determined (prioritizing friends with earlier end times). Travel times between consecutive meetings are accounted for by adding constraints that ensure sufficient time between meetings.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If the solver finds a feasible schedule, the start and end times are extracted from the model and formatted into the required JSON output. If no solution is found, an empty itinerary is returned.\n\nThis approach leverages the Z3 solver to handle the complex constraints and find a feasible meeting schedule that maximizes the number of friends met while respecting all given constraints."
