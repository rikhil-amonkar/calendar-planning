travel times, and maximizes the total time spent with friends. The solution will print the optimal schedule if one exists.\n\nNote: The travel times are converted from minutes to hours for consistency with the time representation. The actual travel times dictionary should be carefully checked for completeness and correctness. The program assumes that the travel times are symmetric (i.e., A to B is the same as B to A), but the provided data may not always reflect this, so adjustments may be needed."
