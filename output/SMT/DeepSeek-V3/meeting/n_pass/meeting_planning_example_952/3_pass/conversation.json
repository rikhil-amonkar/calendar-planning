If so, it prints the arrival and departure times for each location.\n\nThis is a basic framework. A more complete solution would include:\n- Modeling the sequence of visits to ensure travel times are respected.\n- Adding optimization to maximize the number of friends met.\n- Handling cases where not all friends can be met due to time constraints. \n\nYou can expand this code to include these features as needed."

Let me know if you need any clarification or have questions about the implementation."
