Joseph will be at Russian Hill from 8:30AM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 60 minutes. Nancy will be at Alamo Square from 11:00AM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jason will be at North Beach from 4:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 15 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Financial District from 10:30AM to 3:45PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
