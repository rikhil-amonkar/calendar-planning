    # Define the order of meetings and travel times
    # We need to model the sequence of meetings and ensure travel times are respected

    # We'll use a list to represent the possible orderings of meetings
    # For simplicity, we'll assume that the user starts at Bayview (arrival_time = 540)

    # Since there are 4 friends, there are 4! = 24 possible orderings. 
    # However, enumerating all is impractical; instead, we'll use auxiliary variables to represent the order.

    # Instead, we'll model the sequence by ensuring that for any two meetings, one is before or after the other with travel time.

    # For example, if meeting A is before meeting B, then A's end time + travel from A's location to B's location <= B's start time.

    # We'll need variables to track the location after each meeting.
    # But this complicates the model. Instead, we'll assume that the user can choose any order but must respect travel times.

    # Let's model the travel times between locations.
    # The locations are: Bayview (start), Russian Hill, Alamo Square, North Beach, Financial District.

    # Travel times from Bayview:
    # Bayview to Russian Hill: 23
    # Bayview to Alamo Square: 16
    # Bayview to North Beach: 21
    # Bayview to Financial District: 19

    # Travel times between other locations are as given in the problem.

    # We'll need to model the sequence of meetings and the travel times between them.

    # To simplify, we'll assume that the user can meet friends in any order, but the schedule must be feasible.

    # We'll add constraints for the first meeting: it must start after arrival_time + travel time from Bayview to the first meeting's location.

    # For each subsequent meeting, its start time must be after the previous meeting's end time plus travel time from the previous meeting's location to the current meeting's location.

    # To model this, we'll need to track the location after each meeting.

    # But this is complex in Z3. Instead, we'll use a more straightforward approach: assume that the user can meet friends in any order, but the schedule must respect travel times.

    # We'll create variables to represent the order of meetings.

    # Let's create variables to indicate the order of meetings.

    # For each pair of meetings, we'll have a variable indicating which comes first.
