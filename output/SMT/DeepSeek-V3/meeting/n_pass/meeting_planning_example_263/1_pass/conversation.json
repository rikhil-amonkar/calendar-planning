        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal times to meet each friend while respecting the travel times between locations and the constraints on meeting durations and availability. We'll use the Z3 solver to model this as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, and the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Ensure meetings do not overlap and account for travel times between locations.\n   - Ensure each meeting lasts at least the minimum required duration.\n   - Ensure meetings occur within the friends' availability windows.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (in this case, all three can be met, so the objective is to find a feasible schedule).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables for meeting start and end times\n    # Meeting with Karen at Fisherman's Wharf\n    karen_start = Int('karen_start')\n    karen_end = Int('karen_end')\n    \n    # Meeting with Anthony at Financial District\n    anthony_start = Int('anthony_start')\n    anthony_end = Int('anthony_end')\n    \n    # Meeting with Betty at Embarcadero\n    betty_start = Int('betty_start')\n    betty_end = Int('betty_end')\n    \n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    arrival_time = 540  # 9:00 AM is 540 minutes since midnight\n    \n    # Friends' availability windows in minutes since midnight\n    # Betty: 7:45 PM to 9:45 PM (1170 to 1305)\n    betty_available_start = 1170\n    betty_available_end = 1305\n    \n    # Karen: 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM (525 to 900)\n    karen_available_start = 525\n    karen_available_end = 900\n    \n    # Anthony: 9:15 AM to 9:30 PM (555 to 1350)\n    anthony_available_start = 555\n    anthony_available_end = 1350\n    \n    # Minimum meeting durations in minutes\n    karen_min_duration = 30\n    anthony_min_duration = 105\n    betty_min_duration = 15\n    \n    # Travel times in minutes\n    # From Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25\n    bayview_to_fisherman = 25\n    # From Fisherman's Wharf to Financial District: 11\n    fisherman_to_financial = 11\n    # From Financial District to Embarcadero: 4\n    financial_to_embarcadero = 4\n    # From Embarcadero to Bayview: 21 (not needed for return)\n    \n    # Constraints for Karen (Fisherman's Wharf)\n    s.add(karen_start >= karen_available_start)\n    s.add(karen_end <= karen_available_end)\n    s.add(karen_end - karen_start >= karen_min_duration)\n    # You start at Bayview at 540 (9:00 AM), travel to Fisherman's Wharf takes 25 minutes\n    s.add(karen_start >= arrival_time + bayview_to_fisherman)\n    \n    # Constraints for Anthony (Financial District)\n    s.add(anthony_start >= anthony_available_start)\n    s.add(anthony_end <= anthony_available_end)\n    s.add(anthony_end - anthony_start >= anthony_min_duration)\n    # After meeting Karen, travel to Financial District takes 11 minutes\n    s.add(anthony_start >= karen_end + fisherman_to_financial)\n    \n    # Constraints for Betty (Embarcadero)\n    s.add(betty_start >= betty_available_start)\n    s.add(betty_end <= betty_available_end)\n    s.add(betty_end - betty_start >= betty_min_duration)\n    # After meeting Anthony, travel to Embarcadero takes 4 minutes\n    s.add(betty_start >= anthony_end + financial_to_embarcadero)\n    \n    # Check if the constraints are satisfiable\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        # Convert times back to human-readable format\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            h = minutes // 60\n            m = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{h}:{m:02d}\"\n        \n        karen_s = m.evaluate(karen_start).as_long()\n        karen_e = m.evaluate(karen_end).as_long()\n        anthony_s = m.evaluate(anthony_start).as_long()\n        anthony_e = m.evaluate(anthony_end).as_long()\n        betty_s = m.evaluate(betty_start).as_long()\n        betty_e = m.evaluate(betty_end).as_long()\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Meet Karen at Fisherman's Wharf from {minutes_to_time(karen_s)} to {minutes_to_time(karen_e)}\")\n        print(f\"Meet Anthony at Financial District from {minutes_to_time(anthony_s)} to {minutes_to_time(anthony_e)}\")\n        print(f\"Meet Betty at Embarcadero from {minutes_to_time(betty_s)} to {minutes_to_time(betty_e)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No feasible schedule found.\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables**: The start and end times for each meeting (Karen, Anthony, Betty) are defined as integer variables.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - **Meeting Durations**: Each meeting must last at least the minimum required duration (e.g., 30 minutes for Karen).\n   - **Availability Windows**: Meetings must occur within the friends' specified availability times.\n   - **Travel Times**: The start time of each subsequent meeting must account for the travel time from the previous location.\n3. **Solver Check**: The Z3 solver checks if all constraints can be satisfied. If yes, it prints the optimal meeting times; otherwise, it indicates no feasible schedule exists.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are met, and the schedule maximizes the number of friends met by efficiently accounting for travel times and availability windows."
