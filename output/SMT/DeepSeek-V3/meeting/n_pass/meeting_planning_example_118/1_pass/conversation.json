Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nBayview to Union Square: 17.\nBayview to Presidio: 31.\nUnion Square to Bayview: 15.\nUnion Square to Presidio: 24.\nPresidio to Bayview: 31.\nPresidio to Union Square: 22.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Richard will be at Union Square from 8:45AM to 1:00PM. You'd like to meet Richard for a minimum of 120 minutes. Charles will be at Presidio from 9:45AM to 1:00PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
