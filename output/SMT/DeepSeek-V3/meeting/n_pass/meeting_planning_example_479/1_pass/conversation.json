The heuristic assumes a specific order of meetings (Mary, Kevin, Stephanie, Deborah, Emily), which may not be optimal. A more comprehensive solution would explore all possible orders or use a more sophisticated scheduling algorithm. \n\nThe output will show the start and end times for each meeting if a solution is found. The times are in hours (e.g., 9.00 is 9:00 AM). \n\nNote: The actual optimal order might require trying different permutations or using a more advanced scheduling approach, but this provides a basic framework to start with."
