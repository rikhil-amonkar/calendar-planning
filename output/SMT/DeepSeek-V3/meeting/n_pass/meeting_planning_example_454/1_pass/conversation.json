Jessica will be at Golden Gate Park from 1:45PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Jessica for a minimum of 30 minutes. Ashley will be at Bayview from 5:15PM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Ashley for a minimum of 105 minutes. Ronald will be at Chinatown from 7:15AM to 2:45PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 90 minutes. William will be at North Beach from 1:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 15 minutes. Daniel will be at Mission District from 7:00AM to 11:15AM. You'd like to meet Daniel for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The heuristic assumes a specific order of meetings (Daniel, Ronald, Jessica, William, Ashley), which may not be optimal but should yield a valid solution. The output is a JSON-formatted dictionary with the itinerary.\n\nNote: The heuristic order may not always find the optimal solution. For a more robust solution, you'd need to explore all possible permutations of meeting orders, which is computationally expensive but feasible for small numbers of friends. The current approach is a practical simplification."
