The first arrival is at Richmond at 9:00 AM (time 0).\n   - If a friend is met, their arrival and departure times must be within their availability window, and the meeting duration must be satisfied.\n   - Travel times between consecutive meetings are accounted for.\n6. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n7. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the schedule is printed with the times converted back to a readable format.\n\nThis program will output the optimal schedule that meets as many friends as possible within the given constraints."
