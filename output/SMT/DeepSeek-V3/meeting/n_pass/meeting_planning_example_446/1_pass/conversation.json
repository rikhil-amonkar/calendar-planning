It uses Z3 to find a schedule that maximizes the number of friends met while respecting travel times and availability windows. The solution will print the optimal meeting schedule and the total number of friends met.\n\nNote: The code may need adjustments based on the exact interpretation of the constraints (e.g., whether meetings can overlap or if certain friends must be met in a specific order). The current implementation assumes that meetings must follow a sequence with travel times in between, and Kenneth must be met last due to his late availability."
