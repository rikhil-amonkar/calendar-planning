        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal times to meet Robert while adhering to the given constraints. We'll use the Z3 solver to find a feasible schedule that allows us to meet Robert for at least 120 minutes, considering the travel times between locations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: We need to define variables for the start and end times of the meeting with Robert. These times must be within Robert's availability window (11:15 AM to 5:45 PM).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting duration must be at least 120 minutes.\n   - The start time of the meeting must be after or equal to Robert's availability start time (11:15 AM).\n   - The end time of the meeting must be before or equal to Robert's availability end time (5:45 PM).\n   - The time taken to travel from Nob Hill to Presidio (17 minutes) must be accounted for. Since we arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM, we can leave Nob Hill at any time after 9:00 AM to reach Presidio by the meeting start time.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the meeting duration (or ensure it meets the minimum requirement).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    # Robert's availability: 11:15 AM to 5:45 PM\n    robert_start = (11 * 60 + 15) - (9 * 60)  # 135 minutes after 9:00 AM (11:15 AM is 2h15m after 9:00)\n    robert_end = (17 * 60 + 45) - (9 * 60)    # 525 minutes after 9:00 AM (5:45 PM is 8h45m after 9:00)\n    \n    # Variables for meeting start and end times (relative to 9:00 AM)\n    meeting_start = Int('meeting_start')\n    meeting_end = Int('meeting_end')\n    \n    # Travel time from Nob Hill to Presidio is 17 minutes\n    travel_time = 17\n    \n    # Constraints\n    # 1. Meeting duration is at least 120 minutes\n    s.add(meeting_end - meeting_start >= 120)\n    \n    # 2. Meeting must be within Robert's availability\n    s.add(meeting_start >= robert_start)\n    s.add(meeting_end <= robert_end)\n    \n    # 3. Time to travel to Presidio: leave Nob Hill at (meeting_start - travel_time) >= 0 (since we arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM (0 minutes))\n    s.add(meeting_start - travel_time >= 0)\n    \n    # Check if the constraints are satisfiable\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start = m[meeting_start].as_long()\n        end = m[meeting_end].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert times back to HH:MM format\n        def to_time_str(minutes):\n            total_minutes = 9 * 60 + minutes\n            h = total_minutes // 60\n            m = total_minutes % 60\n            return f\"{h}:{m:02d}\"\n        \n        start_time = to_time_str(start)\n        end_time = to_time_str(end)\n        \n        print(f\"SOLUTION: Meet Robert from {start_time} to {end_time}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No feasible schedule found.\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All times are converted to minutes relative to 9:00 AM (0 minutes) for easier arithmetic. For example, 11:15 AM is 135 minutes after 9:00 AM.\n2. **Variables**: `meeting_start` and `meeting_end` are Z3 integer variables representing the start and end times of the meeting with Robert.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting duration (`meeting_end - meeting_start`) must be at least 120 minutes.\n   - The meeting must start no earlier than Robert's availability start time (11:15 AM) and end no later than his availability end time (5:45 PM).\n   - The time to travel to Presidio (17 minutes) is accounted for by ensuring the departure from Nob Hill (`meeting_start - travel_time`) is after 9:00 AM.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If the constraints are satisfiable, the model provides values for `meeting_start` and `meeting_end`, which are then converted back to HH:MM format for readability.\n\nThis approach ensures that we meet Robert for the required duration while respecting all given constraints."
