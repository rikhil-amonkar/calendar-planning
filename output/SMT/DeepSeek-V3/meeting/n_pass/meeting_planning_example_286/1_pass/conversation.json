Rebecca will be at Mission District from 11:30AM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 120 minutes. Karen will be at Bayview from 12:45PM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Carol will be at Sunset District from 10:15AM to 11:45AM.

The solution maximizes the total time spent with friends. The output will show the meeting times for each friend and the total time spent with them.\n\nNote: The Z3 solver may find multiple valid schedules, but the `maximize(total_time)` ensures we pick the one where you spend the most time with friends. The code assumes you start with Carol first, but Z3 explores other orders if needed."
