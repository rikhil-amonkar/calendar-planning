Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nGolden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 10.\nGolden Gate Park to Presidio: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\nAlamo Square to Golden Gate Park: 9.\nAlamo Square to Presidio: 18.\nAlamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\nPresidio to Golden Gate Park: 12.\nPresidio to Alamo Square: 18.\nPresidio to Russian Hill: 14.\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\nRussian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\nRussian Hill to Presidio: 14.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00AM. Timothy will be at Alamo Square from 12:00PM to 4:15PM. You'd like to meet Timothy for a minimum of 105 minutes. Mark will be at Presidio from 6:45PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 60 minutes. Joseph will be at Russian Hill from 4:45PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find an optimal itinerary that meets all the constraints. The goal is to maximize the number of friends met while adhering to the time and duration constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the start and end times of each meeting with friends (Timothy, Mark, Joseph).\n2. **Add Constraints**: \n   - **Timothy**: Must be met between 12:00 PM and 4:15 PM for at least 105 minutes.\n   - **Mark**: Must be met between 6:45 PM and 9:00 PM for at least 60 minutes.\n   - **Joseph**: Must be met between 4:45 PM and 9:30 PM for at least 60 minutes.\n   -

Two possible meeting orders are tried:\n   - **Timothy \u2192 Joseph \u2192 Mark**: After meeting Timothy, travel to Joseph (13 minutes), then to Mark (14 minutes).\n   - **Timothy \u2192 Mark \u2192 Joseph**: After meeting Timothy, travel to Mark (18 minutes), then to Joseph (14 minutes).\n5. **Output**: The feasible schedule is converted back to HH:MM format and printed as a JSON object.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are met, and the optimal schedule is found using the Z3 solver."
