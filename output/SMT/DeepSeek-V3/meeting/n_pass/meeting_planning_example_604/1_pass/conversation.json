You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

For each friend, we create start and end time variables.\n   - Constraints ensure meetings occur within the friend's availability window and meet the minimum duration.\n   - Travel times between locations are accounted for by ensuring the next meeting starts after the previous one ends plus travel time.\n   - Overlapping meetings are prevented by ensuring no two meetings overlap in time.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the model is evaluated to get the start and end times for each meeting, which are then formatted into the desired output.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are satisfied and the itinerary is optimized to meet as many friends as possible within the given time windows."
