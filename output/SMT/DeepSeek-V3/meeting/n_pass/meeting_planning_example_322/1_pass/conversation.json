For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find an optimal itinerary that meets all the constraints while maximizing the number of friends met. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints on meeting times, travel times, and ensuring that all meetings fit within the available time slots.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: For each meeting, define start and end times as Z3 variables.\n2. **Add Constraints**: \n   - Ensure each meeting lasts at least the minimum required duration.\n   - Ensure travel time between locations is accounted for when moving from one meeting to another.\n   - Ensure meetings do not overlap and fit within the friends' availability windows.\n3. **Optimize**: The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, but given the constraints, we'll prioritize meeting all friends if possible. If not, we'll adjust the durations or skip some meetings.\n4. **Extract Solution**: Once the solver finds a feasible solution, extract the meeting times and format them into the required JSON structure.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport json\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables for each meeting's start and end times (in minutes since 9:00 AM)\n    # Convert all times to minutes from 9:00 AM (540 minutes in 24-hour format)\n    michelle_start = Int('michelle_start')\n    michelle_end = Int('michelle_end')\n    robert_start = Int('robert_start')\n    robert_end = Int('robert_end')\n    george_start = Int('george_start')\n    george_end = Int('george_end')\n    william_start = Int('william_start')\n    william_end = Int('william_end')\n\n    # Constraints for each friend's availability window (in minutes since 9:00 AM)\n    # Michelle: 8:15 AM to 2:00 PM (8:15 is -45, 2:00 PM is 300)\n    michelle_available_start = -45  # 8:15 AM is 45 minutes before 9:00 AM\n    michelle_available_end = 300    # 2:00 PM is 5 hours after 9:00 AM (300 minutes)\n    # Robert: 9:00 AM to 1:45 PM (0 to 285 minutes)\n    robert_available_start = 0\n    robert_available_end = 285      # 1:45 PM is 4 hours 45 minutes after 9:00 AM\n    # George: 10:30 AM to 6:45 PM (90 to 585 minutes)\n    george_available_start = 90     # 10:30 AM is 1.5 hours after 9:00 AM\n    george_available_end = 585      # 6:45 PM is 9 hours 45 minutes after 9:00 AM\n    # William: 6:30 PM to 8:45 PM (570 to 705 minutes)\n    william_available_start = 570   # 6:30 PM is 9.5 hours after 9:00 AM\n    william_available_end = 705     # 8:45 PM is 11 hours 45 minutes after 9:00 AM\n\n    # Minimum durations in minutes\n    michelle_min_duration = 15\n    robert_min_duration = 30\n    george_min_duration = 30\n    william_min_duration = 105\n\n    # Add constraints for each meeting's duration and availability\n    s.add(michelle_start >= michelle_available_start)\n    s.add(michelle_end <= michelle_available_end)\n    s.add(michelle_end -

Constraints ensure each meeting fits within the friend's availability window and meets the minimum duration.\n2. **Travel Times**: The sequence of meetings is assumed to be Michelle \u2192 Robert \u2192 George \u2192 William, with travel times between locations added as constraints on the start times of subsequent meetings.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible schedule is found, the start and end times are converted back to HH:MM format and formatted into a JSON output. If no solution is found, an error message is returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected and the itinerary is optimized to meet all friends within their available times."
