The solution attempts to meet all friends while respecting their availability and travel times. The output will list the meetings in chronological order if a valid schedule is found.\n\nNote: This is a simplified version and may not always find the optimal schedule due to the complexity of the problem. A more advanced approach would involve sequencing variables and more sophisticated constraints to handle travel times and meeting order more accurately."
