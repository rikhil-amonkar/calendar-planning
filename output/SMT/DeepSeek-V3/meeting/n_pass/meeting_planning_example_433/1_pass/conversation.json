Emily will be at Richmond District from 7:00PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 15 minutes. Margaret will be at Financial District from 4:30PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 75 minutes. Ronald will be at North Beach from 6:30PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 45 minutes. Deborah will be at The Castro from 1:45PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Deborah for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:15AM to 2:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The `minutes_to_time` function converts back to HH:MM format.\n2. **Travel Times**: A dictionary holds travel times between each pair of locations.\n3. **Friends' Data**: Each friend's data includes their name, location, availability window, and minimum meeting duration.\n4. **Z3 Variables and Constraints**: For each friend, Z3 variables represent the start and end times of their meeting. Constraints ensure meetings fit within availability windows and meet duration requirements.\n5. **Travel Constraints**: The solver ensures that travel time between consecutive meetings is accounted for by adding constraints that the next meeting starts after the previous one ends plus travel time.\n6. **Solution Extraction**: If the solver finds a valid schedule, the meetings are extracted and formatted into a JSON output sorted by start time.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules meetings while respecting all constraints using the Z3 solver's capabilities to handle complex logical and arithmetic constraints."
