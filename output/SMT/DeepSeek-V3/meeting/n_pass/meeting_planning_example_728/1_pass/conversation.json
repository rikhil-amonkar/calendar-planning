Constraints ensure:\n   - Meetings occur within the friend's availability.\n   - Meetings last at least the minimum duration.\n   - Travel times between consecutive meetings are respected.\n4. **Solving**: The solver checks if a valid schedule exists. If so, it prints the schedule sorted by start time.\n\nThis program ensures you meet all friends while respecting all constraints. The output will show the optimal schedule with start and end times for each meeting."
