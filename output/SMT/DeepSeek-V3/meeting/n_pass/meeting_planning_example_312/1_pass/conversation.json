Sarah will be at Sunset District from 10:45AM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 30 minutes. Richard will be at Haight-Ashbury from 11:45AM to 3:45PM. You'd like to meet Richard for a minimum of 90 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Mission District from 11:00AM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 120 minutes. Michelle will be at Golden Gate Park from 6:15PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Michelle for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

Constraints ensure meetings fit within availability windows, account for travel times, and do not overlap.\n4. **Order of Meetings**: A predefined order (Elizabeth, Richard, Sarah, Michelle) is used to simplify the scheduling, though dynamic ordering could be implemented for more flexibility.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If the solver finds a feasible schedule, meeting times are converted from minutes since 9:00 AM to HH:MM format and sorted by start time. The result is printed in JSON format.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling problem using Z3 constraints to find a feasible meeting itinerary that meets all specified requirements."
