For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find an optimal itinerary that maximizes the number of friends met while respecting the constraints. The approach involves encoding the problem as a set of constraints and letting Z3 find a feasible schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: For each meeting, we'll define start and end times as variables.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Travel Time**: Ensure that the time between consecutive meetings accounts for travel.\n   - **Meeting Duration**: Each meeting must last at least the specified minimum duration.\n   - **Availability Windows**: Each meeting must occur within the friend's availability window.\n   - **Non-overlapping**: Meetings should not overlap in time.\n3. **Optimization**: While Z3 can't directly maximize the number of meetings (since all meetings are mandatory based on the problem's phrasing), we'll ensure all meetings fit within the day.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport json\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize Z3 solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables for each meeting's start and end times (in minutes since 9:00 AM)\n    mary_start = Int('mary_start')\n    mary_end = Int('mary_end')\n    lisa_start = Int('lisa_start')\n    lisa_end = Int('lisa_end')\n    betty_start = Int('betty_start')\n    betty_end = Int('betty_end')\n    charles_start = Int('charles_start')\n    charles_end = Int('charles_end')\n\n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes)\n    # Constraints for each meeting's duration and availability window\n    # Mary: Pacific Heights, 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM, min 45 minutes\n    s.add(mary_start >= 60)  # 10:00 AM is 60 minutes after 9:00 AM\n    s.add(mary_end <= 600)   # 7:00 PM is 600 minutes after 9:00 AM (10 hours)\n    s.add(mary_end - mary_start >= 45)\n\n    # Lisa: Mission District, 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM, min 75 minutes\n    s.add(lisa_start >= 690)  # 8:30 PM is 690 minutes after 9:00 AM (11.5 hours)\n    s.add(lisa_end <= 780)    # 10:00 PM is 780 minutes after 9:00 AM (13 hours)\n    s.add(lisa_end - lisa_start >= 75)\n\n    # Betty: Haight-Ashbury, 7:15 AM to 5:15 PM, min 90 minutes\n    # Since we start at 9:00 AM, Betty's window is from 0 (7:15 AM is -105 minutes from 9:00 AM) to 495 (5:15 PM is 8.25 hours after 9:00 AM)\n    # But since we start at 9:00 AM, earliest we can meet is 9:00 AM (0 minutes)\n    s.add(betty_start >= 0)\n    s.add(betty_end <= 495)  # 5:15 PM is 495 minutes after 9:00 AM (8.25 hours)\n    s.add(betty_end - betty_start >= 90)\n\n    # Charles: Financial District, 11:15 AM to 3:00 PM, min 120 minutes\n    s.add(charles_start >= 135)  # 11:15 AM is 135 minutes after 9:00 AM\n    s.add(charles_end <= 360)    # 3:00 PM is 360 minutes after 9:00 AM (6 hours)\n    s.add(charles_end - charles_start >= 120)\n\n    # Define the order of meetings and travel times\n    # We need to decide the sequence of meetings.

Travel times between locations are also added as constraints to ensure sufficient time is allocated for moving between meetings.\n3. **Ordering**: The meetings are ordered as Betty (Haight-Ashbury), Charles (Financial District), Mary (Pacific Heights), and Lisa (Mission District). This order is chosen heuristically to fit within the day's constraints.\n4. **Time Conversion**: The solution converts the Z3 model's output (minutes since 9:00 AM) back into a 24-hour HH:MM format for readability.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the itinerary of meetings.\n\nThis approach ensures that all meetings are scheduled within their respective availability windows, with sufficient time allocated for travel and meeting durations. The Z3 solver efficiently finds a feasible schedule that meets all constraints."
