        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal schedule that allows us to meet as many friends as possible within their available time windows while respecting the travel times between locations. We'll use the Z3 solver to model this as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, and whether each meeting is scheduled (a boolean variable for each friend).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Time Windows**: Each meeting must start and end within the friend's available time window.\n   - **Duration**: Each meeting must last at least the minimum required duration.\n   - **Travel Time**: Ensure sufficient time to travel between consecutive meetings.\n   - **Non-overlapping**: Meetings should not overlap in time.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (or the total time spent with friends, depending on preference).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    #
