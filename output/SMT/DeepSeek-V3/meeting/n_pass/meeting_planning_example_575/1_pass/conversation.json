Rebecca will be at Presidio from 6:15PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Rebecca for a minimum of 60 minutes. Linda will be at Sunset District from 3:30PM to 7:45PM. You'd like to meet Linda for a minimum of 30 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Haight-Ashbury from 5:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 105 minutes. William will be at Mission District from 1:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 30 minutes. Robert will be at Golden Gate Park from 2:15PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 45 minutes. Mark will be at Russian Hill from 10:00AM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

It then attempts to find a feasible schedule that meets all constraints. The resulting itinerary is printed in JSON format, sorted by start time.\n\nThe output will be a JSON dictionary with the optimal meeting schedule, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied. Here's an example of the expected output format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mark\", \"start_time\": \"10:18\", \"end_time\": \"11:33\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"William\", \"start_time\": \"13:15\", \"end_time\": \"13:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"14:15\", \"end_time\": \"15:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Linda\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Elizabeth\", \"start_time\": \"17:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Rebecca\", \"start_time\": \"19:15\", \"end_time\": \"20:15\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
