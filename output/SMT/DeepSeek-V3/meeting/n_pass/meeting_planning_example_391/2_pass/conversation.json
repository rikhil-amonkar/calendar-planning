Each meeting must fit within the friend's availability window and last for the specified minimum duration.\n2. **Travel Times**: We account for travel times between locations. The sequence starts at Sunset District, then moves to Alamo Square, Russian Hill, Presidio, and finally Financial District.\n3. **Solver Check**: The Z3 solver checks if all constraints can be satisfied. If a solution exists, it prints the schedule; otherwise, it indicates no valid schedule was found.\n\nThis approach ensures that all meetings are scheduled within the given constraints, optimizing the number of friends you can meet in a day."

This version ensures that the model values are correctly converted to integers.\n2. **Time Conversion**: The `minutes_to_time` function now properly formats the time in `HH:MM` format.\n3. **Constraint Logic**: The constraints are explicitly defined to ensure meetings do not overlap and account for travel times.\n\nThis solution should now correctly output a valid schedule or indicate if no valid schedule exists.
