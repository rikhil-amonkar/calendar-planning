The solver attempts to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints. The solution will output the optimal schedule if one exists.\n\nNote that this is a simplified approach and may not cover all possible edge cases. For a more robust solution, you might need to model the order of meetings more explicitly or use a more sophisticated scheduling algorithm."
