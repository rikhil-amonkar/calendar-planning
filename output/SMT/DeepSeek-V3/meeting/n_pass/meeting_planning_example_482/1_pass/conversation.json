Stephanie will be at Mission District from 8:15AM to 1:45PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 90 minutes. Sandra will be at Bayview from 1:00PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 15 minutes. Richard will be at Pacific Heights from 7:15AM to 10:15AM. You'd like to meet Richard for a minimum of 75 minutes. Brian will be at Russian Hill from 12:15PM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 120 minutes. Jason will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:30AM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find an optimal itinerary that meets all the constraints and maximizes the number of friends met. The approach involves defining variables for the start and end times of each meeting, ensuring they fit within the friends' availability windows, and accounting for travel times between locations.\n\n### Solution Approach:\n1. **Define Variables**: For each friend, define start and end times of the meeting.\n2. **Add Constraints**:\n   - Each meeting must start and end within the friend's availability window.\n   - The duration of each meeting must meet the minimum required time.\n   - Travel time between consecutive meetings must be accounted for.\n3. **Optimize**: The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, so we'll prioritize meetings that fit within the schedule without overlapping or violating constraints.\n\n### SOLUTION:\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport json\n\ndef solve_scheduling_problem():\n    #
