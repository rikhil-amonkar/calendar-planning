Constraints ensure that meetings fit within the friends' availability windows, meet the minimum duration, and account for travel times between consecutive meetings.\n4. **Solving the Model**: The solver checks for a feasible schedule that meets all constraints. If a solution exists, it prints the schedule with the start and end times for each meeting.\n\nThis approach ensures that you meet as many friends as possible while respecting all constraints. The Z3 solver efficiently handles the complex interplay of time and travel constraints to find an optimal schedule."
