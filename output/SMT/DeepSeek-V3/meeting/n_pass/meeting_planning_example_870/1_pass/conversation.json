Constraints ensure meetings fit within availability windows and last the required duration.\n4. **Travel Times**: The travel times between locations are defined in a dictionary. Constraints ensure sufficient time is allocated for travel between consecutive meetings.\n5. **Scheduling Order**: A heuristic order is used to sequence meetings, prioritizing friends with earlier availability.\n6. **Solver Check**: The solver checks if a valid schedule exists. If so, the itinerary is constructed by converting times back to HH:MM format and formatting the output as JSON.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, leveraging the Z3 solver to find an optimal or feasible solution."
