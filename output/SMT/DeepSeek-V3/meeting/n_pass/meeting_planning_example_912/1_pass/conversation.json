Each meeting must start within the friend's available window and last at least the minimum duration.\n   - Travel times between consecutive meetings are enforced to ensure no overlaps.\n5. **Solving**: The solver checks if a valid schedule exists. If so, it prints the schedule sorted by start time.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are met, and the schedule is optimized to meet as many friends as possible."
