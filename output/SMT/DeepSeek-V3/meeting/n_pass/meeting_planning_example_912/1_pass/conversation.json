times at each friend's location. It enforces constraints based on travel times and meeting durations, and maximizes the total meeting time. The solution will print the optimal schedule if one exists.\n\nNote: The actual output will depend on the solver's ability to find a feasible schedule that meets all constraints. The program may need adjustments based on the specific requirements or additional constraints."
