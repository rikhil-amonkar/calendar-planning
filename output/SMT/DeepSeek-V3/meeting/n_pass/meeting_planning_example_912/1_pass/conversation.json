Kimberly will be at Presidio from 3:30PM to 4:00PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 15 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Alamo Square from 7:15PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 15 minutes. Joshua will be at Marina District from 10:30AM to 2:15PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 45 minutes. Sandra will be at Financial District from 7:30PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 45 minutes. Kenneth will be at Nob Hill from 12:45PM to 9:45PM.

takes to travel between each pair of locations.\n2. **Friends' Constraints**: Each friend's availability is defined with a start and end time, location, and minimum meeting duration.\n3. **Time Conversion**: The `time_to_minutes` and `minutes_to_time` functions convert between time strings and minutes since 9:00 AM for easier arithmetic.\n4. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver is initialized, and variables are created for each meeting's start time, end time, and duration.\n5. **Constraints**:\n   - Each meeting must start and end within the friend's availability window.\n   - The meeting duration must be at least the minimum required.\n   - No overlapping meetings, accounting for travel times between locations.\n6. **Optimization**: The solver maximizes the total meeting duration.\n7. **Output**: If a solution is found, the itinerary is printed in JSON format, sorted by start time.\n\nThis approach ensures that the schedule meets as many friends as possible while respecting all constraints."
