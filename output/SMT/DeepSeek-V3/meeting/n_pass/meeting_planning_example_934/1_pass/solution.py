    # Order of meetings is a permutation of friends
    # We need to sequence meetings with travel times
    # This is complex, so we'll model the order as a list and enforce constraints

    # We'll create a list of possible orders and enforce constraints
    # But for simplicity, let's assume a certain order and adjust with constraints

    # Alternatively, we can model the problem by assigning each meeting to a time slot with travel constraints
    # But this is complex; instead, we'll prioritize certain meetings based on their constraints

    # For the sake of this problem, let's prioritize meetings that have tight windows first
    # For example, Thomas is only available from 19:15 to 19:45, so we must schedule him during that time

    # Let's attempt to find a feasible schedule by manually ordering and checking constraints

    # We'll use a list to represent the order of meetings and enforce travel times
    # This is a heuristic approach; a full solution would require more complex modeling

    # For now, let's proceed with a feasible order based on the constraints

    # Let's try to meet Richard first (available from 8:00 AM to 6:45 PM)
    # Since we start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM, travel to Chinatown takes 6 minutes
    # So meet Richard from 9:06 to 9:36

    # Then, next meeting could be Sarah at Union Square from 11:45 to 14:30
    # Travel from Chinatown to Union Square takes 7 minutes
    # So leave Chinatown at 9:36, arrive Union Square at 9:43
    # But Sarah's window starts at 11:45, so we have free time until then

    # Next, meet Sarah from 11:45 to 13:15 (90 minutes)

    # Then, travel to Karen at Russian Hill: Union Square to Russian Hill is 13 minutes
    # Arrive at 13:28, but Karen's window starts at 13:15
    # So meet Karen from 13:28 to 15:28 (120 minutes)

    # Then, travel to Daniel at Pacific Heights: Russian Hill to Pacific Heights is 7 minutes
    # Arrive at 15:35, Daniel's window is until 20:30
    # Meet Daniel from 15:35 to 15:50 (15 minutes)

    # Then, travel to Mark at Golden Gate Park: Pacific Heights to Golden Gate Park is 16 minutes
    # Arrive at 16:06, Mark's window starts at 17:30
    # So wait until 17:30, meet from 17:30 to 19:30 (120 minutes)

    # Then, travel to Thomas at North Beach: Golden Gate Park to North Beach is 23 minutes
    # Arrive at 19:53, but Thomas's window ends at 19:45
    # This doesn't work, so adjust

    # Alternative: after Daniel, go to Kenneth at The Castro
    # Pacific Heights to The Castro is 16 minutes
    # Arrive at 16:06, Kenneth's window is until 19:15
    # Meet Kenneth from 16:06 to 16:36 (30 minutes)

    # Then, travel to Mark at Golden Gate Park: The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes
    # Arrive at 16:47, Mark's window starts at 17:30
    # Wait until 17:30, meet from 17:30 to 19:30

    # Then, travel to Thomas at North Beach: Golden Gate Park to North Beach is 23 minutes
    # Arrive at 19:53, but Thomas's window ends at 19:45
    # Still doesn't work

    # Another alternative: after Mark, go to Joseph at Haight-Ashbury
    # Golden Gate Park to Haight-Ashbury is 7 minutes
    # Arrive at 19:37, Joseph's window starts at 20:00
    # But we need to meet Thomas before 19:45
    # This is conflicting

    # It seems challenging to meet all friends. Let's try to meet as many as possible.

    # Here's a feasible schedule (meeting some friends):
