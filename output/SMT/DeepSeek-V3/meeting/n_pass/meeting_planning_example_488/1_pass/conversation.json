Ronald will be at Nob Hill from 10:00AM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Ronald for a minimum of 105 minutes. Sarah will be at Russian Hill from 7:15AM to 9:30AM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 45 minutes. Helen will be at The Castro from 1:30PM to 5:00PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Joshua will be at Sunset District from 2:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 90 minutes. Margaret will be at Haight-Ashbury from 10:15AM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Margaret for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to optimize the itinerary to meet as many friends as possible while respecting the travel times and the constraints provided. We'll use the Z3 solver to model the problem and find a feasible schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: We'll define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, ensuring they fit within the friends' availability windows. We'll also account for travel times between locations.\n2. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met or the total time spent with friends, while meeting the minimum required time for each friend.\n3. **Travel Times**: Ensure that the time taken to travel between locations is accounted for between consecutive meetings.\n4. **Order of Meetings**: The order in which we meet friends can affect the feasibility of the schedule, so we'll need to consider all possible permutations or let Z3 handle the ordering.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    #
