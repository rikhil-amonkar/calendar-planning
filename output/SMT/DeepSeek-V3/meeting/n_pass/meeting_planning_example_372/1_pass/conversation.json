The approach involves modeling the problem with variables for arrival and departure times at each location, ensuring travel times and meeting durations are respected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, and the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - Ensure that the arrival time at a friend's location plus the meeting duration does not exceed the friend's availability window.\n   - Account for travel times between locations.\n   - Ensure the schedule is feasible (i.e., no overlapping meetings and sufficient time for travel).\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met or the total time spent with friends.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables for each meeting's start and end times\n    # Margaret at Russian Hill (9:00AM - 4:00PM), min 30 mins\n    margaret_start = Int('margaret_start')\n    margaret_end = Int('margaret_end')\n    \n    # Daniel at Golden Gate Park (8:00AM - 1:30PM), min 15 mins\n    daniel_start = Int('daniel_start')\n    daniel_end = Int('daniel_end')\n    \n    # Charles at Alamo Square (6:00PM - 8:45PM), min 90 mins\n    charles_start = Int('charles_start')\n    charles_end = Int('charles_end')\n    \n    # Stephanie at Mission District (8:30PM - 10:00PM), min 90 mins\n    stephanie_start = Int('stephanie_start')\n    stephanie_end = Int('stephanie_end')\n\n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    # Arrival at Sunset District at 9:00AM (time = 0)\n    start_time = 0  # 9:00AM is time 0 for the solver\n\n    # Constraints for Margaret (Russian Hill)\n    s.add(margaret_start >= start_time + 24)  # Travel from Sunset to Russian Hill: 24 mins\n    s.add(margaret_start >= 540 + 0)  # Margaret available from 9:00AM (540 mins since midnight)\n    s.add(margaret_end == margaret_start + 30)  # Minimum 30 minutes\n    s.add(margaret_end <= 540 + 420)  # 4:00PM is 960 mins since midnight (540 + 420 = 960)\n\n    # Constraints for Daniel (Golden Gate Park)\n    s.add(daniel_start >= start_time + 11)  # Travel from Sunset to Golden Gate Park: 11 mins\n    s.add(daniel_start >= 480)  # Daniel available from 8:00AM (480 mins since midnight)\n    s.add(daniel_end == daniel_start + 15)  # Minimum 15 minutes\n    s.add(daniel_end <= 810)  # 1:30PM is 810 mins since midnight (540 + 150 = 690?

Let me re-examine the time handling.\n\nThe initial time is 9:00 AM, which is 540 minutes since midnight. But in the solver, we treat 9:00 AM as time 0 (start_time = 0).

This simplifies travel time calculations.\n- **Constraints**: Each friend's meeting window and minimum duration are enforced. Travel times between locations are accounted for in the sequence of meetings.\n- **Order of Meetings**: The assumed order is Daniel (Golden Gate Park) \u2192 Margaret (Russian Hill) \u2192 Charles (Alamo Square) \u2192 Stephanie (Mission District). This sequence is chosen to fit within the friends' availability windows and travel times.\n- **Output**: The schedule is printed with meeting times converted back to a readable format (HH:MM).\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are met, and the schedule is feasible, allowing you to meet all four friends within their available times."
