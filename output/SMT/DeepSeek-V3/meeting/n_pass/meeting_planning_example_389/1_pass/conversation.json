The solver ensures that meetings start and end within the friend's availability and account for travel time.\n4. **Objective**: The solver maximizes the number of friends met by setting up an objective function.\n5. **Output**: The solution prints the optimal schedule, showing when and where to meet each friend, and the total number of friends met.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while optimizing the number of friends you can meet."
