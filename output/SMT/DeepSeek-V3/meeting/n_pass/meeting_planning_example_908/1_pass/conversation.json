        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal schedule that allows us to meet as many friends as possible while respecting the time constraints and travel times between locations. We'll use the Z3 solver to model this as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: For each friend, we'll define variables for the start and end times of the meeting. These times must fall within the friend's availability window.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Duration**: Each meeting must last at least the minimum required time.\n   - **Travel Time**: The time between consecutive meetings must account for travel between locations.\n   - **Non-overlapping**: Meetings should not overlap in time.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met or the total time spent with friends.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    #

Constraints ensure meetings fit within availability windows and last the required duration.\n4. **Travel Constraints**: For each pair of meetings, constraints ensure that either one meeting occurs before the other with sufficient travel time or vice versa.\n5. **Initial Conditions**: The solver starts from the Financial District at 9:00 AM, ensuring the first meeting accounts for travel time from this location.\n6. **Optimization**: The solver maximizes the number of friends met. If a solution is found, it prints the schedule with meeting times converted back to readable formats.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, leveraging Z3's capabilities to find an optimal schedule."
