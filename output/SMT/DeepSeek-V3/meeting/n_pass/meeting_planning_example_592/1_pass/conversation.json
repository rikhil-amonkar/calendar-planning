James will be at Pacific Heights from 8:00PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet James for a minimum of 120 minutes. Robert will be at Chinatown from 12:15PM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Robert for a minimum of 90 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Union Square from 9:30AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 120 minutes. Carol will be at Mission District from 6:15PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Carol for a minimum of 15 minutes. Mark will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:30AM to 5:45PM. You'd like to meet Mark for a minimum of 15 minutes. Sandra will be at Nob Hill from 8:00AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Sandra for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The output is a JSON-formatted dictionary with the itinerary.\n\nThe solution may not always meet all friends due to time constraints, but it will try to maximize the number of meetings. The actual output will depend on the solver's ability to find a feasible schedule."
