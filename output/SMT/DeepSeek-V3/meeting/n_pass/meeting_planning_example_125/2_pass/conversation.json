Stephanie will be at Financial District from 8:15AM to 11:30AM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 90 minutes. John will be at Alamo Square from 10:15AM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet John for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.
