If a meeting is scheduled, it must fit within the friend's availability and meet the minimum duration.\n   - Travel time to the friend's location is accounted for before the meeting starts.\n   - The current time and location are updated after each meeting.\n5. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n6. **Output**: The solution prints the names of friends met and their meeting times.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are satisfied while maximizing the number of friends you can meet in a day."
