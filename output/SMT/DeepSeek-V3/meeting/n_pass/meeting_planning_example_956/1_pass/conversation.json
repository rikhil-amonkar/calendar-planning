William will be at Alamo Square from 3:15PM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 60 minutes. Joshua will be at Richmond District from 7:00AM to 8:00PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 15 minutes. Joseph will be at Financial District from 11:15AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Joseph for a minimum of 15 minutes. David will be at Union Square from 4:45PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 45 minutes. Brian will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 1:45PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 105 minutes. Karen will be at Marina District from 11:30AM to 6:30PM. You'd like to meet Karen for a minimum of 15 minutes.

You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 120 minutes. Helen will be at Pacific Heights from 8:00AM to 12:00PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 75 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Golden Gate Park from 7:00PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 60 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"
