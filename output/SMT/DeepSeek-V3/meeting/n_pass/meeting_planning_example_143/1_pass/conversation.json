        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal times to meet Karen and Mark while adhering to the given constraints. We'll use the Z3 solver to find a feasible schedule that maximizes the time spent with friends.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the start and end times of meetings with Karen and Mark, as well as travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The meeting durations must meet the minimum requirements (90 minutes with Karen and 120 minutes with Mark).\n   - The meetings must occur within the friends' availability windows.\n   - Travel times between locations must be accounted for when moving from one meeting to another.\n   - The start time at North Beach is fixed at 9:00 AM.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the total time spent with friends, which in this case is fixed (90 + 120 minutes), so we just need to find a feasible schedule.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes since midnight)\n    # Constants\n    karen_start_available = (18 * 60 + 45) -

`meet_mark_start` and `meet_mark_end` represent the start and end times of the meeting with Mark.\n   - `meet_karen_start` and `meet_karen_end` represent the start and end times of the meeting with Karen.\n   - `meet_mark_first` is a boolean indicating whether Mark is met before Karen.\n3. **Travel Times**: The travel times between locations are factored into the constraints to ensure feasible transitions between meetings.\n4. **Feasibility Check**: The solver checks if there's a schedule that meets all constraints. If found, it prints the meeting times in a readable format.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are satisfied, and the optimal schedule is found using the Z3 solver."
