        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal times to meet Karen and Mark while respecting the travel times between locations and the minimum meeting durations. We'll use the Z3 solver to model the constraints and find a feasible schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, as well as the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting with Mark must start and end within his availability window (1:00 PM to 5:45 PM) and last at least 120 minutes.\n   - The meeting with Karen must start and end within her availability window (6:45 PM to 8:15 PM) and last at least 90 minutes.\n   - Ensure that there is enough time to travel between locations if the meetings are in different places.\n   - The initial location is North Beach at 9:00 AM.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the time spent with friends, which in this case is fixed (90 minutes with Karen and 120 minutes with Mark), so we just need to ensure the constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes)\n    # Karen's availability: 6:45 PM (18:45) to 8:15 PM (20:15) -> 18*60 + 45 = 1125 to 20*60 + 15 = 1215\n    # Mark's availability: 1:00 PM (13:00) to 5:45 PM (17:45) -> 13*60 = 780 to 17*60 + 45 = 1065\n\n    # Define variables for meeting start and end times\n    mark_start = Int('mark_start')\n    mark_end = Int('mark_end')\n    karen_start = Int('karen_start')\n    karen_end = Int('karen_end')\n\n    # Define travel variables\n    # We start at North Beach at 9:00 AM (540 minutes)\n    # Possible sequences:\n    # 1. North Beach -> Embarcadero (meet Mark) -> Pacific Heights (meet Karen)\n    # 2. North Beach -> Pacific Heights (but Karen is only available in the evening, so this is not feasible)\n    # So the only feasible sequence is to meet Mark first, then Karen.\n\n    # Travel from North Beach to Embarcadero: 6 minutes\n    arrival_embarcadero = 540 + 6  # 9:00 AM + 6 minutes = 9:06 AM\n\n    # Meeting Mark must start after arrival at Embarcadero and within his window (780 to 1065)\n    s.add(mark_start >= arrival_embarcadero)\n    s.add(mark_start >= 780)  # 1:00 PM\n    s.add(mark_end <= 1065)   # 5:45 PM\n    s.add(mark_end == mark_start + 120)  # 120 minutes meeting\n\n    # Travel from Embarcadero to Pacific Heights: 11 minutes\n    departure_embarcadero = mark_end\n    arrival_pacific_heights = departure_embarcadero + 11\n\n    # Meeting Karen must start after arrival at Pacific Heights and within her window (1125 to 1215 - 90)\n    s.add(karen_start >= arrival_pacific_heights)\n    s.add(karen_start >= 1125)  # 6:45 PM\n    s.add(karen_end <= 1215)    # 8:15 PM\n    s.add(karen_end == karen_start + 90)  # 90 minutes meeting\n\n    # Check if the constraints are satisfiable\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        # Convert times back to hours and minutes\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            total_minutes = minutes\n            h = total_minutes // 60\n            m = total_minutes % 60\n            return f\"{h}:{m:02d}\"\n\n        mark_start_time = m.evaluate(mark_start).as_long()\n        mark_end_time = m.evaluate(mark_end).as_long()\n        karen_start_time = m.evaluate(karen_start).as_long()\n        karen_end_time = m.evaluate(karen_end).as_long()\n\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Meet Mark from {minutes_to_time(mark_start_time)} to {minutes_to_time(mark_end_time)}\")\n        print(f\"Travel to Pacific Heights, arriving at {minutes_to_time(arrival_pacific_heights)}\")\n        print(f\"Meet Karen from {minutes_to_time(karen_start_time)} to {minutes_to_time(karen_end_time)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No feasible schedule found.\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All times are converted into minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes) for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Variables**: The start and end times for meetings with Mark and Karen are defined as integer variables.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - **Mark's Meeting**: Must start after arriving at Embarcadero (9:06 AM) and within his availability (1:00 PM to 5:45 PM), lasting exactly 120 minutes.\n   - **Travel to Pacific Heights**: After meeting Mark, travel time to Pacific Heights is 11 minutes.\n   - **Karen's Meeting**: Must start after arriving at Pacific Heights and within her availability (6:45 PM to 8:15 PM), lasting exactly 90 minutes.\n4. **Solution Check**: The solver checks if the constraints are satisfiable. If yes, it prints the schedule with times converted back to a readable format.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are met, and the optimal schedule is found using the Z3 solver."
