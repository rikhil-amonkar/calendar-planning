We'll use the Z3 solver to find a feasible schedule that meets all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: Define start and end times for each meeting, and the start times for travel between locations.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Durations**: Ensure each meeting lasts the minimum required time.\n   - **Travel Times**: Account for the time taken to travel between locations.\n   - **Time Windows**: Ensure meetings occur within the friends' availability windows.\n   -

Constraints ensure that each meeting fits within the friend's availability window and meets the minimum duration requirement.\n2. **Travel Times**: The solver accounts for travel times between locations, ensuring that the schedule is feasible without overlapping meetings.\n3. **Sequence**: The solver checks a feasible sequence where Barbara is met first, followed by Betty, and then David, ensuring all constraints are satisfied.\n4. **Output**: The solution converts the meeting times from minutes since midnight back to a 24-hour format and outputs the itinerary as a JSON-formatted dictionary.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules all meetings while respecting travel times and availability constraints, ensuring optimal use of the available time."
