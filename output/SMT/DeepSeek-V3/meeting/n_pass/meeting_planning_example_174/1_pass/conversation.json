Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8.\nNob Hill to Mission District: 13.\nPacific Heights to Nob Hill: 8.\nPacific Heights to Mission District: 15.\nMission District to Nob Hill: 12.\nMission District to Pacific Heights: 16.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00AM. Thomas will be at Pacific Heights from 3:30PM to 7:15PM. You'd like to meet Thomas for a minimum of 75 minutes. Kenneth will be at Mission District from 12:00PM to 3:45PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find an optimal schedule that allows us to meet both friends while respecting the travel times and meeting duration constraints. The goal is to maximize the time spent with friends, ensuring that we meet both Thomas and Kenneth for at least the specified minimum durations.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Variables**: Define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, as well as the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - Ensure that the meeting durations are at least the specified minimums.\n   - Ensure that travel times between locations are accounted for.\n   - Ensure that meetings do not overlap and fit within the friends' availability windows.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the total time spent with friends, which in this case is fixed (75 + 45 minutes), so we just need to find a feasible schedule.\n\n### Solution Code:\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables\n    # Time spent with Kenneth (Mission District)\n    meet_kenneth_start = Int('meet_kenneth_start')  # in minutes from 9:00AM\n    meet_kenneth_end = Int('meet_kenneth_end')\n    \n    # Time spent with Thomas (Pacific Heights)\n    meet_thomas_start = Int('meet_thomas_start')    # in minutes from 9:00AM\n    meet_thomas_end = Int('meet_thomas_end')\n    \n    # Travel times (already given, but we need to model the transitions)\n    # Nob Hill to Mission District: 13 minutes\n    # Mission District to Pacific Heights: 16 minutes\n    # Nob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes\n    # etc.\n\n    # Convert friend availability windows to minutes from 9:00AM\n    # Kenneth is available from 12:00PM to 3:45PM (180 to 405 minutes from 9:00AM)\n    kenneth_start_avail = 180  # 12:00PM is 3 hours after 9:00AM\n    kenneth_end_avail = 405     # 3:45PM is 6 hours and 45 minutes after 9:00AM\n    \n    # Thomas is available from 3:30PM to 7:15PM (390 to 615 minutes from 9:00AM)\n    thomas_start_avail = 390    # 3:30PM is 6 hours and 30 minutes after 9:00AM\n    thomas_end_avail = 615      # 7:15PM is 10 hours and 15 minutes after 9:00AM\n    \n    # Meeting duration constraints\n    s.add(meet_kenneth_end - meet_kenneth_start >= 45)  # At least 45 minutes with Kenneth\n    s.add(meet_thomas_end - meet_thomas_start >= 75)    # At least 75 minutes with Thomas\n    \n    # Meeting must be within friend's availability\n    s.add(meet_kenneth_start >= kenneth_start_avail)\n    s.add(meet_kenneth_end <= kenneth_end_avail)\n    s.add(meet_thomas_start >= thomas_start_avail)\n    s.add(meet_thomas_end <= thomas_end_avail)\n    \n    # Initial location: Nob Hill at time 0 (9:00AM)\n    \n    # Possible schedules:\n    # Option 1: Nob Hill -> Mission District (meet Kenneth) -> Pacific Heights (meet Thomas)\n    # Option 2: Nob Hill -> Pacific Heights (meet Thomas) -> Mission District (meet Kenneth)\n    # Option 2 is impossible because Thomas's availability is after Kenneth's.\n    # So only Option 1 is feasible.\n    \n    # Travel from Nob Hill to Mission District takes 13 minutes\n    s.add(meet_kenneth_start >= 0 + 13)\n    \n    # Travel from Mission District to Pacific Heights takes 16 minutes\n    s.add(meet_thomas_start >= meet_kenneth_end + 16)\n    \n    # Check if the schedule is feasible\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        # Convert times back to hours and minutes\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            total_minutes = minutes\n            hours = total_minutes // 60\n            mins = total_minutes % 60\n            return f\"{9 + hours}:{mins:02d}\"\n        \n        k_start = m.eval(meet_kenneth_start).as_long()\n        k_end = m.eval(meet_kenneth_end).as_long()\n        t_start = m.eval(meet_thomas_start).as_long()\n        t_end = m.eval(meet_thomas_end).as_long()\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Meet Kenneth at Mission District from {minutes_to_time(k_start)} to {minutes_to_time(k_end)}\")\n        print(f\"Then travel to Pacific Heights and meet Thomas from {minutes_to_time(t_start)} to {minutes_to_time(t_end)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No feasible schedule found.\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Variables**: The start and end times for meetings with Kenneth and Thomas are defined as integer variables.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The meeting durations must be at least 45 minutes for Kenneth and 75 minutes for Thomas.\n   - Meetings must occur within the friends' availability windows (Kenneth: 12:00PM-3:45PM, Thomas: 3:30PM-7:15PM).\n   - Travel times are accounted for: 13 minutes from Nob Hill to Mission District and 16 minutes from Mission District to Pacific Heights.\n3. **Feasibility Check**: The solver checks if a feasible schedule exists that meets all constraints. If so, it prints the schedule with times converted back to a readable format.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are satisfied and the optimal schedule is found."
