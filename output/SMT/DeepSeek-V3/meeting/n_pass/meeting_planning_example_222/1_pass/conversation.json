Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nNob Hill to North Beach: 8.\nNob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf: 11.\nNob Hill to Bayview: 19.\nNorth Beach to Nob Hill: 7.\nNorth Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: 5.\nNorth Beach to Bayview: 22.\nFisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill: 11.\nFisherman's Wharf to North Beach: 6.\nFisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26.\nBayview to Nob Hill: 20.\nBayview to North Beach: 21.\nBayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00AM. Helen will be at North Beach from 7:00AM to 4:45PM. You'd like to meet Helen for a minimum of 120 minutes. Kimberly will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:30PM to 9:00PM. You'd like to meet Kimberly for a minimum of 45 minutes. Patricia will be at Bayview from 6:00PM to 9:15PM. You'd like to meet Patricia for a minimum of 120 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find an optimal itinerary that meets all the constraints. The goal is to maximize the number of friends met while adhering to the time constraints and travel times between locations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Variables**: We'll define variables for the start and end times of each meeting with friends (Helen, Kimberly, Patricia), and the travel times between locations.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The start time of the first meeting (Helen) must be after the arrival time at Nob Hill (9:00 AM), accounting for travel time to North Beach.\n   - Each meeting must last at least the specified minimum duration.\n   - The end time of one meeting plus the travel time to the next location must be before the start time of the next meeting.\n   - All meetings must fit within the friends' availability windows.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met, which in this case is all three, given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport datetime\n\ndef solve_scheduling_problem():\n    #

If so, it returns the optimal meeting times in HH:MM format.\n\nThis approach ensures that all meetings are scheduled within the friends' availability windows while accounting for travel times between locations."
