Kenneth will be at Richmond District from 9:15PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Kenneth for a minimum of 30 minutes. Lisa will be at Union Square from 9:00AM to 4:30PM. You'd like to meet Lisa for a minimum of 45 minutes. Joshua will be at Financial District from 12:00PM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 15 minutes. Nancy will be at Pacific Heights from 8:00AM to 11:30AM. You'd like to meet Nancy for a minimum of 90 minutes. Andrew will be at Nob Hill from 11:30AM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Andrew for a minimum of 60 minutes. John will be at Bayview from 4:45PM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet John for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find an optimal itinerary that maximizes the number of friends met while respecting the time constraints and travel times between locations. The approach involves modeling the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem where we define variables for the start and end times of each meeting, ensuring that they fit within the friends' availability windows and account for travel times between locations.\n\n### Solution Approach:\n1. **Define Variables**: For each friend, define start and end times of the meeting.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Each meeting must last at least the minimum required duration.\n   - Each meeting must start and end within the friend's availability window.\n   - Travel time between consecutive meetings must be accounted for.\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (or total meeting time, depending on preference).\n\n### SOLUTION:\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport json\n\ndef solve_scheduling_problem():\n    # Initialize Z3 solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Friends and their details\n    friends = {\n        \"Kenneth\": {\"location\": \"Richmond District\", \"available_start\": \"21:15\", \"available_end\": \"22:00\", \"min_duration\": 30},\n        \"Lisa\": {\"location\": \"Union Square\", \"available_start\": \"09:00\", \"available_end\": \"16:30\", \"min_duration\": 45},\n        \"Joshua\": {\"location\": \"Financial District\", \"available_start\": \"12:00\", \"available_end\": \"15:15\", \"min_duration\": 15},\n        \"Nancy\": {\"location\": \"Pacific Heights\", \"available_start\": \"08:00\", \"available_end\": \"11:30\", \"min_duration\": 90},\n        \"Andrew\": {\"location\": \"Nob Hill\", \"available_start\": \"11:30\", \"available_end\": \"20:15\", \"min_duration\": 60},\n        \"John\": {\"location\": \"Bayview\", \"available_start\": \"16:45\", \"available_end\": \"21:30\", \"min_duration\": 75}\n    }\n\n    # Convert time strings to minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes)\n    def time_to_minutes(time_str):\n        hh, mm = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n        return hh * 60 + mm\n\n    # Convert minutes back to time string\n    def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n        hh = minutes // 60\n        mm = minutes % 60\n        return f\"{hh:02d}:{mm:02d}\"\n\n    # Initialize variables for each friend's meeting start and end times\n    meeting_vars = {}\n    for name in friends:\n        start_var = Int(f'start_{name}')\n        end_var = Int(f'end_{name}')\n        meeting_vars[name] = {'start': start_var, 'end': end_var}\n\n        # Constraints: meeting duration >= min_duration\n        s.add(end_var - start_var >= friends[name][\"min_duration\"])\n\n        # Constraints: meeting within friend's availability\n        available_start = time_to_minutes(friends[name][\"available_start\"])\n        available_end = time_to_minutes(friends[name][\"available_end\"])\n        s.add(start_var >= available_start)\n        s.add(end_var <= available_end)\n\n    # Travel times between locations (simplified as symmetric for this example)\n    travel_times = {\n        (\"Embarcadero\", \"Richmond District\"): 21,\n        (\"Embarcadero\", \"Union Square\"): 10,\n        (\"Embarcadero\", \"Financial District\"): 5,\n        (\"Embarcadero\", \"Pacific Heights\"): 11,\n        (\"Embarcadero\", \"Nob Hill\"): 10,\n        (\"Embarcadero\", \"Bayview\"): 21,\n        # Add other travel times as needed\n    }\n\n    # Assume starting at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM (540 minutes)\n    current_location = \"Embarcadero\"\n    current_time = 540  # 9:00 AM in minutes\n\n    # Order of meetings (this is a simplification;
