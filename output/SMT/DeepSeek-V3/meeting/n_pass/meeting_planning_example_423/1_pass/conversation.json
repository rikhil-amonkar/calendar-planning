Jason will be at Richmond District from 1:00PM to 8:45PM. You'd like to meet Jason for a minimum of 90 minutes. Melissa will be at North Beach from 6:45PM to 8:15PM. You'd like to meet Melissa for a minimum of 45 minutes. Brian will be at Financial District from 9:45AM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 15 minutes. Elizabeth will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:45AM to 9:30PM. You'd like to meet Elizabeth for a minimum of 105 minutes. Laura will be at Union Square from 2:15PM to 7:30PM. You'd like to meet Laura for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of meeting entries.\nEach meeting entry should have the following format:\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<person_name>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}\nThe time should be in 24-hour format. For example:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

If not, the start and end times are set to -1.\n5. **Optimization**: The solver maximizes the number of friends met by summing the boolean variables.\n6. **Output**: The solution is formatted as a JSON dictionary with the itinerary sorted by start time.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are satisfied while maximizing the number of friends met. The Z3 solver handles the complex scheduling logic efficiently."
