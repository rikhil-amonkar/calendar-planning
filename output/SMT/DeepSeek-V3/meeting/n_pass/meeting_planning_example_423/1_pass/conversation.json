If they are not met, the meeting times are set to zero.\n5. **Optimization**: We maximize the number of friends met by summing the boolean variables indicating whether a friend is met.\n6. **Solution**: If a solution exists, we print the optimal schedule, including the start and end times for each meeting and the total number of friends met.\n\nThis approach ensures that we meet as many friends as possible while respecting their availability and travel times."
