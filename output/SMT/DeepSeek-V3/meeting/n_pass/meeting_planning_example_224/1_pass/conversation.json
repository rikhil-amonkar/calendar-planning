Constraints ensure these times fall within the friends' availability windows and meet the minimum duration requirements.\n2. **Travel Times**: The model accounts for travel times between locations. For example, traveling from Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park takes 25 minutes, so Melissa's meeting cannot start before 9:25 AM.\n3. **Order of Meetings**: The meetings are scheduled in the order Melissa \u2192 Emily \u2192 Nancy. This order is chosen based on the friends' availability and travel times between locations.\n4. **Time Conversion**: The solution converts the computed times (in minutes since 9:00 AM) back to a readable HH:MM format for the output.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are met, and the optimal schedule is generated to meet all three friends within the given time frames."
