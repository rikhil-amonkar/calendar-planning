You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diane and Matthew for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nDiane is busy on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 15:30, Tuesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 15:30 to 16:30, Friday during 9:30 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \nMatthew has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 16:00, Friday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nMatthew would rather not meet on Wednesday before 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints that ensure the meeting time does not overlap with any existing busy slots for both participants and adheres to their preferences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the day, start time, and duration of the meeting. The day will be represented as an integer (0 to 4 for Monday to Friday), and the start time will be in minutes from 9:00 AM (540 minutes, since 9 AM is 9*60 = 540 minutes into the day).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must start and end within 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes).\n   - **Duration**: The meeting duration is 60 minutes.\n   - **Busy Slots**: For each participant, the meeting should not overlap with any of their busy slots. We'll iterate through each participant's busy slots and add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with any of these slots.\n   - **Preferences**: Matthew prefers not to meet on Wednesday before 12:30 (750 minutes, since 12:30 is 12*60 + 30 = 750 minutes from midnight, but our start time is from 9:00 AM, so 750 - 540 = 210 minutes from 9:00 AM). If the day is Wednesday (day 2), the start time must be \u2265 210 minutes from 9:00 AM (i.e., \u2265 12:30 PM).\n3. **Solve and Output**: After setting up all constraints, we'll solve the model and output the solution in the required format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday, 3: Thursday, 4: Friday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 0 means 9:00, 60 means 10:00, etc.)\n\n    # Constants\n    meeting_duration = 60  # minutes\n    work_start = 0  # 9:00 is 0 minutes from 9:00\n    work_end = 8 * 60  # 17:00 is 8*60=480 minutes from 9:00 (540 to 1020 in day minutes)\n\n    # Constraints for day and start time\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 4)  # Monday to Friday\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Define busy slots for Diane and Matthew\n    # Each slot is (day, start_min, end_min) where start_min and end_min are from 9:00 as 0\n    diane_busy = [\n        (0, 3*60, 3*60 + 30),  # Monday 12:00-12:30 (3h from 9:00)\n        (0, 6*60, 6*60 + 30),   # Monday 15:00-15:30\n        (1, 1*60, 2*60),        # Tuesday 10:00-11:00\n        (1, 2*60 + 30, 3*60),   # Tuesday 11:30-12:00\n        (1, 3*60 + 30, 4*60),   # Tuesday 12:30-13:00\n        (1, 7*60, 8*60),        # Tuesday 16:00-17:00\n        (2, 0, 30),             # Wednesday 9:00-9:30\n        (2, 5*60 + 30, 6*60),   # Wednesday 14:30-15:00\n        (2, 7*60 + 30, 8*60),   # Wednesday 16:30-17:00\n        (3, 6*60 + 30, 7*60 + 30),  # Thursday 15:30-16:30\n        (4, 30, 2*60 + 30),     # Friday 9:30-11:30\n        (4, 5*60 + 30, 6*60),   # Friday 14:30-15:00\n        (4, 7*60, 8*60)         # Friday 16:00-17:00\n    ]\n\n    matthew_busy = [\n        (0, 0, 1*60),           # Monday 9:00-10:00\n        (0, 1*60 + 30, 8*60),   # Monday 10:30-17:00\n        (1, 0, 8*60),           # Tuesday 9:00-17:00\n        (2, 0, 2*60),           # Wednesday 9:00-11:00\n        (2, 3*60, 5*60 + 30),   # Wednesday 12:00-14:30\n        (2, 7*60, 8*60),        # Wednesday 16:00-17:00\n        (3, 0, 7*60),           # Thursday 9:00-16:00\n        (4, 0, 8*60)            # Friday 9:00-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Function to add no-overlap constraints\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(busy_slots):\n        for (d, busy_start, busy_end) in busy_slots:\n            s.add(Not(And(\n                day == d,\n                start_time < busy_end,\n                start_time + meeting_duration > busy_start\n            )))\n\n    # Add constraints for Diane and Matthew\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(diane_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(matthew_busy)\n\n    # Matthew's preference: not Wednesday before 12:30 (which is 3h30 from 9:00 = 210 minutes)\n    s.add(Not(And(day == 2, start_time < 3*60 + 30)))  # 3*60 +30 = 210 minutes (12:30 is 3h30 from 9:00)\n\n    # Check for solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert day_val to day name\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n        day_name = days[day_val]\n\n        # Calculate start and end times in HH:MM format\n        total_minutes_start = 540 + start_val  # 9:00 is 540 minutes\n        hours_start = total_minutes_start // 60\n        minutes_start = total_minutes_start % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours_start:02d}:{minutes_start:02d}\"\n\n        total_minutes_end = total_minutes_start + meeting_duration\n        hours_end = total_minutes_end // 60\n        minutes_end = total_minutes_end % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{hours_end:02d}:{minutes_end:02d}\"\n\n        # Print solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The solver uses integer variables for the day and start time. The day is constrained to be between 0 (Monday) and 4 (Friday), and the start time must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n2. **Busy Slots Handling**: For each participant, their busy slots are converted into constraints that prevent the meeting from overlapping with any of these slots. The solver checks that the meeting does not start during or overlap with any busy period.\n3. **Preferences Handling**: An additional constraint ensures that if the meeting is on Wednesday, it starts at or after 12:30 PM.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: Once a solution is found, the day and start time are converted from numerical values into readable strings (e.g., day 2 becomes \"Wednesday\", and start time 210 minutes from 9:00 AM becomes 12:30 PM).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint programming, ensuring all conditions are met before proposing a solution."
