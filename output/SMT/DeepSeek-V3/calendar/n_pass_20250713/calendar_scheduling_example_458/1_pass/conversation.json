You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Wayne, Melissa, Catherine, Gregory, Victoria, Thomas and Jennifer for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nWayne is free the entire day.\nMelissa has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nCatherine is free the entire day.\nGregory has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nVictoria is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \nThomas has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:00; \nJennifer has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nWayne would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we can use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling each participant's availability as constraints and then finding a time slot that satisfies all constraints, including preferences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem**: The meeting must be scheduled on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00, lasting 30 minutes. Each participant's busy times are converted into constraints that the meeting cannot overlap with.\n2. **Handle Preferences**: Wayne prefers no meetings before 14:00, so we add a constraint that the meeting must start at or after 14:00.\n3. **Check for Valid Slots**: The solver will check all possible 30-minute slots within the given time frame, ensuring no overlap with any participant's busy times and respecting Wayne's preference.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the possible meeting start times (in minutes from 9:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (480 minutes from 9:00)\n    min_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    max_time = 17 * 60 - meeting_duration  # Latest start time is 16:30\n\n    # Constraint: start_time must be within work hours\n    s.add(start_time >= min_time, start_time <= max_time)\n\n    # Wayne's preference: avoid meetings before 14:00\n    s.add(start_time >= 14 * 60)\n\n    # Define each participant's busy times in minutes from 9:00\n    # Format: list of (start, end) intervals\n    busy_times = {\n        'Melissa': [(10*60, 11*60), (12*60 + 30, 14*60), (15*60, 15*60 + 30)],\n        'Gregory': [(12*60 + 30, 13*60), (15*60 + 30, 16*60)],\n        'Victoria': [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (10*60 + 30, 11*60 + 30), (13*60, 14*60), (14*60 + 30, 15*60), (15*60 + 30, 16*60 + 30)],\n        'Thomas': [(10*60, 12*60), (12*60 + 30, 13*60), (14*60 + 30, 16*60)],\n        'Jennifer': [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (10*60, 10*60 + 30), (11*60, 13*60), (13*60 + 30, 14*60 + 30), (15*60, 15*60 + 30), (16*60, 16*60 + 30)],\n    }\n\n    # For each participant, add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with their busy times\n    for person in busy_times:\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_times[person]:\n            # The meeting does not overlap with this busy interval\n            s.add(Or(\n                start_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start,\n                start_time >= busy_end\n            ))\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_minutes = model[start_time].as_long()\n        start_hh = start_minutes // 60\n        start_mm = start_minutes % 60\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hh = end_minutes // 60\n        end_mm = end_minutes % 60\n\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Solver Setup**: The Z3 solver is initialized to find an integer value for `start_time` representing the meeting's start time in minutes from 9:00.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start between 9:00 and 16:30 (to end by 17:00).\n   - Wayne's preference is enforced by ensuring the start time is at or after 14:00.\n   - For each participant, their busy intervals are converted into constraints that the meeting must not overlap with any of these intervals.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a valid start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format, and the meeting's start and end times are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint programming, ensuring all participants' schedules and preferences are respected."
