You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Mary and Alexis for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMary has meetings on Tuesday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30; \nAlexis has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 10:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the constraints of each participant's schedule and finding the earliest possible time slot that satisfies all conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We will define variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day will be represented as an integer (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, etc.), and the start and end times will be integers representing minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes, since 9:00 AM is 540 minutes past midnight).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Day Constraint**: The meeting must be on one of the specified days (Monday to Thursday).\n   - **Time Constraints**: The meeting must start and end within working hours (9:00 to 17:00), and the duration must be exactly 30 minutes.\n   - **Availability Constraints**: The selected time slot must not overlap with any existing meetings for either participant.\n3. **Objective**: Find the earliest possible meeting time. This is achieved by minimizing the start time, which is a combination of the day and the start time within that day.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday, 3: Thursday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 00:00\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n\n    # Define the constraints for day and time\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 3)  # Monday to Thursday\n    # Working hours 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540, end_time <= 1020)\n    s.add(end_time == start_time + 30)  # 30 minutes duration\n\n    # Mary's busy times (each entry is (day, start, end) in minutes from 00:00)\n    mary_busy = [\n        (1, 600, 630),   # Tuesday 10:00-10:30\n        (1, 930, 960),    # Tuesday 15:30-16:00\n        (2, 570, 600),    # Wednesday 9:30-10:00\n        (2, 900, 930),    # Wednesday 15:00-15:30\n        (3, 540, 600),    # Thursday 9:00-10:00\n        (3, 630, 690)     # Thursday 10:30-11:30\n    ]\n\n    # Alexis's busy times\n    alexis_busy = [\n        (0, 540, 600),    # Monday 9:00-10:00\n        (0, 630, 720),    # Monday 10:30-12:00\n        (0, 750, 990),    # Monday 12:30-16:30\n        (1, 540, 600),    # Tuesday 9:00-10:00\n        (1, 630, 690),    # Tuesday 10:30-11:30\n        (1, 720, 930),    # Tuesday 12:00-15:30\n        (1, 960, 1020),   # Tuesday 16:00-17:00\n        (2, 540, 660),     # Wednesday 9:00-11:00\n        (2, 690, 1020),    # Wednesday 11:30-17:00\n        (3, 600, 720),     # Thursday 10:00-12:00\n        (3, 840, 870),     # Thursday 14:00-14:30\n        (3, 930, 960),     # Thursday 15:30-16:00\n        (3, 990, 1020)     # Thursday 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Function to check if two intervals overlap\n    def overlaps(a_start, a_end, b_start, b_end):\n        return Or(\n            And(a_start >= b_start, a_start < b_end),\n            And(a_end > b_start, a_end <= b_end),\n            And(a_start <= b_start, a_end >= b_end)\n        )\n\n    # Add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with Mary's busy times\n    for m_day, m_start, m_end in mary_busy:\n        s.add(Not(And(day == m_day, overlaps(start_time, end_time, m_start, m_end)))\n\n    # Add constraints for Alexis's busy times\n    for a_day, a_start, a_end in alexis_busy:\n        s.add(Not(And(day == a_day, overlaps(start_time, end_time, a_start, a_end))))\n\n    # To find the earliest time, we minimize (day * 1440 + start_time)\n    # 1440 is the number of minutes in a day\n    opt = Optimize()\n    opt.add(s.assertions())\n    cost = day * 1440 + start_time\n    opt.minimize(cost)\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if opt.check() == sat:\n        model = opt.model()\n        d = model[day].as_long()\n        st = model[start_time].as_long()\n        et = model[end_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert day to string\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\"]\n        day_str = days[d]\n\n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            h = minutes // 60\n            m = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n\n        start_str = minutes_to_time(st)\n        end_str = minutes_to_time(et)\n\n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variable Definitions**: The variables `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are defined to represent the meeting day and time slot.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting is within working hours (9:00 to 17:00) and exactly 30 minutes long. It also checks that the meeting does not overlap with any existing meetings for Mary or Alexis.\n3. **Overlap Check**: The `overlaps` function checks if the proposed meeting time conflicts with any blocked time slots for either participant.\n4. **Optimization**: The solver minimizes the cost function, which combines the day and start time to find the earliest feasible slot.\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed in the required format, converting the day index and minute values back to human-readable strings.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving and optimization to find the earliest available slot that meets all given constraints."
