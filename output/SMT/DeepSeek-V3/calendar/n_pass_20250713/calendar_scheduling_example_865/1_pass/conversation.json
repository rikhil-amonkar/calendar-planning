You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Megan and Daniel for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMegan has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Thursday during 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nDaniel is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the constraints of each participant's schedule and finding the earliest possible time slot that satisfies all conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We will create variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day will be represented as an integer (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, etc.), and the start and end times will be in minutes since 9:00 AM (the start of the workday).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Day Constraint**: The meeting must occur on one of the specified days (Monday to Thursday).\n   - **Time Constraints**: The meeting must start and end within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and last exactly one hour.\n   - **Availability Constraints**: The meeting time must not overlap with any existing meetings for either participant.\n3. **Objective**: Find the earliest possible meeting time. This is achieved by minimizing the start time, considering the day as a higher priority (earlier days first).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday, 3: Thursday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (540 in 24-hour format)\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n\n    # Constraints for day\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 3)  # Monday to Thursday\n\n    # Meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes)\n    s.add(end_time == start_time + 60)\n\n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes in 24-hour format)\n    s.add(start_time >= 0)  # 9:00 is 0 minutes from 9:00\n    s.add(end_time <= 480)   # 17:00 is 480 minutes from 9:00 (since 17:00 - 9:00 = 8 hours = 480 minutes)\n\n    # Megan's busy times (converted to minutes from 9:00)\n    megan_busy = {\n        0: [(13*60 - 540, 13*60 + 30 - 540),  # Monday 13:00-13:30 \u2192 240-270\n            (14*60 - 540, 15*60 + 30 - 540)],  # 14:00-15:30 \u2192 300-390\n        1: [(9*60 - 540, 9*60 + 30 - 540),     # Tuesday 9:00-9:30 \u2192 0-30\n            (12*60 - 540, 12*60 + 30 - 540),    # 12:00-12:30 \u2192 180-210\n            (16*60 - 540, 17*60 - 540)],        # 16:00-17:00 \u2192 420-480\n        2: [(9*60 + 30 - 540, 10*60 - 540),     # Wednesday 9:30-10:00 \u2192 30-60\n            (10*60 + 30 - 540, 11*60 + 30 - 540), # 10:30-11:30 \u2192 90-150\n            (12*60 + 30 - 540, 14*60 - 540),      # 12:30-14:00 \u2192 210-300\n            (16*60 - 540, 16*60 + 30 - 540)],     # 16:00-16:30 \u2192 420-450\n        3: [(13*60 + 30 - 540, 14*60 + 30 - 540), # Thursday 13:30-14:30 \u2192 270-330\n            (15*60 - 540, 15*60 + 30 - 540)]       # 15:00-15:30 \u2192 360-390\n    }\n\n    # Daniel's busy times\n    daniel_busy = {\n        0: [(10*60 - 540, 11*60 + 30 - 540),     # Monday 10:00-11:30 \u2192 60-150\n            (12*60 + 30 - 540, 15*60 - 540)],     # 12:30-15:00 \u2192 210-360\n        1: [(9*60 - 540, 10*60 - 540),            # Tuesday 9:00-10:00 \u2192 0-60\n            (10*60 + 30 - 540, 17*60 - 540)],     # 10:30-17:00 \u2192 90-480\n        2: [(9*60 - 540, 10*60 - 540),            # Wednesday 9:00-10:00 \u2192 0-60\n            (10*60 + 30 - 540, 11*60 + 30 - 540),  # 10:30-11:30 \u2192 90-150\n            (12*60 - 540, 17*60 - 540)],           # 12:00-17:00 \u2192 180-480\n        3: [(9*60 - 540, 12*60 - 540),             # Thursday 9:00-12:00 \u2192 0-180\n            (12*60 + 30 - 540, 14*60 + 30 - 540),  # 12:30-14:30 \u2192 210-330\n            (15*60 - 540, 15*60 + 30 - 540),       # 15:00-15:30 \u2192 360-390\n            (16*60 - 540, 17*60 - 540)]            # 16:00-17:00 \u2192 420-480\n    }\n\n    # Function to add no-overlap constraints\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(day_var, start, end, busy_slots):\n        for d in busy_slots:\n            for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_slots[d]:\n                s.add(Not(And(day_var == d,\n                              Or(And(start < busy_end, end > busy_start))))\n    \n    add_no_overlap_constraints(day, start_time, end_time, megan_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(day, start_time, end_time, daniel_busy)\n\n    # Find the earliest possible time: prioritize earlier days, then earlier start times\n    # We'll use optimization to find the minimal day and start_time\n    opt = Optimize()\n    opt.add(s.assertions())\n    opt.minimize(day * 10000 + start_time)  # day is higher priority\n\n    if opt.check() == sat:\n        model = opt.model()\n        d = model[day].as_long()\n        st = model[start_time].as_long()\n        et = model[end_time].as_long()\n\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\"]\n        selected_day = days[d]\n        \n        # Convert start_time and end_time back to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = 9 + st // 60\n        start_min = st % 60\n        end_hour = 9 + et // 60\n        end_min = et % 60\n\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_min:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_min:02d}\"\n\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {selected_day}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**:\n   - **day**: An integer representing the day of the week (0 to 3 for Monday to Thursday).\n   - **start_time** and **end_time**: Integers representing minutes from 9:00 AM. The meeting duration is constrained to be exactly 60 minutes (end_time = start_time + 60).\n   - **Work Hours Constraint**: Ensures the meeting starts no earlier than 9:00 AM (start_time \u2265 0) and ends no later than 5:00 PM (end_time \u2264 480 minutes from 9:00 AM).\n\n2. **Busy Times Handling**:\n   - Each participant's busy times are converted into minutes from 9:00 AM and stored in dictionaries (megan_busy and daniel_busy) for each day.\n   - The `add_no_overlap_constraints` function ensures the meeting does not overlap with any busy slots for either participant.\n\n3. **Optimization**:\n   - The Z3 optimizer is used to find the earliest possible meeting time by minimizing a composite value (day * 10000 + start_time), prioritizing earlier days first, then earlier start times within the day.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - The solution is printed in the required format, converting the start and end times back to HH:MM format from minutes since 9:00 AM.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving and optimization to find the earliest feasible slot."
