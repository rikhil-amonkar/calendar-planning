You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Cheryl and Kyle for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nCheryl is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 15:00 to 15:30; \nKyle is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nCheryl can not meet on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints that must be satisfied to find a valid meeting time. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting.\n2. **Set Constraints**: \n   - The meeting must be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n   - The meeting duration must be exactly 30 minutes.\n   - The meeting must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any busy times of the participants.\n   - Cheryl cannot meet on Wednesday.\n3. **Solve the Constraints**: Use Z3 to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.\n4. **Output the Solution**: Format the solution as specified.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling_problem():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define possible days (0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 2)  # Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday\n\n    # Define start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= 540, start_time <= 1020 - 30)  # 17:00 is 1020 minutes, meeting is 30 mins\n\n    # Convert start_time to HH:MM format for constraints\n    def time_to_hhmm(minutes):\n        hh = minutes // 60\n        mm = minutes % 60\n        return hh, mm\n\n    # Cheryl cannot meet on Wednesday (day 2)\n    s.add(day != 2)\n\n    # Define busy times for Cheryl and Kyle\n    # Each busy time is (day, start_min, end_min)\n    cheryl_busy = [\n        (0, 540, 570),   # Monday 9:00-9:30\n        (0, 690, 780),    # Monday 11:30-13:00\n        (0, 930, 960),    # Monday 15:30-16:00\n        (1, 900, 930),    # Tuesday 15:00-15:30\n    ]\n\n    kyle_busy = [\n        (0, 540, 1020),   # Monday 9:00-17:00\n        (1, 570, 1020),   # Tuesday 9:30-17:00\n        (2, 540, 570),     # Wednesday 9:00-9:30\n        (2, 600, 780),     # Wednesday 10:00-13:00\n        (2, 810, 840),     # Wednesday 13:30-14:00\n        (2, 870, 1020),    # Wednesday 14:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with busy times\n    meeting_end = start_time + 30\n\n    # For Cheryl's busy times\n    for (busy_day, busy_start, busy_end) in cheryl_busy:\n        s.add(Not(And(day == busy_day,\n                      Or(And(start_time >= busy_start, start_time < busy_end),\n                         And(meeting_end > busy_start, meeting_end <= busy_end),\n                         And(start_time <= busy_start, meeting_end >= busy_end)))))\n\n    # For Kyle's busy times\n    for (busy_day, busy_start, busy_end) in kyle_busy:\n        s.add(Not(And(day == busy_day,\n                      Or(And(start_time >= busy_start, start_time < busy_end),\n                         And(meeting_end > busy_start, meeting_end <= busy_end),\n                         And(start_time <= busy_start, meeting_end >= busy_end)))))\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_min = m[start_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert day and time to required format\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_str = days[day_val]\n\n        hh = start_min // 60\n        mm = start_min % 60\n        start_str = f\"{hh:02d}:{mm:02d}\"\n\n        end_min = start_min + 30\n        hh = end_min // 60\n        mm = end_min % 60\n        end_str = f\"{hh:02d}:{mm:02d}\"\n\n        # Print the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling_problem()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Variables**: \n   - `day` represents the day of the meeting (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, 2 for Wednesday).\n   - `start_time` represents the start time of the meeting in minutes from midnight (e.g., 540 minutes is 9:00 AM).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday (`day` between 0 and 2).\n   - The meeting must start between 9:00 (540 minutes) and 16:30 (990 minutes) to ensure it ends by 17:00.\n   - Cheryl cannot meet on Wednesday (`day != 2`).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any busy times of Cheryl or Kyle. This is enforced by ensuring the meeting does not start or end during any busy interval.\n\n3. **Solution Extraction**:\n   - If a solution is found (`s.check() == sat`), the model is queried for the values of `day` and `start_time`.\n   - The day is converted to a string (e.g., \"Monday\"), and the start and end times are formatted as \"HH:MM\".\n\nThis code will output the first valid meeting time that satisfies all constraints. The solution is formatted as specified."
