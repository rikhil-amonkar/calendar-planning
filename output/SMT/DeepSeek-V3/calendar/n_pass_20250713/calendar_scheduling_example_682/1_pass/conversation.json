        "content": "Given the following scheduling problem:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amanda and Nathan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nAmanda is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nNathan is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nAmanda do not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00. Nathan can not meet on Monday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the problem constraints into Z3 variables and then checking for a feasible solution that satisfies all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll represent each possible meeting time slot (on Monday or Tuesday) as a Z3 variable. The meeting duration is fixed at 30 minutes.\n2. **Extract Busy Slots**: For each participant, we'll note their busy intervals on both days.\n3. **Apply Constraints**: \n   - The meeting must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any busy intervals of either participant.\n   - Amanda does not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00.\n   - Nathan cannot meet on Monday.\n4. **Check for Solution**: Use Z3 to find a time slot that meets all constraints. If found, convert the solution into the required output format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Possible days: Monday (0) or Tuesday (1)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1))\n\n    # Meeting start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    end_time = start_time + meeting_duration\n\n    # Working hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540)  # 9:00 in minutes\n    s.add(end_time <= 1020)   # 17:00 in minutes\n\n    # Amanda's busy slots in minutes from start of day (9:00 is 0)\n    amanda_busy = {\n        0: [(540, 630), (660, 690), (750, 780), (810, 840), (870, 900)],  # Monday\n        1: [(540, 570), (600, 630), (690, 720), (810, 900), (930, 960), (990, 1020)]  # Tuesday\n    }\n\n    # Nathan's busy slots in minutes from start of day (9:00 is 0)\n    nathan_busy = {\n        0: [(600, 630), (660, 690), (810, 900), (960, 990)],  # Monday\n        1: [(540, 630), (660, 780), (810, 840), (870, 930), (960, 990)]  # Tuesday\n    }\n\n    # Amanda does not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00 (660 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(Implies(day == 1, start_time < 660))\n\n    # Nathan cannot meet on Monday\n    s.add(day != 0)\n\n    # Function to check if the meeting overlaps with any busy interval\n    def no_overlap(day_val, start, end, busy_intervals):\n        constraints = []\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_intervals.get(day_val, []):\n            constraints.append(Or(end <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n        return And(*constraints) if constraints else True\n\n    # Add constraints for Amanda's busy times\n    amanda_no_overlap = no_overlap(day, start_time, end_time, amanda_busy)\n    s.add(amanda_no_overlap)\n\n    # Add constraints for Nathan's busy times\n    nathan_no_overlap = no_overlap(day, start_time, end_time, nathan_busy)\n    s.add(nathan_no_overlap)\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        day_val = model[day].as_long()\n        start_min = model[start_time].as_long()\n\n        # Determine day name\n        day_name = \"Monday\" if day_val == 0 else \"Tuesday\"\n\n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = start_min // 60\n        start_mm = start_min % 60\n        end_min = start_min + meeting_duration\n        end_hh = end_min // 60\n        end_mm = end_min % 60\n\n        # Format the times as strings with leading zeros\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: \n   - `day` is an integer variable representing Monday (0) or Tuesday (1).\n   - `start_time` is an integer variable representing the meeting start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes from midnight).\n   - Constraints ensure the meeting fits within working hours (9:00 to 17:00, or 540 to 1020 minutes).\n\n2. **Busy Intervals Handling**:\n   - Amanda's and Nathan's busy intervals are converted into minutes from 9:00 for each day.\n   - The `no_overlap` function generates constraints ensuring the meeting does not overlap with any busy intervals for either participant.\n\n3. **Additional Constraints**:\n   - Amanda's preference to not meet on Tuesday after 11:00 (660 minutes from 9:00) is enforced.\n   - Nathan's unavailability on Monday is enforced by setting `day != 0`.\n\n4. **Solution Extraction**:\n   - If a solution exists, the model is queried for the day and start time.\n   - The start and end times are converted back to HH:MM format for output.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the feasible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring all constraints are satisfied before presenting the solution."
