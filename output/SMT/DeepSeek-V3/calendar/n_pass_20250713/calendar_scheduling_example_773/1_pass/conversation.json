You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Patrick and Roy for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nPatrick's calendar is wide open the entire week.\nRoy is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the participants' schedules and constraints into logical expressions that Z3 can solve. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting duration must be exactly one hour.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of Roy's busy slots on the chosen day.\n   - Patrick's calendar is open, so no constraints are needed for him.\n3. **Preferences**: The group prefers the earliest available time, so we'll find the earliest possible slot by minimizing the start time.\n\nThe Z3 solver will then find a solution that satisfies all constraints, and we'll format the output as specified.\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the possible days (Monday=0, Tuesday=1, Wednesday=2)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 2)\n\n    # Define start and end times in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n\n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540, end_time <= 1020)\n    s.add(end_time == start_time + 60)  # Meeting duration is 1 hour\n\n    # Roy's busy slots for each day in minutes from 9:00\n    # Format: (day, start, end)\n    roy_busy = [\n        # Monday\n        (0, 600, 690),   # 10:00-11:30\n        (0, 720, 780),   # 12:00-13:00\n        (0, 840, 870),    # 14:00-14:30\n        (0, 900, 1020),   # 15:00-17:00\n        # Tuesday\n        (1, 630, 690),    # 10:30-11:30\n        (1, 720, 870),    # 12:00-14:30\n        (1, 900, 930),    # 15:00-15:30\n        (1, 960, 1020),   # 16:00-17:00\n        # Wednesday\n        (2, 570, 690),    # 9:30-11:30\n        (2, 750, 840),    # 12:30-14:00\n        (2, 870, 930),    # 14:30-15:30\n        (2, 990, 1020)    # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with Roy's busy slots\n    for busy_day, busy_start, busy_end in roy_busy:\n        s.add(Not(And(day == busy_day,\n                      start_time < busy_end,\n                      end_time > busy_start)))\n\n    # To find the earliest time, we minimize the start_time\n    # We'll use a loop to find the earliest feasible solution\n    earliest_start = None\n    earliest_day = None\n    # Check for solutions in order of days and times\n    for d in [0, 1, 2]:\n        for t in range(540, 1020 - 60 + 1, 15):  # Check every 15 minutes for efficiency\n            temp_s = Solver()\n            temp_s.add(s.assertions())\n            temp_s.add(day == d)\n            temp_s.add(start_time == t)\n            if temp_s.check() == sat:\n                earliest_start = t\n                earliest_day = d\n                break\n        if earliest_start is not None:\n            break\n\n    if earliest_start is None:\n        print(\"SOLUTION: No feasible time found.\")\n    else:\n        # Convert day and time to required format\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        start_hh = earliest_start // 60\n        start_mm = earliest_start % 60\n        end_hh = (earliest_start + 60) // 60\n        end_mm = (earliest_start + 60) % 60\n\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {days[earliest_day]}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Variables and Constraints**:\n   - `day` is an integer representing the day (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, 2=Wednesday).\n   - `start_time` and `end_time` are integers representing minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 540 = 9:00, 600 = 10:00).\n   - The solver ensures the meeting is within work hours (540 to 1020 minutes) and lasts exactly 60 minutes.\n   - Roy's busy slots are encoded as constraints where the meeting cannot overlap.\n\n2. **Finding Earliest Time**:\n   - The loop checks each day and time in order (from earliest to latest) to find the first feasible slot.\n   - Once a valid slot is found, it breaks out of the loop and formats the solution.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - The solution is printed in the specified format, converting the internal representations back to days and 24-hour times.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the earliest possible meeting time that satisfies all constraints using the Z3 solver."
