You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diane, Jack, Eugene and Patricia for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDiane has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nJack has blocked their calendar on Monday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nEugene has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30; \nPatricia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we can use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining the constraints based on each participant's blocked times and then finding a time slot that satisfies all constraints for all participants.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need a variable to represent the start time of the meeting. Since the meeting duration is 30 minutes, the end time will be start time + 30 minutes.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The meeting must fit within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and must not overlap with any blocked times of the participants.\n3. **Blocked Times Handling**: For each participant, the meeting time should not overlap with any of their blocked intervals. This means the meeting should either start and end before a blocked interval or start after it.\n4. **Z3 Solver**: Use the Z3 solver to check the satisfiability of the constraints and find a valid start time if one exists.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (9*60 to 17*60 in minutes)\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Define the start time variable (in minutes since midnight)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Constraint: start time must be within work hours and leave room for the meeting\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n    \n    # Define each participant's blocked time slots in minutes since midnight\n    blocked_slots = {\n        'Diane': [(9*60 + 30, 10*60), (14*60 + 30, 15*60)],\n        'Jack': [(13*60 + 30, 14*60), (14*60 + 30, 15*60)],\n        'Eugene': [(9*60, 10*60), (10*60 + 30, 11*60 + 30), (12*60, 14*60 + 30), (15*60, 16*60 + 30)],\n        'Patricia': [(9*60 + 30, 10*60 + 30), (11*60, 12*60), (12*60 + 30, 14*60), (15*60, 16*60 + 30)]\n    }\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant's blocked slots\n    for participant in blocked_slots:\n        for (block_start, block_end) in blocked_slots[participant]:\n            # The meeting should not overlap with the blocked slot\n            # So either meeting ends before block starts or starts after block ends\n            s.add(Or(\n                start_time + meeting_duration <= block_start,\n                start_time >= block_end\n            ))\n    \n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_minutes = m.evaluate(start_time).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = start_minutes // 60\n        start_minute = start_minutes % 60\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        solution = (\n            f\"SOLUTION:\\n\"\n            f\"Day: Monday\\n\"\n            f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\\n\"\n            f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        )\n        print(solution)\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables and Constraints**: The start time of the meeting is represented as an integer variable in minutes since midnight. Constraints ensure the meeting fits within work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n3. **Blocked Slots Handling**: For each participant, their blocked time slots are converted into minutes. The solver ensures the meeting does not overlap with any blocked intervals by adding constraints that the meeting must either end before a blocked interval starts or start after it ends.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If the solver finds a solution (sat), the start time is converted back to HH:MM format, and the meeting end time is calculated by adding 30 minutes. The solution is printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving, ensuring the solution adheres to all given constraints."
