You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Bradley, Teresa, Elizabeth and Christian for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nBradley has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nTeresa has meetings on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nElizabeth has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nChristian has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we can use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem as a set of constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: We need to find a start time for the meeting such that the meeting duration (30 minutes) fits within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and does not overlap with any of the participants' existing meetings.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start at a time that allows it to end by 17:00.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of the blocked times for any participant.\n   - The meeting must be at least 30 minutes long.\n\n3. **Check Availability**: For each possible 30-minute slot within the work hours, check if all participants are free during that slot.\n\n4. **Solve**: Use Z3 to find a valid start time that satisfies all constraints.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this solution:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60    # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Define the participants' blocked times in minutes since midnight\n    bradley_blocked = [\n        (9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60),      # 9:30-10:00\n        (12 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60),     # 12:30-13:00\n        (13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60),     # 13:30-14:00\n        (15 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60)      # 15:30-16:00\n    ]\n    teresa_blocked = [\n        (10 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60),     # 10:30-11:00\n        (12 * 60, 12 * 60 + 30),     # 12:00-12:30\n        (13 * 60, 13 * 60 + 30),     # 13:00-13:30\n        (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60)      # 14:30-15:00\n    ]\n    elizabeth_blocked = [\n        (9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30),       # 9:00-9:30\n        (10 * 60 + 30, 11 * 60 + 30), # 10:30-11:30\n        (13 * 60, 13 * 60 + 30),     # 13:00-13:30\n        (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60),     # 14:30-15:00\n        (15 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)      # 15:30-17:00\n    ]\n    christian_blocked = [\n        (9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30),       # 9:00-9:30\n        (10 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)      # 10:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Create a Z3 solver instance\n    solver = Solver()\n\n    # Define the start time variable (in minutes since midnight)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n\n    # Add constraints for the start time\n    solver.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    solver.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Function to check if a time range overlaps with any blocked time\n    def no_overlap(start, end, blocked_times):\n        return And([Or(end <= block_start, start >= block_end) for (block_start, block_end) in blocked_times])\n\n    # Add constraints for each participant's availability\n    solver.add(no_overlap(start_time, start_time + meeting_duration, bradley_blocked))\n    solver.add(no_overlap(start_time, start_time + meeting_duration, teresa_blocked))\n    solver.add(no_overlap(start_time, start_time + meeting_duration, elizabeth_blocked))\n    solver.add(no_overlap(start_time, start_time + meeting_duration, christian_blocked))\n\n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model.evaluate(start_time).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = start_minutes // 60\n        start_mm = start_minutes % 60\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hh = end_minutes // 60\n        end_mm = end_minutes % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Work Hours and Meeting Duration**: The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00, and the meeting duration is 30 minutes.\n2. **Blocked Times**: Each participant's blocked times are converted into minutes since midnight for easier comparison.\n3. **Z3 Solver**: The solver is used to find a start time (`start_time`) that fits within the work hours and does not overlap with any blocked times.\n4. **No Overlap Constraint**: The `no_overlap` function ensures that the meeting time does not overlap with any of the blocked times for each participant.\n5. **Output**: If a solution is found, the start and end times are converted back to HH:MM format and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving, ensuring that all participants' schedules are respected."
