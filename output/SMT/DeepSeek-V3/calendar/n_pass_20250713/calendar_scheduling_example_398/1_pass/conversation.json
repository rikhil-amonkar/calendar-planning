You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Doris, Theresa, Christian, Terry, Carolyn and Kyle for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDoris has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nTheresa has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 12:00; \nChristianhas no meetings the whole day.\nTerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nCarolyn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \nKyle has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a time slot that fits all participants' constraints. The approach involves encoding each participant's blocked times as constraints and then finding a 30-minute slot that doesn't overlap with any of these blocked times.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the start time of the meeting in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes, since 9:00 is 9*60 = 540 minutes into the day).\n2. **Constraints Setup**: For each participant, we'll add constraints that the meeting time should not overlap with any of their blocked time slots.\n3. **Solver Setup**: Use the Z3 solver to check for a feasible solution that meets all constraints. The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so the end time is start time + 30 minutes.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: Convert the solution back into a readable time format (HH:MM).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time variable in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes from midnight)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    end_time = start_time + duration\n    \n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540)  # 9:00\n    s.add(end_time <= 1020)   # 17:00\n    \n    # Define each participant's blocked time slots in minutes from midnight\n    # Doris's blocked times: 9:00-11:00 (540-660), 13:30-14:00 (810-840), 16:00-16:30 (960-990)\n    s.add(Or(\n        end_time <= 540,  # before 9:00\n        start_time >= 660,  # after 11:00\n        And(end_time <= 810, start_time >= 660),  # between 11:00 and 13:30\n        And(end_time <= 960, start_time >= 840),  # between 14:00 and 16:00\n        start_time >= 990   # after 16:30\n    ))\n    \n    # Theresa's blocked times: 10:00-12:00 (600-720)\n    s.add(Or(\n        end_time <= 600,\n        start_time >= 720\n    ))\n    \n    # Christian has no meetings, no constraints\n    \n    # Terry's blocked times: 9:30-10:00 (570-600), 11:30-12:00 (690-720), 12:30-13:00 (750-780), \n    # 13:30-14:00 (810-840), 14:30-15:00 (870-900), 15:30-17:00 (930-1020)\n    s.add(Or(\n        end_time <= 570,\n        And(start_time >= 600, end_time <= 690),\n        And(start_time >= 720, end_time <= 750),\n        And(start_time >= 780, end_time <= 810),\n        And(start_time >= 840, end_time <= 870),\n        And(start_time >= 900, end_time <= 930),\n        start_time >= 1020\n    ))\n    \n    # Carolyn's blocked times: 9:00-10:30 (540-630), 11:00-11:30 (660-690), 12:00-13:00 (720-780),\n    # 13:30-14:30 (810-870), 15:00-17:00 (900-1020)\n    s.add(Or(\n        end_time <= 540,\n        And(start_time >= 630, end_time <= 660),\n        And(start_time >= 690, end_time <= 720),\n        And(start_time >= 780, end_time <= 810),\n        And(start_time >= 870, end_time <= 900),\n        start_time >= 1020\n    ))\n    \n    # Kyle's blocked times: 9:00-9:30 (540-570), 11:30-12:00 (690-720), 12:30-13:00 (750-780),\n    # 14:30-17:00 (870-1020)\n    s.add(Or(\n        end_time <= 540,\n        And(start_time >= 570, end_time <= 690),\n        And(start_time >= 720, end_time <= 750),\n        And(start_time >= 780, end_time <= 870),\n        start_time >= 1020\n    ))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_min = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        hours = start_min // 60\n        minutes = start_min % 60\n        start_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_min = start_min + duration\n        hours_end = end_min // 60\n        minutes_end = end_min % 60\n        end_str = f\"{hours_end:02d}:{minutes_end:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables and Constraints**: The start time of the meeting is defined as an integer variable representing minutes from midnight. The meeting must start and end within the 9:00 to 17:00 work hours.\n3. **Blocked Times Handling**: For each participant, constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap with their blocked times. These constraints are formulated using logical ORs to exclude the blocked intervals.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible solution is found, the start time in minutes is converted back to a readable HH:MM format, and the solution is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by systematically applying each participant's constraints and using the solver to find a feasible slot. The solution ensures no overlaps with any blocked times while fitting within the specified work hours."
