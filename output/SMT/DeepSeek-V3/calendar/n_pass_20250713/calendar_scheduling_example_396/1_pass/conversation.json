You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Andrea, Jack, Madison, Rachel, Douglas and Ryan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAndrea's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nJack has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:00 to 14:30; \nMadison has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nRachel is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nDouglas is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 16:30; \nRyan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding each participant's schedule constraints and finding a 30-minute window where all participants are available between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the start time of the meeting in terms of hours and minutes. The meeting duration is fixed at 30 minutes.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: For each participant, we'll add constraints that the meeting time does not overlap with their busy slots. This means the meeting must either start before a busy slot and end before it starts, or start after the busy slot ends.\n3. **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must be entirely within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n4. **Solve and Extract Solution**: Using Z3, we'll solve the constraints and extract the feasible start time, converting it into a readable format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n\n    # Define start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes from midnight)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    # Total minutes in work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 is 8 hours = 480 minutes\n    min_time = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    max_time = 17 * 60 - duration  # 17:00 - 30 minutes = 16:30 in minutes\n\n    # Constraint: start_time must be within work hours considering duration\n    s.add(start_time >= min_time)\n    s.add(start_time <= max_time)\n\n    # Each participant's busy slots in minutes (start, end)\n    # Format: list of (start_minute, end_minute) pairs\n    andrea_busy = []  # Andrea is free all day\n    jack_busy = [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (14*60, 14*60 + 30)]\n    madison_busy = [(9*60 + 30, 10*60 + 30), (13*60, 14*60), (15*60, 15*60 + 30), (16*60 + 30, 17*60)]\n    rachel_busy = [(9*60 + 30, 10*60 + 30), (11*60, 11*60 + 30), (12*60, 13*60 + 30), (14*60 + 30, 15*60 + 30), (16*60, 17*60)]\n    douglas_busy = [(9*60, 11*60 + 30), (12*60, 16*60 + 30)]\n    ryan_busy = [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (13*60, 14*60), (14*60 + 30, 17*60)]\n\n    # Function to add constraints for a participant's busy slots\n    def add_participant_constraints(busy_slots):\n        constraints = []\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_slots:\n            # The meeting does not overlap with the busy slot: it's either entirely before or entirely after\n            constraint = Or(\n                start_time + duration <= busy_start,\n                start_time >= busy_end\n            )\n            constraints.append(constraint)\n        # All constraints must be satisfied (i.e., no overlap with any busy slot)\n        if constraints:\n            s.add(And(*constraints))\n\n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    add_participant_constraints(andrea_busy)\n    add_participant_constraints(jack_busy)\n    add_participant_constraints(madison_busy)\n    add_participant_constraints(rachel_busy)\n    add_participant_constraints(douglas_busy)\n    add_participant_constraints(ryan_busy)\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_minutes = model[start_time].as_long()\n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        hours = start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + duration\n        end_hours = end_minutes // 60\n        end_min = end_minutes % 60\n        end_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_min:02d}\"\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The start time of the meeting is modeled as an integer representing minutes from midnight. The solver checks that this start time, plus the 30-minute duration, fits within the workday (9:00 to 17:00).\n2. **Busy Slots Handling**: For each participant, their busy slots are converted into minute ranges. Constraints ensure the meeting does not overlap with any of these slots.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible start time is found, it is converted back into a 24-hour format for the output. The solution is printed in the specified format, showing the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible time slots within the workday, ensuring the meeting fits into everyone's schedule without overlaps. The Z3 solver handles the complex constraints, providing an optimal solution when one exists."
