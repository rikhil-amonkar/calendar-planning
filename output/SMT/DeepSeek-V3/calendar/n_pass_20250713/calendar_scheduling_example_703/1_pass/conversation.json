        "content": "Given the following scheduling problem:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Stephanie and Betty for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nStephanie has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, Tuesday during 12:00 to 13:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 13:00 to 14:00; \nBetty has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nStephanie would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. Betty can not meet on Tuesday after 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints that represent the participants' schedules and preferences, then finding a valid meeting time that satisfies all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the day, start time, and duration of the meeting. The day will be an integer representing Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. The start time will be an integer representing minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes, since 9:00 AM is 540 minutes past midnight).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must start and end within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - **Duration**: The meeting duration is exactly one hour (60 minutes).\n   - **Existing Meetings**: The meeting must not overlap with any existing meetings for either participant.\n   - **Preferences**: Stephanie prefers to avoid Monday, and Betty cannot meet on Tuesday after 12:30.\n3. **Check for Solutions**: Use the Z3 solver to find a valid assignment of day and start time that meets all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, 2 for Wednesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 00:00 (e.g., 9:00 is 540)\n\n    # Constraints for day: must be 0, 1, or 2 (Mon, Tue, Wed)\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 2)\n\n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540, start_time + 60 <= 1020)\n\n    # Stephanie's existing meetings\n    stephanie_meetings = {\n        0: [(570, 600), (630, 660), (690, 720), (840, 870)],  # Monday\n        1: [(720, 780)],  # Tuesday\n        2: [(540, 600), (780, 840)]  # Wednesday\n    }\n\n    # Betty's existing meetings\n    betty_meetings = {\n        0: [(540, 600), (660, 690), (870, 900), (930, 960)],  # Monday\n        1: [(540, 570), (690, 720), (750, 870), (930, 960)],  # Tuesday\n        2: [(600, 690), (720, 840), (870, 1020)]  # Wednesday\n    }\n\n    # Function to add no-overlap constraints for a person's meetings on a given day\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(day_var, start, person_meetings):\n        for d in person_meetings:\n            for (meeting_start, meeting_end) in person_meetings[d]:\n                # If the meeting is on day d, then the new meeting must not overlap\n                s.add(Not(And(day_var == d,\n                              Or(And(start >= meeting_start, start < meeting_end),\n                                 And(start + 60 > meeting_start, start + 60 <= meeting_end),\n                                 And(start <= meeting_start, start + 60 >= meeting_end))))\n\n    # Add no-overlap constraints for Stephanie and Betty\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(day, start_time, stephanie_meetings)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(day, start_time, betty_meetings)\n\n    # Stephanie prefers to avoid Monday (day 0)\n    s.add(day != 0)\n\n    # Betty cannot meet on Tuesday after 12:30 (750 minutes) if day is Tuesday\n    s.add(Not(And(day == 1, start_time >= 750)))\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert day_val to day string\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_str = days[day_val]\n\n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = start_val // 60\n        start_mm = start_val % 60\n        end_val = start_val + 60\n        end_hh = end_val // 60\n        end_mm = end_val % 60\n\n        # Format the times with leading zeros\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n\n        # Print the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The variables `day` and `start_time` are defined with constraints to ensure they fall within the valid work hours and days.\n2. **Existing Meetings**: The existing meetings for Stephanie and Betty are stored in dictionaries, where each key is a day (0, 1, 2 for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) and the value is a list of tuples representing the start and end times of meetings in minutes past midnight.\n3. **No-Overlap Constraints**: The function `add_no_overlap_constraints` ensures the new meeting does not overlap with any existing meetings for either participant on the chosen day.\n4. **Preferences**: Additional constraints are added to respect Stephanie's preference to avoid Monday and Betty's unavailability on Tuesday after 12:30 (750 minutes).\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the day and times are converted from numerical values to readable strings and printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach systematically models all constraints and uses the Z3 solver to efficiently find a valid meeting time that satisfies all given conditions."
