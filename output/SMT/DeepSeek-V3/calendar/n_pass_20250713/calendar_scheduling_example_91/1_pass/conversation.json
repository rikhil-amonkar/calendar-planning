You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Danielle, Bruce and Eric for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDanielle has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBruce has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nEric has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the participants' schedules and finding a one-hour time slot where all participants are available between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem**: We need to find a start time such that the meeting duration of one hour does not overlap with any of the existing meetings of the participants.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The start time must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting duration is exactly one hour, so the end time is start time + 1 hour.\n   - The meeting should not overlap with any of the existing meetings of Danielle, Bruce, or Eric.\n3. **Z3 Variables and Constraints**:\n   - Use an integer variable to represent the start time in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 0 represents 9:00, 60 represents 10:00, etc.).\n   - The start time must be such that the meeting fits within the working hours (0 \u2264 start_time \u2264 480 - 60, since 17:00 is 480 minutes from 9:00).\n   - For each participant's meetings, ensure the meeting does not overlap. This means the meeting's time slot (start_time, start_time + 60) should not intersect with any of their existing meetings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 = 9:00, 60 = 10:00, etc.)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes)\n    duration = 60\n    \n    # Total working hours from 9:00 to 17:00 is 8 hours = 480 minutes\n    max_time = 480\n    \n    # Constraint: start_time must be >= 0 and <= max_time - duration\n    solver.add(start_time >= 0)\n    solver.add(start_time <= max_time - duration)\n    \n    # Define the existing meetings for each participant in minutes from 9:00\n    # Danielle's meetings: 9:00-10:00 (0-60), 10:30-11:00 (90-120), 14:30-15:00 (330-360), 15:30-16:00 (390-420), 16:30-17:00 (450-480)\n    danielle_meetings = [(0, 60), (90, 120), (330, 360), (390, 420), (450, 480)]\n    \n    # Bruce's meetings: 11:00-11:30 (120-150), 12:30-13:00 (210-240), 14:00-14:30 (300-330), 15:30-16:00 (390-420)\n    bruce_meetings = [(120, 150), (210, 240), (300, 330), (390, 420)]\n    \n    # Eric's meetings: 9:00-9:30 (0-30), 10:00-11:00 (60-120), 11:30-13:00 (150-240), 14:30-15:30 (330-390)\n    eric_meetings = [(0, 30), (60, 120), (150, 240), (330, 390)]\n    \n    # Function to add no-overlap constraints for a participant's meetings\n    def add_no_overlap(meetings):\n        for (m_start, m_end) in meetings:\n            # The meeting does not overlap with m_start..m_end\n            # So either our meeting ends before m_start or starts after m_end\n            solver.add(Or(start_time + duration <= m_start, start_time >= m_end))\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    add_no_overlap(danielle_meetings)\n    add_no_overlap(bruce_meetings)\n    add_no_overlap(eric_meetings)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model.evaluate(start_time).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes back to HH:MM format\n        hours = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_minutes = start_minutes + duration\n        end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Print the solution in the required format\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables**: The start time is represented as an integer in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 0 for 9:00, 60 for 10:00).\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The start time must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00), adjusted to ensure the meeting fits.\n   - For each participant, the solver ensures the meeting does not overlap with any of their existing meetings by checking that the meeting either ends before an existing meeting starts or starts after it ends.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the start time in minutes is converted back to HH:MM format, and the end time is calculated by adding 60 minutes. The solution is printed in the specified format.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible time slots within the working hours to find a one-hour window where all participants are available."
