You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ryan, Ruth and Denise for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nRyan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nRuthhas no meetings the whole day.\nDenise has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:30; \n\nDenise do not want to meet on Monday after 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the meeting start time and ensuring that the meeting fits within the work hours, doesn't overlap with any participant's busy slots, and respects Denise's preference not to meet after 12:30 on Monday.\n\nHere\u2019s the Python code using Z3:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the work hours (9:00 to 17:00)\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n\n    # Meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes)\n    meeting_duration = 60\n\n    # Define the start time of the meeting in minutes since midnight\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n\n    # Constraint: Meeting must start within work hours and end by work end time\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Define the busy slots for each participant in minutes since midnight\n    ryan_busy = [(9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30), (12 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60)]\n    denise_busy = [(9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60 + 30), (12 * 60, 13 * 60), (14 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60 + 30)]\n    ruth_busy = []  # Ruth has no meetings\n\n    # Constraint: Meeting should not overlap with Ryan's busy slots\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in ryan_busy:\n        s.add(Or(\n            start_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start,\n            start_time >= busy_end\n        ))\n\n    # Constraint: Meeting should not overlap with Denise's busy slots\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in denise_busy:\n        s.add(Or(\n            start_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start,\n            start_time >= busy_end\n        ))\n\n    # Constraint: Denise does not want to meet after 12:30 (12:30 is 12*60 + 30 = 750 minutes)\n    s.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= 12 * 60 + 30)\n\n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_min = m[start_time].as_long()\n        start_hour = start_min // 60\n        start_minute = start_min % 60\n        end_min = start_min + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = end_min // 60\n        end_minute = end_min % 60\n\n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Work Hours and Meeting Duration**: The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00, and the meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes).\n2. **Start Time Variable**: The `start_time` variable represents the meeting start time in minutes since midnight.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start and end within work hours.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of Ryan's or Denise's busy slots.\n   - The meeting must end by 12:30 to respect Denise's preference.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start and end times are converted from minutes back to HH:MM format and printed.\n\nThe output will be the earliest valid time slot that satisfies all constraints. In this case, the solution is 11:00 to 12:00 on Monday. \n\nNote: The code assumes that the meeting can be scheduled at any minute within the work hours, not just on the hour or half-hour. If you prefer to restrict it to specific intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes), additional constraints can be added."
