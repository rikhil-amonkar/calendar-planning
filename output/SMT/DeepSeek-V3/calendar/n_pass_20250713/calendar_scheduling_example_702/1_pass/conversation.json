You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Robert and Ralph for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nRobert has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nRalph is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nRobert would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the constraints of each participant's schedule and preferences into logical formulas that Z3 can solve. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be 30 minutes long.\n   - It must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n   - It must not overlap with any existing meetings of Robert or Ralph.\n   - Robert prefers to avoid more meetings on Monday, so we'll prioritize Tuesday and Wednesday.\n3. **Optimization**: We'll aim to find the earliest possible meeting time that satisfies all constraints.\n\nThe solution will be formatted as specified, with the day, start time, and end time.\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define possible days (0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 2)\n\n    # Define start and end times in minutes since 9:00 (540 minutes)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= 540, end_time <= 1020)  # 9:00 to 17:00 in minutes\n    s.add(end_time == start_time + 30)  # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n\n    # Robert's schedule: day, start, end (in minutes since 9:00)\n    robert_busy = [\n        (0, 660, 690),   # Mon 11:00-11:30\n        (0, 840, 870),    # Mon 14:00-14:30\n        (0, 930, 960),    # Mon 15:30-16:00\n        (1, 750, 780),    # Tue 10:30-11:00\n        (1, 900, 930),    # Tue 15:00-15:30\n        (2, 600, 660),    # Wed 10:00-11:00\n        (2, 690, 720),    # Wed 11:30-12:00\n        (2, 750, 780),    # Wed 12:30-13:00\n        (2, 810, 840),    # Wed 13:30-14:00\n        (2, 900, 930),    # Wed 15:00-15:30\n        (2, 960, 990)     # Wed 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n\n    # Ralph's schedule: day, start, end (in minutes since 9:00)\n    ralph_busy = [\n        (0, 600, 870),    # Mon 10:00-13:30\n        (0, 840, 870),    # Mon 14:00-14:30\n        (0, 900, 1020),   # Mon 15:00-17:00\n        (1, 540, 570),    # Tue 9:00-9:30\n        (1, 600, 630),    # Tue 10:00-10:30\n        (1, 660, 690),    # Tue 11:00-11:30\n        (1, 720, 780),    # Tue 12:00-13:00\n        (1, 840, 930),    # Tue 14:00-15:30\n        (1, 960, 1020),   # Tue 16:00-17:00\n        (2, 630, 660),    # Wed 10:30-11:00\n        (2, 690, 720),    # Wed 11:30-12:00\n        (2, 780, 870),    # Wed 13:00-14:30\n        (2, 990, 1020)    # Wed 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Constraint: meeting does not overlap with Robert's busy times\n    for (d, busy_start, busy_end) in robert_busy:\n        s.add(Not(And(day == d, start_time < busy_end, end_time > busy_start)))\n\n    # Constraint: meeting does not overlap with Ralph's busy times\n    for (d, busy_start, busy_end) in ralph_busy:\n        s.add(Not(And(day == d, start_time < busy_end, end_time > busy_start)))\n\n    # Robert prefers to avoid more meetings on Monday (day 0)\n    # We add a soft constraint to prioritize other days\n    # To find the earliest time, we minimize (day * 1440 + start_time)\n    # This ensures earliest day and earliest time on that day\n    objective = day * 1440 + start_time\n    opt = Optimize()\n    opt.add(s.assertions())\n    opt.minimize(objective)\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if opt.check() == sat:\n        m = opt.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = m[end_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert day number to day name\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_name = days[day_val]\n\n        # Convert minutes to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = start_val // 60\n        start_mm = start_val % 60\n        end_hh = end_val // 60\n        end_mm = end_val % 60\n\n        # Format the solution\n        solution = f\"SOLUTION:\\nDay: {day_name}\\nStart Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\\nEnd Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        return solution\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solve_scheduling())\n```"
