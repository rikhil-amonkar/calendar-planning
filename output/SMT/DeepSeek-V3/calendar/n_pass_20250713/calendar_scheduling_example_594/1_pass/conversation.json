You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Adam and Roy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAdam is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nRoy is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver to find the earliest available time slot that fits the constraints of both participants. The approach involves modeling the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem where we need to find a start time such that the meeting duration does not overlap with any of the busy slots of the participants.\n\nHere\u2019s the Python code using Z3:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Define the busy slots for Adam and Roy in minutes since 9:00\n    adam_busy = [\n        (9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60),      # 9:30-10:00\n        (12 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60),      # 12:30-13:00\n        (14 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60),      # 14:30-15:00\n        (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)       # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n    roy_busy = [\n        (10 * 60, 11 * 60),           # 10:00-11:00\n        (11 * 60 + 30, 13 * 60),      # 11:30-13:00\n        (13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60 + 30), # 13:30-14:30\n        (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)       # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Create a Z3 solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # The start time of the meeting (in minutes since 9:00)\n    start = Int('start')\n\n    # Constraints: start time must be within work hours and leave room for the meeting\n    s.add(start >= work_start)\n    s.add(start + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Function to add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with any busy slot\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(busy_slots):\n        for slot in busy_slots:\n            s.add(Or(\n                start + meeting_duration <= slot[0],  # Meeting ends before the busy slot starts\n                start >= slot[1]                     # Meeting starts after the busy slot ends\n            ))\n\n    # Add no-overlap constraints for Adam and Roy\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(adam_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(roy_busy)\n\n    # We want the earliest possible meeting, so we minimize the start time\n    s.minimize(start)\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_time = m[start].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start time from minutes to HH:MM format\n        hours = start_time // 60\n        minutes = start_time % 60\n        start_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_time = start_time + meeting_duration\n        end_hours = end_time // 60\n        end_minutes = end_time % 60\n        end_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Print the solution in the required format\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Work Hours and Meeting Duration**: The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00 (9 AM to 5 PM), and the meeting duration is 30 minutes.\n2. **Busy Slots**: The busy slots for Adam and Roy are converted into minutes since 9:00 for easier arithmetic.\n3. **Z3 Solver**: We use the Z3 solver to find a start time (`start`) that:\n   - Is within work hours.\n   - Does not overlap with any busy slot of Adam or Roy.\n   - Is the earliest possible time (minimized using `s.minimize(start)`).\n4. **Output**: The solution is printed in the required format, converting the start and end times back to HH:MM format.\n\nThe code will output the earliest available 30-minute slot that works for both Adam and Roy."
