You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Margaret and Alexis for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMargaret has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 12:00 to 12:30; \nAlexis has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 14:00 to 16:30; \n\nMargaret do not want to meet on Monday. Tuesday before 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the meeting day, start time, and end time, then adding constraints based on the participants' schedules and preferences. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the meeting day (Monday or Tuesday), start time, and end time.\n2. **Add Constraints**:\n   - The meeting duration must be exactly 30 minutes.\n   - The meeting must occur within working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any blocked times in the participants' schedules.\n   - Margaret prefers not to meet on Monday and prefers times after 14:30 on Tuesday.\n3. **Check Satisfiability**: Use Z3 to check if there's a solution that meets all constraints.\n4. **Extract Solution**: If a solution exists, extract and format the day, start time, and end time.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (0 = 9:00, 30 = 9:30, etc.)\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n    \n    # Constraints for day\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1))  # Monday or Tuesday\n    \n    # Working hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (8 hours = 480 minutes)\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    s.add(start_time >= 0)\n    s.add(end_time == start_time + 30)\n    s.add(end_time <= 480)  # 17:00 is 8 hours after 9:00 (480 minutes)\n    \n    # Margaret's constraints\n    # Margaret does not want to meet on Monday (day == 0)\n    s.add(day != 0)\n    \n    # Margaret's blocked times on Tuesday: 12:00 to 12:30\n    # Convert to minutes from 9:00: 12:00 is 180, 12:30 is 210\n    margaret_tuesday_blocked_start = 180\n    margaret_tuesday_blocked_end = 210\n    s.add(Or(\n        end_time <= margaret_tuesday_blocked_start,\n        start_time >= margaret_tuesday_blocked_end\n    ))\n    \n    # Margaret prefers Tuesday after 14:30 (14:30 is 330 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(start_time >= 330)\n    \n    # Alexis's constraints on Tuesday\n    # Alexis's blocked times on Tuesday:\n    # 9:00-9:30 (0-30), 10:00-10:30 (60-90), 14:00-16:30 (300-450)\n    alexis_tuesday_blocks = [(0, 30), (60, 90), (300, 450)]\n    for block_start, block_end in alexis_tuesday_blocks:\n        s.add(Or(\n            end_time <= block_start,\n            start_time >= block_end\n        ))\n    \n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_min = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert day to string\n        day_str = \"Monday\" if day_val == 0 else \"Tuesday\"\n        \n        # Convert start_min to HH:MM\n        start_hour = 9 + start_min // 60\n        start_min = start_min % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_min:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_min = start_min + 30\n        end_hour = start_hour + end_min // 60\n        end_min = end_min % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_min:02d}\"\n        \n        # Print the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Day Variable**: `day` is an integer where 0 represents Monday and 1 represents Tuesday.\n- **Time Variables**: `start_time` and `end_time` are in minutes from 9:00 AM (e.g., 0 = 9:00, 30 = 9:30).\n- **Constraints**:\n  - The meeting must be on Tuesday (since Margaret doesn't want Monday).\n  - The meeting must not overlap with any blocked times for Margaret or Alexis.\n  - The meeting must be after 14:30 on Tuesday (Margaret's preference).\n- **Solution Extraction**: The model's values are converted back to day names and 24-hour time format for readability.\n\nThis code ensures all constraints are met and outputs the first valid solution found by Z3."
