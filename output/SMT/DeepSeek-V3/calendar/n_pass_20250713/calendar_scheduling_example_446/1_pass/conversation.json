You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Megan, Christine, Gabriel, Sara, Bruce, Kathryn and Billy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMegan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30; \nChristine has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \nGabriel is free the entire day.\nSara has meetings on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nBruce has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \nKathryn is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nBilly has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the meeting start time and ensuring that the chosen time slot doesn't conflict with any participant's busy schedule. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: The meeting start time will be represented as an integer variable in minutes from the start of the workday (9:00 AM).\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The meeting must start and end within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting duration is 30 minutes.\n   - The meeting time must not overlap with any participant's busy slots.\n3. **Solve**: Use Z3 to find a valid start time that satisfies all constraints.\n4. **Output**: Convert the solution back to a readable time format.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (9*60 to 17*60 in minutes)\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Define the start time of the meeting in minutes from 0:00\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Constraint: Meeting must start and end within work hours\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n    \n    # Define each participant's busy slots in minutes\n    busy_slots = {\n        'Megan': [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (10*60, 11*60), (12*60, 12*60 + 30)],\n        'Christine': [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (11*60 + 30, 12*60), (13*60, 14*60), (15*60 + 30, 16*60 + 30)],\n        'Gabriel': [],\n        'Sara': [(11*60 + 30, 12*60), (14*60 + 30, 15*60)],\n        'Bruce': [(9*60 + 30, 10*60), (10*60 + 30, 12*60), (12*60 + 30, 14*60), (14*60 + 30, 15*60), (15*60 + 30, 16*60 + 30)],\n        'Kathryn': [(10*60, 15*60 + 30), (16*60, 16*60 + 30)],\n        'Billy': [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (11*60, 11*60 + 30), (12*60, 14*60), (14*60 + 30, 15*60 + 30)],\n    }\n    \n    # For each participant, add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with their busy slots\n    for person, slots in busy_slots.items():\n        for slot_start, slot_end in slots:\n            # The meeting does not overlap with this slot if:\n            # meeting ends before slot starts OR meeting starts after slot ends\n            s.add(Or(\n                start_time + meeting_duration <= slot_start,\n                start_time >= slot_end\n            ))\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        solution_start = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start time from minutes to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = solution_start // 60\n        start_mm = solution_start % 60\n        end_time = solution_start + meeting_duration\n        end_hh = end_time // 60\n        end_mm = end_time % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found.\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Variables and Constraints**: The `start_time` variable represents the meeting start time in minutes from midnight. Constraints ensure it lies within work hours and doesn't overlap with any busy slots.\n- **Busy Slots**: Each participant's busy slots are converted into minute ranges for easier comparison.\n- **Non-Overlap Constraint**: For each busy slot, the solver ensures the meeting either ends before the slot starts or starts after the slot ends.\n- **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start time is converted back to `HH:MM` format, and the end time is calculated by adding the meeting duration.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds a valid meeting time that accommodates all participants' schedules."
