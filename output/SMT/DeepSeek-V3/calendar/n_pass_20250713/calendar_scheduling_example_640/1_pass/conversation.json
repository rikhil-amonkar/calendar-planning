You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Bobby and Michael for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBobby is busy on Monday during 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nMichael is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining the constraints based on the participants' busy schedules and finding the earliest available time slot that satisfies all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables to represent the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day can be either Monday or Tuesday, and the start and end times should be within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Duration**: The end time should be exactly 30 minutes after the start time.\n   - **Working Hours**: The start and end times must be within 9:00 to 17:00.\n   - **Busy Intervals**: The meeting should not overlap with any of the participants' busy intervals.\n3. **Objective**: Find the earliest possible meeting time. This can be achieved by minimizing the start time, considering both days (Monday is considered earlier than Tuesday).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday\n    start_h = Int('start_h')\n    start_m = Int('start_m')\n    end_h = Int('end_h')\n    end_m = Int('end_m')\n\n    # Constraints for day\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1))\n\n    # Constraints for start and end times (30-minute meeting)\n    s.add(start_h >= 9)\n    s.add(start_h <= 16)  # Since meeting is 30 minutes, latest start is 16:30\n    s.add(start_m >= 0)\n    s.add(start_m < 60)\n    s.add(end_h == start_h)\n    s.add(end_m == start_m + 30)\n    # Handle minute overflow (e.g., 10:30 + 30 minutes is 11:00)\n    s.add(If(start_m + 30 >= 60,\n             And(end_h == start_h + 1, end_m == (start_m + 30) % 60),\n             And(end_h == start_h, end_m == start_m + 30)))\n    s.add(end_h <= 17)\n    s.add(If(end_h == 17, end_m == 0, True))  # End time cannot exceed 17:00\n\n    # Bobby's busy intervals\n    # Monday: 14:30-15:00\n    bobby_monday = [\n        (14, 30, 15, 0)\n    ]\n    # Tuesday: 9:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00\n    bobby_tuesday = [\n        (9, 0, 11, 30),\n        (12, 0, 12, 30),\n        (13, 0, 15, 0),\n        (15, 30, 17, 0)\n    ]\n\n    # Michael's busy intervals\n    # Monday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00\n    michael_monday = [\n        (9, 0, 10, 0),\n        (10, 30, 13, 30),\n        (14, 0, 15, 0),\n        (15, 30, 17, 0)\n    ]\n    # Tuesday: 9:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-14:00, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n    michael_tuesday = [\n        (9, 0, 10, 30),\n        (11, 0, 11, 30),\n        (12, 0, 14, 0),\n        (15, 0, 16, 0),\n        (16, 30, 17, 0)\n    ]\n\n    # Function to check if two intervals overlap\n    def no_overlap(s_h, s_m, e_h, e_m, busy_s_h, busy_s_m, busy_e_h, busy_e_m):\n        # Meeting starts before busy ends and ends after busy starts\n        return Or(\n            e_h < busy_s_h,\n            And(e_h == busy_s_h, e_m <= busy_s_m),\n            s_h > busy_e_h,\n            And(s_h == busy_e_h, s_m >= busy_e_m)\n        )\n\n    # Constraints for Bobby's busy intervals\n    for (bs_h, bs_m, be_h, be_m) in bobby_monday:\n        s.add(If(day == 0,\n                 no_overlap(start_h, start_m, end_h, end_m, bs_h, bs_m, be_h, be_m),\n                 True))\n    for (bs_h, bs_m, be_h, be_m) in bobby_tuesday:\n        s.add(If(day == 1,\n                 no_overlap(start_h, start_m, end_h, end_m, bs_h, bs_m, be_h, be_m),\n                 True))\n\n    # Constraints for Michael's busy intervals\n    for (bs_h, bs_m, be_h, be_m) in michael_monday:\n        s.add(If(day == 0,\n                 no_overlap(start_h, start_m, end_h, end_m, bs_h, bs_m, be_h, be_m),\n                 True))\n    for (bs_h, bs_m, be_h, be_m) in michael_tuesday:\n        s.add(If(day == 1,\n                 no_overlap(start_h, start_m, end_h, end_m, bs_h, bs_m, be_h, be_m),\n                 True))\n\n    # Find the earliest possible time by minimizing (day, start_h, start_m)\n    # We'll use a lexicographic order: day first, then start_h, then start_m\n    opt = Optimize()\n    opt.add(s.assertions())\n    opt.minimize(day * 10000 + start_h * 100 + start_m)\n\n    if opt.check() == sat:\n        model = opt.model()\n        d = model[day].as_long()\n        sh = model[start_h].as_long()\n        sm = model[start_m].as_long()\n        eh = model[end_h].as_long()\n        em = model[end_m].as_long()\n\n        day_str = \"Monday\" if d == 0 else \"Tuesday\"\n        start_time = f\"{sh:02d}:{sm:02d}\"\n        end_time = f\"{eh:02d}:{em:02d}\"\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The variables `day`, `start_h`, `start_m`, `end_h`, and `end_m` are defined to represent the meeting day, start time, and end time. Constraints ensure the meeting duration is 30 minutes and within working hours (9:00-17:00).\n2. **Busy Intervals Handling**: For each participant, their busy intervals are checked to ensure the meeting does not overlap. The `no_overlap` function checks if the meeting time is outside any busy interval.\n3. **Optimization**: The solver minimizes the lexicographic order of day, start hour, and start minute to find the earliest possible meeting time.\n4. **Output**: The solution is printed in the required format, specifying the day, start time, and end time of the meeting.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the available time slots by leveraging Z3's constraint solving capabilities, ensuring the earliest possible meeting time that fits all constraints."
