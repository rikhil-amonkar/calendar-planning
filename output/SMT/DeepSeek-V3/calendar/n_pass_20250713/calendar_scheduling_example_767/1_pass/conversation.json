You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Martha and Beverly for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMartha has blocked their calendar on Monday during 16:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 15:00 to 15:30, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 14:00 to 14:30; \nBeverly has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints that ensure the meeting time doesn't overlap with any blocked times for either participant and fits within the specified work hours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables to represent the day, start time, and duration of the meeting. Since the meeting duration is fixed to one hour, the end time can be derived from the start time.\n2. **Constraints for Each Day**: For each possible day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), we'll check the available time slots by ensuring the meeting doesn't overlap with any blocked periods for Martha or Beverly.\n3. **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must be scheduled between 9:00 and 17:00 on the chosen day.\n4. **Blocked Time Handling**: For each participant, we'll add constraints that the meeting time does not overlap with their blocked times.\n5. **Solve and Extract Solution**: The solver will find a feasible meeting time that satisfies all constraints, and we'll then format the solution as required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_schedule():\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define possible days (0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 2)\n\n    # Define start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes) to 17:00 (1020 minutes)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= 540, start_time + 60 <= 1020)  # Meeting duration is 60 minutes\n\n    # Define the constraints based on the day and participants' blocked times\n    # Martha's blocked times:\n    # Monday: 16:00-17:00 (960-1020)\n    # Tuesday: 15:00-15:30 (900-930)\n    # Wednesday: 10:00-11:00 (600-660), 14:00-14:30 (840-870)\n    # Beverly's blocked times:\n    # Monday: 9:00-13:30 (540-810), 14:00-17:00 (840-1020)\n    # Tuesday: 9:00-17:00 (540-1020)\n    # Wednesday: 9:30-15:30 (570-930), 16:30-17:00 (990-1020)\n\n    # Constraints for each day\n    # We'll use day to be 0, 1, or 2 and add respective constraints\n    # For Monday (day 0)\n    monday_constraints = And(\n        day == 0,\n        # Martha's blocked: 16:00-17:00 (960-1020)\n        Not(And(start_time < 960 + 60, start_time + 60 > 960)),\n        # Beverly's blocked: 9:00-13:30 (540-810), 14:00-17:00 (840-1020)\n        Not(And(start_time < 810, start_time + 60 > 540)),\n        Not(And(start_time < 1020, start_time + 60 > 840))\n    )\n\n    # For Tuesday (day 1)\n    tuesday_constraints = And(\n        day == 1,\n        # Martha's blocked: 15:00-15:30 (900-930)\n        Not(And(start_time < 930, start_time + 60 > 900)),\n        # Beverly's blocked: 9:00-17:00 (540-1020)\n        Not(And(start_time < 1020, start_time + 60 > 540))\n    )\n\n    # For Wednesday (day 2)\n    wednesday_constraints = And(\n        day == 2,\n        # Martha's blocked: 10:00-11:00 (600-660), 14:00-14:30 (840-870)\n        Not(And(start_time < 660, start_time + 60 > 600)),\n        Not(And(start_time < 870, start_time + 60 > 840)),\n        # Beverly's blocked: 9:30-15:30 (570-930), 16:30-17:00 (990-1020)\n        Not(And(start_time < 930, start_time + 60 > 570)),\n        Not(And(start_time < 1020, start_time + 60 > 990))\n    )\n\n    s.add(Or(monday_constraints, tuesday_constraints, wednesday_constraints))\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        day_val = model[day].as_long()\n        start_time_val = model[start_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert start_time_val (minutes from 0:00) to HH:MM\n        hours = start_time_val // 60\n        minutes = start_time_val % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n        end_time_val = start_time_val + 60\n        end_hours = end_time_val // 60\n        end_minutes = end_time_val % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n\n        # Determine the day string\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_str = days[day_val]\n\n        # Print the solution in the required format\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_schedule()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: The variables `day` and `start_time` are defined to represent the meeting day and start time in minutes from midnight. The constraints ensure the meeting fits within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and avoids blocked times for both participants.\n2. **Day-Specific Constraints**: For each day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), specific constraints are added to avoid overlapping with Martha's and Beverly's blocked times. The solver checks these constraints to find a feasible meeting slot.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the day and start time are converted from numerical values to readable strings (e.g., minutes to HH:MM format). The solution is then printed in the specified format.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem using Z3's constraint-solving capabilities to find a meeting time that satisfies all given constraints."
