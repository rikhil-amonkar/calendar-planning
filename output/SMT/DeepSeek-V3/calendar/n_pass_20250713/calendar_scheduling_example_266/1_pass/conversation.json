You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Joe, Keith, Patricia, Nancy and Pamela for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJoe has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00; \nKeith has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nPatricia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 13:30; \nNancy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 16:30; \nPamela has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling each participant's schedule constraints and finding a time slot where all participants are available for the specified duration (30 minutes) within the given work hours (9:00 to 17:00 on Monday).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We will define variables for the start time of the meeting. The start time will be represented in minutes since 9:00 AM to simplify arithmetic operations.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must start and end within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00). This translates to the start time being between 0 and 480 minutes (since 17:00 - 9:00 = 8 hours = 480 minutes), and the end time (start time + 30 minutes) must not exceed 480 minutes.\n   - **Individual Schedules Constraint**: For each participant, the meeting time must not overlap with any of their blocked time slots. This means the meeting must either start and end before a blocked slot or start after a blocked slot ends.\n3. **Check for Solution**: Using the Z3 solver, we will check if there exists a start time that satisfies all constraints. If found, we will convert the start time from minutes back to the HH:MM format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 minutes is 9:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    \n    # Total available minutes from 9:00 to 17:00 is 8 hours = 480 minutes\n    max_time = 480\n    \n    # Constraint: start_time must be >= 0 and <= (max_time - duration)\n    solver.add(start_time >= 0)\n    solver.add(start_time <= max_time - duration)\n    \n    # Define each person's blocked time slots in minutes from 9:00\n    # Each slot is (start, end) in minutes\n    joe_slots = [(30, 60), (90, 120)]  # 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00\n    keith_slots = [(150, 180), (360, 390)]  # 11:30-12:00, 15:00-15:30\n    patricia_slots = [(0, 30), (240, 270)]  # 9:00-9:30, 13:00-13:30\n    nancy_slots = [(0, 120), (150, 450)]  # 9:00-11:00, 11:30-16:30\n    pamela_slots = [(0, 60), (90, 120), (150, 180), (240, 300), (330, 360), (390, 420), (450, 480)]  \n    # 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n    \n    # Combine all blocked slots\n    all_blocked_slots = joe_slots + keith_slots + patricia_slots + nancy_slots + pamela_slots\n    \n    # For each blocked slot, add constraint that the meeting does not overlap\n    for (block_start, block_end) in all_blocked_slots:\n        # The meeting is either entirely before the block or entirely after\n        solver.add(Or(\n            start_time + duration <= block_start,\n            start_time >= block_end\n        ))\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_min = model[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_min back to HH:MM\n        hours = 9 + start_min // 60\n        minutes = start_min % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_min = start_min + duration\n        end_hours = 9 + end_min // 60\n        end_minutes = end_min % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables and Constraints**: The start time of the meeting is represented as an integer variable in minutes from 9:00 AM. The constraints ensure the meeting fits within the workday and does not overlap with any blocked time slots of the participants.\n3. **Blocked Slots Handling**: For each participant, their blocked time slots are converted into minutes from 9:00 AM. The solver ensures the meeting time does not overlap with any of these slots by requiring the meeting to be entirely before or after each blocked slot.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start time in minutes is converted back to HH:MM format. The solution is printed in the required format, specifying the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the available time slots by systematically applying constraints and leveraging the Z3 solver to find a feasible meeting time."
