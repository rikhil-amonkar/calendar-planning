You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ryan and Adam for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nRyan has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 12:00 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nAdam is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nRyan can not meet on Wednesday. Adam would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:30. Tuesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints that must be satisfied, such as the meeting duration, the participants' availability, and their preferences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We will define variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day will be an integer representing Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. The start and end times will be integers representing minutes from the start of the workday (9:00 AM).\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - **Day Constraints**: The meeting must occur on one of the specified days (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday), but Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday, and Adam prefers to avoid Monday before 14:30.\n   - **Time Constraints**: The meeting must last 30 minutes and must fit within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - **Availability Constraints**: The meeting time must not overlap with any of the participants' existing meetings.\n3. **Solve**: Using the Z3 solver, we check for a solution that satisfies all constraints. If found, we convert the solution back to a readable format (day name, start time, and end time).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 9:30 is 30)\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n\n    # Possible days: Monday (0), Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2)\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1, day == 2))\n    \n    # Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday (day 2)\n    s.add(day != 2)\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    s.add(end_time == start_time + 30)\n    \n    # Meeting must be within work hours (9:00 to 17:00, so 0 to 480 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(start_time >= 0)\n    s.add(end_time <= 480)  # 17:00 is 8 hours after 9:00 (8*60=480)\n    \n    # Ryan's busy slots (converted to minutes from 9:00)\n    ryan_busy = {\n        0: [(30, 60), (120, 180), (240, 270), (390, 420)],  # Monday\n        1: [(150, 210), (390, 420)],  # Tuesday\n        2: [(180, 240), (390, 420), (450, 480)]  # Wednesday (but excluded)\n    }\n    \n    # Adam's busy slots (converted to minutes from 9:00)\n    adam_busy = {\n        0: [(0, 90), (120, 270), (300, 420), (450, 480)],  # Monday\n        1: [(0, 60), (90, 390), (420, 480)],  # Tuesday\n        2: [(0, 30), (60, 120), (150, 330), (360, 390), (420, 450)]  # Wednesday\n    }\n    \n    # Adam prefers to avoid Monday before 14:30 (14:30 is 5.5 hours after 9:00, 5.5*60=330 minutes)\n    # So if day is Monday, start_time should be >= 330 (14:30)\n    s.add(Implies(day == 0, start_time >= 330))\n    \n    # Function to add no-overlap constraints\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(busy_slots, day_var, start, end):\n        for d in busy_slots:\n            slots = busy_slots[d]\n            for slot in slots:\n                s.add(Not(And(day_var == d,\n                              Not(Or(end <= slot[0], start >= slot[1]))))\n    \n    # Add constraints for Ryan and Adam\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(ryan_busy, day, start_time, end_time)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(adam_busy, day, start_time, end_time)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        day_val = model[day].as_long()\n        start_val = model[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = model[end_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert day to string\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_str = days[day_val]\n        \n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = 9 + start_val // 60\n        start_mm = start_val % 60\n        end_hh = 9 + end_val // 60\n        end_mm = end_val % 60\n        \n        # Format as two-digit strings\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        \n        # Print the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: The variables `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are defined to represent the meeting day and times. Constraints are added to ensure the meeting is on a valid day, lasts 30 minutes, and fits within work hours.\n2. **Busy Slots Handling**: The participants' busy slots are converted into minutes from 9:00 AM. Constraints ensure the meeting does not overlap with any busy slots.\n3. **Preferences Handling**: Adam's preference to avoid Monday before 14:30 is handled by adding a constraint that if the day is Monday, the meeting must start at or after 14:30.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the model values are converted back to day names and 24-hour time format for readability.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring all constraints and preferences are met."
