You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Julie, Sean and Lori for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJulie has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \nSean has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nLori is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we can use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the start time of the meeting and ensuring that the meeting does not overlap with any of the participants' busy times. Here's the Python code that implements this solution:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Define the work hours (9:00 to 17:00)\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the start time variable (in minutes from 0:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n\n    # Constraint: start time must be within work hours and the meeting must end before work ends\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Define the busy intervals for each participant in minutes\n    julie_busy = [\n        (9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30),    # 9:00-9:30\n        (11 * 60, 11 * 60 + 30),   # 11:00-11:30\n        (12 * 60, 12 * 60 + 30),   # 12:00-12:30\n        (13 * 60 + 30, 14 * 60),   # 13:30-14:00\n        (16 * 60, 17 * 60)         # 16:00-17:00\n    ]\n    sean_busy = [\n        (9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30),    # 9:00-9:30\n        (13 * 60, 13 * 60 + 30),   # 13:00-13:30\n        (15 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30),   # 15:00-15:30\n        (16 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)    # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n    lori_busy = [\n        (10 * 60, 10 * 60 + 30),   # 10:00-10:30\n        (11 * 60, 13 * 60),        # 11:00-13:00\n        (15 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)    # 15:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Function to check if the meeting overlaps with any busy interval\n    def no_overlap(start, busy_intervals):\n        return And([Or(start + meeting_duration <= busy_start, start >= busy_end) \n                    for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_intervals])\n\n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    s.add(no_overlap(start_time, julie_busy))\n    s.add(no_overlap(start_time, sean_busy))\n    s.add(no_overlap(start_time, lori_busy))\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_minutes = m[start_time].as_long()\n        start_hour = start_minutes // 60\n        start_minute = start_minutes % 60\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n\n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Work Hours and Meeting Duration**: The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00, and the meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes).\n2. **Z3 Solver Setup**: We create a Z3 solver instance and define an integer variable `start_time` representing the meeting's start time in minutes from midnight.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start and end within work hours.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of the participants' busy intervals. The `no_overlap` function ensures this by checking that the meeting either ends before a busy interval starts or starts after it ends.\n4. **Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are defined in minutes for easy comparison.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start and end times are converted back to hours and minutes and printed in the required format.\n\nThis code will output the first valid time slot that satisfies all constraints. For the given problem, the solution is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION:\nDay: Monday\nStart Time: 14:00\nEnd Time: 15:00\n```"
