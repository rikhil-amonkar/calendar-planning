You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michael, Eric and Arthur for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMichael has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nEric's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nArthur has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a time slot that fits all participants' schedules. The approach involves encoding the constraints based on each participant's busy times and finding a 30-minute window where all are available between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday.\n\nHere's the Python code using Z3:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the work hours (9:00 to 17:00)\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60    # 17:00 in minutes\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n\n    # Define the start time of the meeting as a Z3 variable\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    end_time = start_time + meeting_duration\n\n    # Constraint: meeting must be within work hours\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(end_time <= work_end)\n\n    # Michael's busy times (in minutes since 9:00)\n    michael_busy = [\n        (9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60 + 30),  # 9:30-10:30\n        (15 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30),       # 15:00-15:30\n        (16 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)        # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n\n    # Arthur's busy times (in minutes since 9:00)\n    arthur_busy = [\n        (9 * 60, 12 * 60),            # 9:00-12:00\n        (13 * 60, 15 * 60),            # 13:00-15:00\n        (15 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60),       # 15:30-16:00\n        (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)        # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Eric is free all day, so no constraints for him\n\n    # Add constraints for Michael: meeting must not overlap with his busy times\n    for busy_start, busy_end in michael_busy:\n        s.add(Or(\n            end_time <= busy_start,\n            start_time >= busy_end\n        ))\n\n    # Add constraints for Arthur: meeting must not overlap with his busy times\n    for busy_start, busy_end in arthur_busy:\n        s.add(Or(\n            end_time <= busy_start,\n            start_time >= busy_end\n        ))\n\n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start = m[start_time].as_long()\n        # Convert start time from minutes to HH:MM format\n        hours = start // 60\n        minutes = start % 60\n        start_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        # Calculate end time\n        end = start + meeting_duration\n        hours_end = end // 60\n        minutes_end = end % 60\n        end_str = f\"{hours_end:02d}:{minutes_end:02d}\"\n        # Print the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Z3 Solver Setup**: We initialize the Z3 solver and define the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).\n2. **Variables**: `start_time` is an integer variable representing the meeting start time in minutes since 9:00.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must fit within work hours.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of Michael's or Arthur's busy times.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, we convert the start and end times from minutes to `HH:MM` format and print the result.\n\nThe output will be the first available 30-minute slot where all participants are free. In this case, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION:\nDay: Monday\nStart Time: 12:00\nEnd Time: 12:30\n```"
