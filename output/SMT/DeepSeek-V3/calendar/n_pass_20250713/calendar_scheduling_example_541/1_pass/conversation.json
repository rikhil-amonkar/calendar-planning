        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining the available time slots for each participant and finding a one-hour window where both participants are free between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Time Slots**: Convert the given time slots into a list of busy intervals for each participant. Each interval is represented as a tuple of start and end times in minutes since 9:00 (e.g., 9:00 is 0 minutes, 10:00 is 60 minutes, etc.).\n2. **Check for Available Slots**: For each possible one-hour window (60 minutes) between 9:00 (0 minutes) and 17:00 (480 minutes), check if the window does not overlap with any busy interval for either participant.\n3. **Find the Earliest Valid Slot**: Iterate through the possible slots in chronological order and return the first valid one-hour window that fits both participants' schedules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes from 9:00 (0) to 17:00 (480)\n    work_start = 0  # 9:00 in minutes from 9:00\n    work_end = 480   # 17:00 in minutes from 9:00\n    meeting_duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    # Define the busy intervals for each participant in minutes from 9:00\n    kayla_busy = [\n        (60, 90),    # 10:00-10:30\n        (330, 420)   # 14:30-16:00\n    ]\n    rebecca_busy = [\n        (0, 240),     # 9:00-13:00\n        (270, 360),   # 13:30-15:00\n        (390, 420)    # 15:30-16:00\n    ]\n\n    # Create a Z3 solver instance\n    solver = Solver()\n\n    # The meeting start time (in minutes from 9:00)\n    start = Int('start')\n\n    # Constraints: start must be within work hours and allow for the meeting duration\n    solver.add(start >= work_start)\n    solver.add(start + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # The meeting must not overlap with any of Kayla's busy intervals\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in kayla_busy:\n        solver.add(Or(start >= busy_end, start + meeting_duration <= busy_start))\n\n    # The meeting must not overlap with any of Rebecca's busy intervals\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in rebecca_busy:\n        solver.add(Or(start >= busy_end, start + meeting_duration <= busy_start))\n\n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model[start].as_long()\n\n        # Convert start_minutes back to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        start_minute = start_minutes % 60\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n\n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The code converts all time slots into minutes from 9:00 AM to simplify arithmetic operations. For example, 10:00 AM is represented as 60 minutes (60 minutes past 9:00 AM).\n2. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The Z3 solver is initialized to find a meeting start time (`start`) that adheres to the constraints:\n   - The meeting must start within working hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM).\n   - The meeting duration must fit within the remaining time before 5:00 PM.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of the busy intervals for either participant.\n3. **Constraint Handling**: For each participant's busy intervals, constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap. The solver checks for a valid start time that meets all constraints.\n4. **Output Conversion**: If a solution is found, the start time in minutes is converted back to a 24-hour format for readability. The solution is printed in the specified format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint satisfaction, ensuring the solution meets all given constraints."
