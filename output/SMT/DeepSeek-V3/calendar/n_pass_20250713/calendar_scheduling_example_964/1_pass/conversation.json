You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Betty and Megan for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBetty is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Friday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nMegan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30, Friday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nBetty can not meet on Wednesday. Thursday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the constraints of each participant's schedule and finding a time slot that satisfies all conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables for the day, start time, and duration of the meeting. The day will be an integer representing Monday to Friday (0 to 4), and the start time will be an integer representing minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes, since 9:00 AM is 9*60 = 540 minutes).\n2. **Constraints on Day and Time**: The meeting must be scheduled between 9:00 and 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes) on a valid day (initially Monday to Friday, but then excluding Wednesday and Thursday for Betty).\n3. **Duration Constraint**: The meeting duration is one hour (60 minutes), so the end time must be start time + 60 minutes.\n4. **Participants' Busy Slots**: For each participant, we need to ensure the meeting does not overlap with their busy times. This involves checking that the meeting time does not fall within any of the busy intervals for both Betty and Megan.\n5. **Z3 Solver**: We use the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies all these constraints. If a solution exists, it will provide the day and start time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Days: Monday=0, Tuesday=1, Wednesday=2, Thursday=3, Friday=4\n    day = Int('day')\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 0:00\n\n    # Constraints for day: must be 0 (Monday), 1 (Tuesday), or 4 (Friday) because Betty can't meet on Wednesday (2) or Thursday (3)\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1, day == 4))\n\n    # Meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes)\n    duration = 60\n    end_time = start_time + duration\n\n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540)\n    s.add(end_time <= 1020)\n\n    # Betty's busy times for each day\n    betty_busy = {\n        0: [(600, 630), (690, 750), (960, 990)],  # Monday 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:30, 16:00-16:30\n        1: [(570, 600), (630, 660), (720, 750), (810, 900), (990, 1020)],  # Tuesday 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00\n        4: [(540, 600), (690, 720), (750, 780), (870, 900)]  # Friday 9:00-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:00\n    }\n\n    # Megan's busy times for each day\n    megan_busy = {\n        0: [(540, 1020)],  # Monday all day\n        1: [(540, 570), (600, 630), (720, 840), (900, 930), (960, 990)],  # Tuesday 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 12:00-14:00, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n        2: [(570, 630), (660, 690), (750, 780), (810, 870), (930, 1020)],  # Wednesday 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00\n        3: [(540, 630), (690, 840), (870, 900), (930, 990)],  # Thursday 9:00-10:30, 11:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:30\n        4: [(540, 1020)]  # Friday all day\n    }\n\n    # For the selected day, the meeting must not overlap with any busy slots for Betty and Megan\n    def no_overlap(busy_slots, s_time, e_time):\n        constraints = []\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_slots:\n            # The meeting does not overlap with this busy slot if it's entirely before or after\n            constraints.append(Or(e_time <= busy_start, s_time >= busy_end))\n        return And(constraints)\n\n    # Constraints for Betty\n    betty_constraints = []\n    for d in betty_busy:\n        betty_constraints.append(And(day == d, no_overlap(betty_busy[d], start_time, end_time)))\n    s.add(Or(betty_constraints))\n\n    # Constraints for Megan\n    megan_constraints = []\n    for d in megan_busy:\n        megan_constraints.append(And(day == d, no_overlap(megan_busy[d], start_time, end_time)))\n    s.add(Or(megan_constraints))\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        d = model[day].as_long()\n        st = model[start_time].as_long()\n        et = st + duration\n\n        # Convert day number to day name\n        day_names = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']\n        day_name = day_names[d]\n\n        # Convert start and end times from minutes to HH:MM format\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            hh = minutes // 60\n            mm = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{hh:02d}:{mm:02d}\"\n\n        start_str = minutes_to_time(st)\n        end_str = minutes_to_time(et)\n\n        print(f\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Day and Time Variables**: The variables `day` and `start_time` are defined to represent the meeting day and start time in minutes from midnight.\n2. **Constraints on Day and Time**: The meeting must be on Monday, Tuesday, or Friday (as Betty cannot meet on Wednesday or Thursday). The start time must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00), and the duration is fixed at 60 minutes.\n3. **Busy Slots Handling**: For each participant, their busy slots are converted into constraints ensuring the meeting does not overlap. For each day, the solver checks that the meeting time does not fall within any busy interval.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the day and start time are converted from numerical representations to readable strings (e.g., 0 becomes \"Monday\", 570 minutes becomes \"09:30\").\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving, ensuring all participants' schedules and preferences are respected."
