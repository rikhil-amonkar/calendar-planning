You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Eugene and Eric for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nEugene is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:30, Friday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30; \nEric is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 17:00, Friday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00; \n\nEric would like to avoid more meetings on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the constraints of each participant's schedule and finding a time slot that satisfies all conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables to represent the day, start time, and duration of the meeting. The day will be an integer representing the days of the week (Monday to Friday). The start time will be an integer representing minutes from 9:00 AM (540 minutes, since 9:00 AM is 9*60 = 540 minutes into the day).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Day Constraint**: The meeting must occur on one of the specified days (Monday to Friday).\n   - **Time Constraints**: The meeting must start between 9:00 AM and 17:00 PM (5:00 PM), and the duration is 30 minutes. The end time must not exceed 17:00 PM.\n   - **Busy Slots**: For each participant, the meeting must not overlap with their busy times. This involves checking that the meeting time does not fall within any of the busy intervals for both participants on the chosen day.\n   - **Preference Constraint**: Eric prefers to avoid more meetings on Wednesday, so we add a constraint to avoid Wednesday if possible.\n3. **Solve**: Use Z3 to find a solution that satisfies all constraints. If a solution exists, it will provide the day, start time, and end time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Days: Monday=0, Tuesday=1, Wednesday=2, Thursday=3, Friday=4\n    day = Int('day')\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes since 00:00\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    end_time = start_time + duration\n\n    # Constraints for day: must be between 0 (Monday) and 4 (Friday)\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 4)\n\n    # Work hours are 9:00 (540) to 17:00 (1020)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540)\n    s.add(end_time <= 1020)\n\n    # Eugene's busy times per day\n    eugene_busy = {\n        0: [(660, 720), (810, 840), (870, 900), (960, 990)],  # Monday 11:00-12:00, etc.\n        2: [(540, 570), (660, 690), (720, 750), (810, 900)],  # Wednesday\n        3: [(570, 600), (660, 750)],  # Thursday\n        4: [(630, 660), (720, 750), (780, 810)]  # Friday\n    }\n\n    # Eric's busy times per day\n    eric_busy = {\n        0: [(540, 1020)],  # Monday all day\n        1: [(540, 1020)],  # Tuesday all day\n        2: [(540, 690), (720, 840), (870, 990)],  # Wednesday\n        3: [(540, 1020)],  # Thursday all day\n        4: [(540, 660), (690, 1020)]  # Friday\n    }\n\n    # Function to add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with any busy slots for a person on the selected day\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(busy_slots_dict, person_day):\n        constraints = []\n        for d in busy_slots_dict:\n            slots = busy_slots_dict[d]\n            for (busy_start, busy_end) in slots:\n                # If the current day is d, then the meeting must not overlap with any busy slot\n                constraint = Not(And(day == d,\n                                    Or(\n                                        And(start_time >= busy_start, start_time < busy_end),\n                                        And(end_time > busy_start, end_time <= busy_end),\n                                        And(start_time <= busy_start, end_time >= busy_end)\n                                    )))\n                constraints.append(constraint)\n        return constraints\n\n    # Add no-overlap constraints for Eugene and Eric\n    s.add(add_no_overlap_constraints(eugene_busy, day))\n    s.add(add_no_overlap_constraints(eric_busy, day))\n\n    # Eric prefers to avoid Wednesday, so try other days first by adding a soft constraint\n    # We first try to find a solution where day is not Wednesday (2)\n    # If that's not possible, we relax the constraint\n    temp_solver = Solver()\n    temp_solver.add(s.assertions())\n    temp_solver.add(day != 2)\n    if temp_solver.check() == sat:\n        s.add(day != 2)\n    # else, proceed without this constraint\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = start_val + duration\n\n        # Convert day_val to day name\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n        day_name = days[day_val]\n\n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            h = minutes // 60\n            m = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n\n        start_str = minutes_to_time(start_val)\n        end_str = minutes_to_time(end_val)\n\n        print(f\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: The variables `day` and `start_time` are defined, with constraints ensuring the meeting fits within work hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM) and lasts 30 minutes.\n2. **Busy Slots Handling**: The busy times for Eugene and Eric are encoded as dictionaries where each key is a day (0 to 4) and the value is a list of tuples representing busy intervals in minutes from midnight.\n3. **No-Overlap Constraints**: For each participant, constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap with any of their busy intervals on the selected day.\n4. **Preference Handling**: A soft constraint is added to avoid Wednesday if possible. The solver first checks if a solution exists without Wednesday; if not, it proceeds to include Wednesday.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the day, start time, and end time are converted from numerical values to readable strings and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring all constraints and preferences are respected."
