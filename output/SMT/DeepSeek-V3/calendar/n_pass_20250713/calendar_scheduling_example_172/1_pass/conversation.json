You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Patrick, Kayla, Carl and Christian for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nPatrick is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nKayla is busy on Monday during 12:30 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nCarl has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 17:00; \nChristian has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a time slot that fits all participants' schedules. The approach involves encoding each participant's busy times and then finding a 30-minute slot where none of them are busy. Here's the Python code using Z3:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60    # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # The meeting start time (in minutes since 9:00)\n    meeting_start = Int('meeting_start')\n    s.add(meeting_start >= work_start)\n    s.add(meeting_start + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Each person's busy intervals in minutes since 9:00\n    patrick_busy = [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (10*60, 10*60 + 30), (13*60 + 30, 14*60), (16*60, 16*60 + 30)]\n    kayla_busy = [(12*60 + 30, 13*60 + 30), (15*60, 15*60 + 30), (16*60, 16*60 + 30)]\n    carl_busy = [(10*60 + 30, 11*60), (12*60, 12*60 + 30), (13*60, 13*60 + 30), (14*60 + 30, 17*60)]\n    christian_busy = [(9*60, 12*60 + 30), (13*60, 14*60), (14*60 + 30, 17*60)]\n\n    # Function to check if the meeting overlaps with any busy interval\n    def no_overlap(start, duration, busy_intervals):\n        constraints = []\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_intervals:\n            constraints.append(Or(start + duration <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n        return And(*constraints)\n\n    # Add constraints for each person\n    s.add(no_overlap(meeting_start, meeting_duration, patrick_busy))\n    s.add(no_overlap(meeting_start, meeting_duration, kayla_busy))\n    s.add(no_overlap(meeting_start, meeting_duration, carl_busy))\n    s.add(no_overlap(meeting_start, meeting_duration, christian_busy))\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_min = m[meeting_start].as_long()\n        start_hour = start_min // 60\n        start_minute = start_min % 60\n        end_min = start_min + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = end_min // 60\n        end_minute = end_min % 60\n\n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Work Hours and Meeting Duration**: The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00 (9 AM to 5 PM), and the meeting duration is 30 minutes.\n2. **Z3 Solver Setup**: We use the Z3 solver to find a meeting start time (`meeting_start`) that fits within the work hours.\n3. **Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are converted into minutes since 9:00 for easier arithmetic.\n4. **No Overlap Constraint**: The `no_overlap` function ensures the meeting does not overlap with any of the busy intervals for each participant. This is done by asserting that the meeting either ends before a busy interval starts or starts after it ends.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the start and end times are converted back to the HH:MM format and printed.\n\nThe output will be the first available 30-minute slot where all participants are free. In this case, the solution is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION:\nDay: Monday\nStart Time: 14:00\nEnd Time: 14:30\n```"
