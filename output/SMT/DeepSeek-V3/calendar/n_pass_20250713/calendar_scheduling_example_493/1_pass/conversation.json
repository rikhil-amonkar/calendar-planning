You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Tyler, Kelly, Stephanie, Hannah, Joe, Diana and Deborah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nTyler is free the entire day.\nKellyhas no meetings the whole day.\nStephanie has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nHannahhas no meetings the whole day.\nJoe has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 17:00; \nDiana has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nDeborah is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the start time of the meeting and ensuring that the chosen time slot does not conflict with any of the participants' blocked times. The meeting duration is fixed at 30 minutes, and it must fall within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert all time slots (both blocked and available) into minutes since 9:00 AM (the start of the workday) to simplify arithmetic operations. For example, 9:00 AM is 0 minutes, 10:00 AM is 60 minutes, etc.\n2. **Define Constraints**: For each participant, ensure that the meeting's start time does not overlap with their blocked intervals. The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so the end time is start time + 30 minutes.\n3. **Check for Valid Slots**: The solver will find a start time (in minutes) such that the interval [start, start + 30] does not intersect with any blocked intervals of any participant, and the entire meeting fits within the 9:00 to 17:00 window (0 to 480 minutes).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (9 AM to 5 PM), which is 8 hours or 480 minutes\n    total_minutes = 480  # from 9:00 (0) to 17:00 (480)\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # The start time of the meeting in minutes from 9:00 AM\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Constraints: start_time must be >= 0 and <= total_minutes - meeting_duration\n    s.add(start_time >= 0)\n    s.add(start_time <= total_minutes - meeting_duration)\n    \n    # Define each participant's blocked times in minutes from 9:00 AM\n    # Stephanie: 11:00-11:30 (120-150), 14:30-15:00 (330-360)\n    stephanie_blocked = [(120, 150), (330, 360)]\n    # Joe: 9:00-9:30 (0-30), 10:00-12:00 (60-180), 12:30-13:00 (210-240), 14:00-17:00 (300-480)\n    joe_blocked = [(0, 30), (60, 180), (210, 240), (300, 480)]\n    # Diana: 9:00-10:30 (0-90), 11:30-12:00 (150-180), 13:00-14:00 (240-300), 14:30-15:30 (330-390), 16:00-17:00 (420-480)\n    diana_blocked = [(0, 90), (150, 180), (240, 300), (330, 390), (420, 480)]\n    # Deborah: 9:00-10:00 (0-60), 10:30-12:00 (90-180), 12:30-13:00 (210-240), 13:30-14:00 (270-300), 14:30-15:30 (330-390), 16:00-16:30 (420-450)\n    deborah_blocked = [(0, 60), (90, 180), (210, 240), (270, 300), (330, 390), (420, 450)]\n    \n    # For each participant, add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with their blocked times\n    # Tyler and Kelly and Hannah have no meetings, so no constraints\n    \n    # Stephanie's constraints\n    for (block_start, block_end) in stephanie_blocked:\n        s.add(Or(start_time >= block_end, start_time + meeting_duration <= block_start))\n    \n    # Joe's constraints\n    for (block_start, block_end) in joe_blocked:\n        s.add(Or(start_time >= block_end, start_time + meeting_duration <= block_start))\n    \n    # Diana's constraints\n    for (block_start, block_end) in diana_blocked:\n        s.add(Or(start_time >= block_end, start_time + meeting_duration <= block_start))\n    \n    # Deborah's constraints\n    for (block_start, block_end) in deborah_blocked:\n        s.add(Or(start_time >= block_end, start_time + meeting_duration <= block_start))\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_min = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_min back to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = 9 + start_min // 60\n        start_mm = start_min % 60\n        end_min = start_min + meeting_duration\n        end_hh = 9 + end_min // 60\n        end_mm = end_min % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables and Constraints**: The start time of the meeting is represented as an integer variable in minutes from 9:00 AM. The constraints ensure the meeting fits within the workday and does not overlap with any blocked times of the participants.\n3. **Blocked Times Handling**: For each participant, their blocked times are converted into minute intervals relative to 9:00 AM. The solver checks that the meeting's interval does not overlap with any of these blocked intervals.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a valid start time is found, it is converted back to a 24-hour format for readability. The solution is printed in the specified format, showing the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint programming, ensuring the solution adheres to all given constraints."
