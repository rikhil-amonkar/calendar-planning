You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Katherine, Rebecca, Julie, Angela, Nicholas and Carl for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKatherine is busy on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30; \nRebeccahas no meetings the whole day.\nJulie is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nAngela has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nNicholas has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nCarl has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nAngela would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

Constraints are added to ensure the meeting fits within work hours and does not overlap with any participant's busy times.\n3. **Busy Times Encoding**: Each participant's busy times are encoded as intervals where the meeting cannot overlap. For example, Katherine is busy from 12:00-12:30 and 13:00-14:30, so the meeting cannot overlap with these intervals.\n4. **Angela's Preference**: Angela prefers no meetings before 15:00, so we add a constraint that the meeting must end after 15:00 (i.e., `start_time + meeting_duration > 15 * 60`).\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start and end times are converted from minutes to HH:MM format and printed.\n\nThe output will be the earliest valid time slot that satisfies all constraints. For the given problem, the solution is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION:\nDay: Monday\nStart Time: 16:00\nEnd Time: 16:30\n```"
