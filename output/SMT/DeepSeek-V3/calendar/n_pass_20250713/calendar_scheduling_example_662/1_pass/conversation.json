You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Gary and David for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nGary has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 14:30 to 16:00; \nDavid has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a feasible meeting time that fits within the given constraints. The approach involves encoding the availability of both participants and then finding a one-hour slot where both are free on either Monday or Tuesday between 9:00 and 17:00.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the day, start time, and duration of the meeting. The day will be either Monday or Tuesday, and the start time will be within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n2. **Encode Constraints**: For each participant, we'll encode their blocked times as constraints. The meeting must not overlap with any of these blocked times.\n3. **Check Availability**: The solver will check for a start time such that the one-hour meeting duration does not conflict with any blocked times for either participant on the chosen day.\n4. **Extract Solution**: Once a feasible solution is found, we'll extract and format the day, start time, and end time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_scheduling():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define possible days (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1))\n\n    # Define start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes) to 17:00 (1020 minutes)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= 540)  # 9:00 in minutes\n    s.add(start_time + 60 <= 1020)  # Meeting ends by 17:00 (60 minutes duration)\n\n    # Gary's blocked times\n    gary_monday_blocked = [\n        (570, 600),   # 9:30-10:00\n        (660, 780),    # 11:00-13:00\n        (840, 870),     # 14:00-14:30\n        (990, 1020)     # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n    gary_tuesday_blocked = [\n        (540, 570),     # 9:00-9:30\n        (630, 660),     # 10:30-11:00\n        (870, 960)      # 14:30-16:00\n    ]\n\n    # David's blocked times\n    david_monday_blocked = [\n        (540, 570),     # 9:00-9:30\n        (600, 780),     # 10:00-13:00\n        (870, 990)      # 14:30-16:30\n    ]\n    david_tuesday_blocked = [\n        (540, 570),     # 9:00-9:30\n        (600, 630),     # 10:00-10:30\n        (660, 750),     # 11:00-12:30\n        (780, 870),     # 13:00-14:30\n        (900, 960),     # 15:00-16:00\n        (990, 1020)     # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Function to add constraints for not overlapping with blocked times\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(day_var, start, duration, blocked_times_day0, blocked_times_day1):\n        constraints = []\n        # For each blocked time in day 0 (Monday)\n        for (block_start, block_end) in blocked_times_day0:\n            constraints.append(Or(\n                day_var != 0,\n                start >= block_end,\n                start + duration <= block_start\n            ))\n        # For each blocked time in day 1 (Tuesday)\n        for (block_start, block_end) in blocked_times_day1:\n            constraints.append(Or(\n                day_var != 1,\n                start >= block_end,\n                start + duration <= block_start\n            ))\n        return constraints\n\n    # Add constraints for Gary\n    gary_constraints = add_no_overlap_constraints(day, start_time, 60, gary_monday_blocked, gary_tuesday_blocked)\n    for c in gary_constraints:\n        s.add(c)\n\n    # Add constraints for David\n    david_constraints = add_no_overlap_constraints(day, start_time, 60, david_monday_blocked, david_tuesday_blocked)\n    for c in david_constraints:\n        s.add(c)\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n\n        # Determine day name\n        day_name = \"Monday\" if day_val == 0 else \"Tuesday\"\n\n        # Convert start time from minutes to HH:MM\n        start_hh = start_val // 60\n        start_mm = start_val % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\"\n\n        # Calculate end time\n        end_val = start_val + 60\n        end_hh = end_val // 60\n        end_mm = end_val % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n\n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The variables `day` (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday) and `start_time` (in minutes from midnight) are defined. The solver ensures the meeting fits within 9:00 to 17:00 and lasts one hour.\n2. **Blocked Times**: Each participant's blocked times are encoded as intervals. The solver checks that the meeting does not overlap with any blocked intervals for either participant on the selected day.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the model is queried for the day and start time. The start and end times are converted from minutes to a readable HH:MM format, and the solution is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging the Z3 solver's ability to handle logical constraints, ensuring the solution meets all given scheduling constraints."
