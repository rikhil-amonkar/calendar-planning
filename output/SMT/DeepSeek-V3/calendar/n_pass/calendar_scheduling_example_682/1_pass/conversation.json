You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amanda and Nathan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nAmanda is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nNathan is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nAmanda do not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00. Nathan can not meet on Monday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints that must be satisfied to find a valid meeting time. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be 30 minutes long.\n   - The meeting must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of Amanda's or Nathan's busy times.\n   - Amanda does not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00.\n   - Nathan cannot meet on Monday.\n3. **Solve**: Use the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.\n4. **Output**: Format the solution as specified.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the possible days (Monday=0, Tuesday=1)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1))\n\n    # Define the start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= 540)  # 9:00\n    s.add(start_time <= 1020) # 17:00 - 30 minutes (since meeting is 30 mins)\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    end_time = start_time + 30\n    s.add(end_time <= 1020)  # Ensure end time is within 17:00\n\n    # Amanda's busy times (converted to minutes from 0:00)\n    amanda_busy = [\n        # Monday\n        [(540, 630), (660, 690), (750, 780), (810, 840), (870, 900), (960, 990)],\n        # Tuesday\n        [(540, 570), (600, 630), (690, 720), (810, 870), (930, 960), (990, 1020)]\n    ]\n\n    # Nathan's busy times (converted to minutes from 0:00)\n    nathan_busy = [\n        # Monday\n        [(600, 630), (660, 690), (810, 870), (960, 990)],\n        # Tuesday\n        [(540, 630), (660, 780), (810, 840), (870, 930), (960, 990)]\n    ]\n\n    # Add constraints for Amanda's busy times\n    for day_idx in range(2):\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in amanda_busy[day_idx]:\n            s.add(Not(And(day == day_idx,\n                          start_time < busy_end,\n                          end_time > busy_start)))\n\n    # Add constraints for Nathan's busy times\n    for day_idx in range(2):\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in nathan_busy[day_idx]:\n            s.add(Not(And(day == day_idx,\n                          start_time < busy_end,\n                          end_time > busy_start)))\n\n    # Amanda does not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00 (660 minutes)\n    s.add(Not(And(day == 1, start_time >= 660)))\n\n    # Nathan cannot meet on Monday\n    s.add(day != 0)\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = start_val + 30\n\n        # Convert day to string\n        day_str = \"Monday\" if day_val == 0 else \"Tuesday\"\n\n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = start_val // 60\n        start_mm = start_val % 60\n        end_hh = end_val // 60\n        end_mm = end_val % 60\n\n        # Format the output\n        solution = f\"SOLUTION:\\nDay: {day_str}\\nStart Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\\nEnd Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        print(solution)\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Variables**:\n   - `day`: Represents the day of the meeting (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday).\n   - `start_time`: The start time of the meeting in minutes from midnight.\n   - `end_time`: The end time of the meeting, which is `start_time + 30`.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be within 9:00 to 17:00.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any busy times for Amanda or Nathan.\n   - Amanda's preference to not meet on Tuesday after 11:00 is enforced by ensuring the start time on Tuesday is before 11:00 (660 minutes).\n   - Nathan's unavailability on Monday is enforced by setting `day != 0`.\n\n3. **Solution Extraction**:\n   - If a solution is found, the day and times are converted to the required format and printed.\n\nThis code will output the first valid meeting time that satisfies all constraints. For the given problem, the solution is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION:\nDay: Tuesday\nStart Time: 10:30\nEnd Time: 11:00\n```"
