You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jesse and Lawrence for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJesse has meetings on Monday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00; \nLawrence is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \n\nLawrence can not meet on Tuesday after 16:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting, and then setting up constraints based on the participants' schedules and preferences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We will create variables for the day (Monday or Tuesday), start time, and end time. The start and end times will be represented in minutes since midnight to facilitate arithmetic operations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: \n   - **Day Constraint**: The meeting must be on either Monday or Tuesday.\n   - **Duration Constraint**: The meeting duration must be exactly 30 minutes.\n   - **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 (inclusive).\n   - **Participant Availability**: For each participant, the meeting time must not overlap with any of their existing meetings.\n   - **Additional Constraints**: Lawrence cannot meet on Tuesday after 16:30.\n3. **Check for Solution**: Use the Z3 solver to check if there's a satisfying assignment for these variables under the given constraints. If found, convert the solution back to the required day and time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling_problem():\n    # Create the solver\n    solver = Solver()\n\n    # Define the variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes since midnight\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n\n    # Constraints for day\n    solver.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1))\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    solver.add(end_time == start_time + 30)\n\n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    solver.add(start_time >= 9 * 60)\n    solver.add(end_time <= 17 * 60)\n\n    # Jesse's busy times\n    # Monday: 13:30-14:00 (810-840), 14:30-15:00 (870-900)\n    # Tuesday: 9:00-9:30 (540-570), 13:00-13:30 (780-810), 14:00-15:00 (840-900)\n    # Lawrence's busy times\n    # Monday: 9:00-17:00 (540-1020) -> entire day busy\n    # Tuesday: 9:30-10:30 (570-630), 11:30-12:30 (690-750), 13:00-13:30 (780-810), 14:30-15:00 (870-900), 15:30-16:30 (930-990)\n    # Lawrence cannot meet on Tuesday after 16:30 (i.e., meeting must end by 16:30)\n\n    # Constraints for Jesse and Lawrence's schedules\n    # For Jesse: the meeting should not overlap with any of Jesse's meetings on the selected day\n    jesse_monday_busy = Or(\n        And(day == 0, Or(\n            And(start_time < 810, end_time > 540),  # overlaps with 13:30-14:00 (810-840)\n            And(start_time < 840, end_time > 810),\n            And(start_time < 870, end_time > 840),  # overlaps with 14:30-15:00 (870-900)\n            And(start_time < 900, end_time > 870)\n        )),\n        And(day == 1, Or(\n            And(start_time < 570, end_time > 540),  # overlaps with 9:00-9:30 (540-570)\n            And(start_time < 570, end_time > 540),\n            And(start_time < 810, end_time > 780),  # overlaps with 13:00-13:30 (780-810)\n            And(start_time < 810, end_time > 780),\n            And(start_time < 900, end_time > 840)   # overlaps with 14:00-15:00 (840-900)\n        ))\n    )\n    solver.add(Not(jesse_monday_busy))\n\n    # For Lawrence: the meeting should not overlap with any of Lawrence's meetings on the selected day\n    # Lawrence is busy all day Monday (540-1020), so day can't be 0\n    solver.add(day != 0)\n\n    # For Tuesday:\n    lawrence_tuesday_busy = Or(\n        And(start_time < 630, end_time > 570),  # 9:30-10:30 (570-630)\n        And(start_time < 750, end_time > 690),   # 11:30-12:30 (690-750)\n        And(start_time < 810, end_time > 780),   # 13:00-13:30 (780-810)\n        And(start_time < 900, end_time > 870),   # 14:30-15:00 (870-900)\n        And(start_time < 990, end_time > 930)    # 15:30-16:30 (930-990)\n    )\n    solver.add(Not(lawrence_tuesday_busy))\n\n    # Additional constraint: Lawrence cannot meet on Tuesday after 16:30 (so end_time <= 990)\n    solver.add(end_time <= 16 * 60 + 30)\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        day_val = model[day].as_long()\n        start_val = model[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = model[end_time].as_long()\n\n        day_str = \"Monday\" if day_val == 0 else \"Tuesday\"\n        start_hh = start_val // 60\n        start_mm = start_val % 60\n        end_hh = end_val // 60\n        end_mm = end_val % 60\n\n        # Formatting to HH:MM with leading zeros\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling_problem()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variable Definitions**: The variables `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are defined to represent the meeting day (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday) and the start and end times in minutes since midnight.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: \n   - **Day Constraint**: The meeting must be on Monday (0) or Tuesday (1).\n   - **Duration Constraint**: The meeting duration is set to 30 minutes (`end_time = start_time + 30`).\n   - **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must start no earlier than 9:00 (540 minutes) and end no later than 17:00 (1020 minutes).\n   - **Participant Availability**: Constraints ensure the meeting does not overlap with any of Jesse's or Lawrence's existing meetings. Lawrence is entirely busy on Monday, so the meeting must be on Tuesday.\n   - **Additional Constraints**: The meeting must end by 16:30 on Tuesday (990 minutes).\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the model values for day, start time, and end time are converted to the required string format and printed.\n\nThis approach systematically checks all possible meeting times within the given constraints to find a feasible slot that accommodates both participants."
