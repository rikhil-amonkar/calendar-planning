You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Shirley and Albert for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nShirley has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:00; \nAlbert is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nShirley would rather not meet on Tuesday after 10:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting, and then adding constraints based on the participants' schedules and preferences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the day (Monday or Tuesday), start time, and end time. The start and end times will be represented in minutes since 9:00 AM (the start of the workday) to simplify arithmetic constraints.\n2. **Add Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Duration**: The end time must be exactly 30 minutes after the start time.\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 (i.e., start time \u2265 0 and end time \u2264 480 minutes, since 8 hours = 480 minutes).\n   - **Participant Schedules**: The meeting must not overlap with any blocked times in Shirley's and Albert's calendars.\n   - **Preferences**: Shirley prefers not to meet on Tuesday after 10:30 AM (i.e., if the day is Tuesday, the start time must be before 10:30 AM, which is 90 minutes after 9:00 AM).\n3. **Check for Solutions**: Use the Z3 solver to find a valid assignment of day, start time, and end time that satisfies all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_schedule():\n    # Create the solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 0 is 9:00, 30 is 9:30)\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n    \n    # Constraints for day: 0 (Monday) or 1 (Tuesday)\n    solver.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1))\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    solver.add(end_time == start_time + 30)\n    \n    # Meeting must be within work hours (9:00-17:00, so 0 to 480 minutes)\n    solver.add(start_time >= 0)\n    solver.add(end_time <= 480)  # 8 hours * 60 = 480 minutes\n    \n    # Shirley's constraints\n    # Monday blocked: 10:30-11:00 (90-120), 12:00-12:30 (180-210), 16:00-16:30 (420-450)\n    # Tuesday blocked: 9:30-10:00 (30-60)\n    # Shirley's preference: not meet on Tuesday after 10:30 (start_time + 30 <= 90 if day is Tuesday)\n    shirley_monday_blocked = Or(\n        And(day == 0, start_time >= 90, start_time < 120),   # 10:30-11:00\n        And(day == 0, start_time >= 180, start_time < 210),   # 12:00-12:30\n        And(day == 0, start_time >= 420, start_time < 450)    # 16:00-16:30\n    )\n    shirley_tuesday_blocked = And(day == 1, start_time >= 30, start_time < 60)  # 9:30-10:00\n    solver.add(Not(shirley_monday_blocked))\n    solver.add(Not(shirley_tuesday_blocked))\n    \n    # Shirley's preference: not meet on Tuesday after 10:30 (i.e., start_time +30 <= 90)\n    solver.add(Implies(day == 1, start_time + 30 <= 90))\n    \n    # Albert's constraints\n    # Monday: busy all day (9:00-17:00), so no meeting possible on Monday\n    # Tuesday blocked: 9:30-11:00 (30-120), 11:30-12:30 (150-210), 13:00-16:00 (240-420), 16:30-17:00 (450-480)\n    albert_monday_blocked = day == 0\n    albert_tuesday_blocked = Or(\n        And(day == 1, start_time >= 30, start_time < 120),   # 9:30-11:00\n        And(day == 1, start_time >= 150, start_time < 210),   # 11:30-12:30\n        And(day == 1, start_time >= 240, start_time < 420),   # 13:00-16:00\n        And(day == 1, start_time >= 450, start_time < 480)    # 16:30-17:00\n    )\n    solver.add(Not(albert_monday_blocked))\n    solver.add(Not(albert_tuesday_blocked))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        day_val = model[day].as_long()\n        start_val = model[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = model[end_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert day to string\n        day_str = \"Monday\" if day_val == 0 else \"Tuesday\"\n        \n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = 9 + start_val // 60\n        start_mm = start_val % 60\n        end_hh = 9 + end_val // 60\n        end_mm = end_val % 60\n        \n        # Format as two-digit strings\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        \n        # Print the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_schedule()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: The variables `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are defined to represent the meeting day (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday), start time in minutes from 9:00 AM, and end time (start time + 30 minutes).\n2. **Day Constraints**: The meeting must be on Monday or Tuesday.\n3. **Duration and Work Hours**: The meeting lasts 30 minutes and must fit within the 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM window.\n4. **Shirley's Constraints**: The meeting must avoid Shirley's blocked times and adhere to her preference of not meeting after 10:30 AM on Tuesday.\n5. **Albert's Constraints**: The meeting cannot be on Monday (Albert is busy all day) and must avoid his blocked times on Tuesday.\n6. **Solution Extraction**: The solver checks for a valid solution. If found, it converts the day and time variables into readable strings and prints them in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring all constraints and preferences are met."
