You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ryan and Adam for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nRyan has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 12:00 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nAdam is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nRyan can not meet on Wednesday. Adam would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:30. Tuesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting, then adding constraints based on the participants' schedules and preferences. Here's the Python code that implements this solution:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the possible days\n    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 2)  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n\n    # Define the start and end times (in minutes from 9:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (480 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(start_time >= 0, end_time <= 480)\n    s.add(end_time == start_time + meeting_duration)\n\n    # Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday (day 2)\n    s.add(day != 2)\n\n    # Adam wants to avoid Monday before 14:30 (14:30 is 330 minutes from 9:00)\n    # So if day is Monday (0), start_time must be >= 330\n    s.add(Implies(day == 0, start_time >= 330))\n\n    # Ryan's busy slots (in minutes from 9:00)\n    ryan_busy = {\n        0: [(30, 60), (120, 180), (240, 270), (390, 420)],  # Monday\n        1: [(150, 210), (390, 420)],  # Tuesday\n        2: [(180, 240), (390, 420), (450, 480)]  # Wednesday\n    }\n\n    # Adam's busy slots (in minutes from 9:00)\n    adam_busy = {\n        0: [(0, 90), (120, 270), (300, 420), (450, 480)],  # Monday\n        1: [(0, 60), (90, 390), (420, 480)],  # Tuesday\n        2: [(0, 30), (60, 120), (150, 330), (360, 390), (420, 450)]  # Wednesday\n    }\n\n    # Function to check if a time slot overlaps with any busy slots\n    def is_busy(time_slot, busy_slots):\n        start, end = time_slot\n        for busy_start, busy_end in busy_slots:\n            if Not(Or(end <= busy_start, start >= busy_end)):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    # Constraints for Ryan's availability\n    ryan_available = True\n    for day_idx, slots in ryan_busy.items():\n        ryan_available = And(ryan_available, Implies(day == day_idx, Not(is_busy((start_time, end_time), slots))))\n    s.add(ryan_available)\n\n    # Constraints for Adam's availability\n    adam_available = True\n    for day_idx, slots in adam_busy.items():\n        adam_available = And(adam_available, Implies(day == day_idx, Not(is_busy((start_time, end_time), slots))))\n    s.add(adam_available)\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_idx = m[day].as_long()\n        start = m[start_time].as_long()\n        end = m[end_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = 9 + start // 60\n        start_mm = start % 60\n        end_hh = 9 + end // 60\n        end_mm = end % 60\n\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {days[day_idx]}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Day Variable**: The `day` variable is an integer representing Monday (0), Tuesday (1), or Wednesday (2). We constrain it to these values.\n2. **Time Variables**: `start_time` and `end_time` are integers representing minutes from 9:00 AM. The meeting duration is fixed at 30 minutes.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be within work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday (`day != 2`).\n   - Adam prefers no meetings on Monday before 14:30 (330 minutes from 9:00).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of Ryan's or Adam's busy slots.\n4. **Busy Slots**: The busy slots for Ryan and Adam are converted to minutes from 9:00 for each day.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the model is decoded to get the day, start time, and end time, which are then formatted into the required output.\n\nThis code will output the first valid meeting time that satisfies all constraints. If no solution exists (though the problem states one does), it will print \"No solution found\"."
