You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jacob, Diana, Adam, Angela and Dennis for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJacob is busy on Monday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nDiana has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nAdam has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nAngela is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDennis has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining the problem constraints and letting Z3 find a feasible meeting time that fits everyone's schedules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need a start time variable for the meeting, which will be constrained within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n2. **Extract Busy Slots**: For each participant, extract their busy intervals during the day.\n3. **Add Constraints**: Ensure the meeting does not overlap with any of the busy intervals for any participant. The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so the end time is start time + 30 minutes.\n4. **Check Feasibility**: Use Z3 to check if there's a start time that satisfies all constraints. If found, convert the model's solution to a readable time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_schedule():\n    # Define the start time variable (in minutes from 9:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (480 minutes from 9:00 to 17:00)\n    total_minutes_in_work_hours = 8 * 60  # 9:00-17:00 is 8 hours\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    end_time = start_time + meeting_duration\n    \n    # Initialize solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Constraint: start_time must be within work hours (0 to 480 - meeting_duration minutes)\n    solver.add(start_time >= 0)\n    solver.add(end_time <= total_minutes_in_work_hours)\n    \n    # Each person's busy intervals in minutes from 9:00\n    # Jacob's busy intervals: 13:30-14:00 (270-300), 14:30-15:00 (330-360)\n    jacob_busy = [(270, 300), (330, 360)]\n    # Diana's busy intervals: 9:30-10:00 (30-60), 11:30-12:00 (150-180), 13:00-13:30 (240-270), 16:00-16:30 (420-450)\n    diana_busy = [(30, 60), (150, 180), (240, 270), (420, 450)]\n    # Adam's busy intervals: 9:30-10:30 (30-90), 11:00-12:30 (120-210), 15:30-16:00 (390-420)\n    adam_busy = [(30, 90), (120, 210), (390, 420)]\n    # Angela's busy intervals: 9:30-10:00 (30-60), 10:30-12:00 (90-180), 13:00-15:30 (240-390), 16:00-16:30 (420-450)\n    angela_busy = [(30, 60), (90, 180), (240, 390), (420, 450)]\n    # Dennis's busy intervals: 9:00-9:30 (0-30), 10:30-11:30 (90-150), 13:00-15:00 (240-360), 16:30-17:00 (450-480)\n    dennis_busy = [(0, 30), (90, 150), (240, 360), (450, 480)]\n    \n    # Combine all busy intervals for all participants\n    all_busy = []\n    all_busy.extend(jacob_busy)\n    all_busy.extend(diana_busy)\n    all_busy.extend(adam_busy)\n    all_busy.extend(angela_busy)\n    all_busy.extend(dennis_busy)\n    \n    # Add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with any busy interval\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in all_busy:\n        solver.add(Or(\n            end_time <= busy_start,\n            start_time >= busy_end\n        ))\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes back to HH:MM format\n        hours = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes_remainder = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes_remainder:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_schedule()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variable Definition**: The `start_time` variable represents the meeting's start time in minutes from 9:00 AM.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting fits within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and doesn't overlap with any participant's busy intervals.\n3. **Busy Intervals Handling**: Each participant's busy intervals are converted into minutes from 9:00 AM. The solver checks that the meeting (start time to start time + 30 minutes) does not overlap with any of these intervals.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible time is found, the solver returns the start time in minutes, which is then converted back to a 24-hour format for readability.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring the solution meets all given constraints."
