You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Gregory, Natalie, Christine and Vincent for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nGregory has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00; \nNatalie's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nChristine has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 17:00; \nVincent has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the start time of the meeting and ensuring that the chosen time slot doesn't conflict with any of the participants' existing schedules. The meeting duration is fixed at 30 minutes, and the meeting must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert all time slots into minutes from the start of the day (9:00 AM) to simplify calculations. For example, 9:00 AM is 0 minutes, 10:00 AM is 60 minutes, etc.\n2. **Define Constraints**: For each participant, their busy intervals are converted into minutes and constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap with any of these intervals.\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**: Use Z3 to find a start time (in minutes) such that the 30-minute meeting slot does not overlap with any busy intervals of any participant. The solver checks for a feasible start time within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00, i.e., 0 to 480 minutes).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 represents 9:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    \n    # Total working hours: 9:00 to 17:00 is 8 hours = 480 minutes\n    max_time = 480\n    \n    # Constraint: start_time must be >= 0 and <= max_time - duration\n    s.add(start_time >= 0)\n    s.add(start_time <= max_time - duration)\n    \n    # Define the busy intervals for each participant in minutes from 9:00\n    # Gregory's busy intervals\n    gregory_busy = [\n        (0, 60),      # 9:00-10:00\n        (90, 150),     # 10:30-11:30\n        (210, 240),    # 12:30-13:00\n        (270, 300)     # 13:30-14:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Natalie has no busy intervals\n    \n    # Christine's busy intervals\n    christine_busy = [\n        (0, 150),      # 9:00-11:30\n        (270, 480)      # 13:30-17:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Vincent's busy intervals\n    vincent_busy = [\n        (0, 30),        # 9:00-9:30\n        (90, 180),      # 10:30-12:00\n        (210, 300),     # 12:30-14:00\n        (330, 480)      # 14:30-17:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Function to add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with any busy interval\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(busy_intervals):\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_intervals:\n            # The meeting should not overlap with this interval: so either meeting ends before busy_start or starts after busy_end\n            s.add(Or(\n                start_time + duration <= busy_start,\n                start_time >= busy_end\n            ))\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant's busy intervals\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(gregory_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(christine_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(vincent_busy)\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_min = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_min back to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = 9 + start_min // 60\n        start_minute = start_min % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        end_min = start_min + duration\n        end_hour = 9 + end_min // 60\n        end_minute = end_min % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variable Definition**: The start time of the meeting is defined as an integer variable representing minutes from 9:00 AM.\n3. **Constraints Setup**: The start time must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00) and the meeting duration is set to 30 minutes.\n4. **Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are converted into minutes from 9:00 AM. For example, 10:30 AM is 90 minutes (60 minutes for 10:00 AM plus 30 minutes).\n5. **Non-Overlapping Constraints**: For each busy interval, constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap. The meeting must either end before the busy interval starts or start after it ends.\n6. **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format and printed along with the end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible time slots within the given constraints to find a suitable meeting time for all participants."
