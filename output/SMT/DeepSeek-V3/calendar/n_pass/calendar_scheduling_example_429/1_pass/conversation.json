You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Judy, Olivia, Eric, Jacqueline, Laura, Tyler and Lisa for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJudy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nOlivia is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30; \nEric is free the entire day.\nJacqueline has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nLaura is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nTyler has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; \nLisa has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The approach involves defining the problem constraints and then letting Z3 find a valid time slot that satisfies all constraints. Here's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Participants and their busy slots on Monday (in 24-hour format)\n    busy_slots = {\n        'Judy': [(13, 0, 13, 30), (16, 0, 16, 30)],\n        'Olivia': [(10, 0, 10, 30), (12, 0, 13, 0), (14, 0, 14, 30)],\n        'Eric': [],  # Free all day\n        'Jacqueline': [(10, 0, 10, 30), (15, 0, 15, 30)],\n        'Laura': [(9, 0, 10, 0), (10, 30, 12, 0), (13, 0, 13, 30), (14, 30, 15, 0), (15, 30, 17, 0)],\n        'Tyler': [(9, 0, 10, 0), (11, 0, 11, 30), (12, 30, 13, 0), (14, 0, 14, 30), (15, 30, 17, 0)],\n        'Lisa': [(9, 30, 10, 30), (11, 0, 11, 30), (12, 0, 12, 30), (13, 0, 13, 30), (14, 0, 14, 30), (16, 0, 17, 0)]\n    }\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    \n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM)\n    work_start = (9, 0)   # 9:00 AM\n    work_end = (17, 0)     # 5:00 PM\n    \n    # Convert all times to minutes since 00:00 for easier calculation\n    def time_to_minutes(hour, minute):\n        return hour * 60 + minute\n    \n    work_start_min = time_to_minutes(*work_start)\n    work_end_min = time_to_minutes(*work_end)\n    \n    # Create a Z3 solver instance\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # The meeting start time in minutes since 00:00\n    meeting_start = Int('meeting_start')\n    \n    # Constraints:\n    # 1.
