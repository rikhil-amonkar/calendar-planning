You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Daniel and Bradley for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nDaniel is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 14:00 to 14:30, Thursday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Friday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBradley is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, Tuesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30, Friday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:30; \n\nDaniel would rather not meet on Wednesday. Thursday. Bradley do not want to meet on Monday. Tuesday before 12:00. Friday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the constraints of each participant's schedule and preferences, then finding a time slot that satisfies all conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day will be represented as an integer (0 to 4 for Monday to Friday), and the start and end times will be in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes, since 9:00 AM is 540 minutes past midnight).\n2. **Constraints for Meeting Duration**: The meeting duration must be exactly 30 minutes, so the end time is start time + 30.\n3. **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must start no earlier than 9:00 (540 minutes) and end no later than 17:00 (1020 minutes).\n4. **Busy Slots Constraints**: For each participant, their busy slots must not overlap with the meeting time. This is checked by ensuring the meeting does not start during any busy interval.\n5. **Preferences Constraints**: Incorporate each participant's preferences regarding days and times they would rather not meet.\n6. **Solve and Extract Solution**: Use Z3 to find a feasible solution that meets all constraints. Convert the solution back to the required day and time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize Z3 solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Days: 0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, 2=Wednesday, 3=Thursday, 4=Friday\n    day = Int('day')\n    start_time_min = Int('start_time_min')  # in minutes since midnight\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    end_time_min = start_time_min + meeting_duration\n    \n    # Work hours are 9:00 (540) to 17:00 (1020)\n    solver.add(day >= 0, day <= 4)\n    solver.add(start_time_min >= 540)\n    solver.add(end_time_min <= 1020)\n    \n    # Daniel's busy slots per day\n    daniel_busy = {\n        0: [(570, 630), (720, 750), (780, 840), (870, 900), (930, 960)],  # Monday\n        1: [(660, 720), (780, 810), (930, 960), (990, 1020)],             # Tuesday\n        2: [(540, 600), (840, 870)],                                      # Wednesday\n        3: [(630, 660), (720, 780), (870, 900), (930, 960)],              # Thursday\n        4: [(540, 570), (690, 720), (780, 810), (990, 1020)]              # Friday\n    }\n    \n    # Bradley's busy slots per day\n    bradley_busy = {\n        0: [(570, 660), (690, 720), (750, 780), (840, 900)],              # Monday\n        1: [(630, 660), (720, 780), (810, 840), (930, 990)],              # Tuesday\n        2: [(540, 600), (660, 780), (810, 840), (870, 1020)],            # Wednesday\n        3: [(540, 750), (810, 840), (870, 900), (930, 990)],             # Thursday\n        4: [(540, 570), (600, 750), (780, 810), (840, 870), (930, 990)]  # Friday\n    }\n    \n    # Constraints for Daniel's busy slots\n    for d in daniel_busy:\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in daniel_busy[d]:\n            solver.add(Not(And(day == d, \n                              start_time_min < busy_end, \n                              end_time_min > busy_start)))\n    \n    # Constraints for Bradley's busy slots\n    for d in bradley_busy:\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in bradley_busy[d]:\n            solver.add(Not(And(day == d, \n                              start_time_min < busy_end, \n                              end_time_min > busy_start)))\n    \n    # Daniel's preferences: not Wednesday, not Thursday\n    solver.add(day != 2)  # Wednesday\n    solver.add(day != 3)  # Thursday\n    \n    # Bradley's preferences: not Monday, not Tuesday before 12:00, not Friday\n    solver.add(day != 0)  # Monday\n    solver.add(Not(And(day == 1, start_time_min < 720)))  # Tuesday before 12:00 (720 minutes)\n    solver.add(day != 4)  # Friday\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        day_val = model[day].as_long()\n        start_min_val = model[start_time_min].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert day_val to day name\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n        day_name = days[day_val]\n        \n        # Convert start_min_val to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = start_min_val // 60\n        start_mm = start_min_val % 60\n        start_time = f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_min_val = start_min_val + 30\n        end_hh = end_min_val // 60\n        end_mm = end_min_val % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized, and variables for the day and start time (in minutes since midnight) are created.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The meeting duration is set to 30 minutes, and constraints ensure the meeting fits within work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n3. **Busy Slots Handling**: For each participant, their busy slots are defined. The solver ensures the meeting does not overlap with any of these slots.\n4. **Preferences Handling**: Daniel prefers not to meet on Wednesday or Thursday. Bradley prefers not to meet on Monday, Tuesday before 12:00, or Friday. These preferences are added as constraints.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the model is queried for the day and start time. These values are converted to the required format (day name and HH:MM) and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently encodes all constraints and uses Z3's powerful solving capabilities to find a feasible meeting time that respects everyone's schedules and preferences."
