You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Tyler and Ruth for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nTyler is busy on Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:30 to 15:00, Wednesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nRuth has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nTyler would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a feasible meeting time that satisfies all constraints. The approach involves encoding the participants' busy times, their preferences, and the meeting duration into logical constraints that Z3 can solve.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day will be represented as an integer (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, 2 for Wednesday), and the start and end times will be in minutes since 9:00 AM (work hours start at 9:00).\n2. **Constraints Setup**:\n   - **Day Constraint**: The meeting must be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n   - **Time Constraints**: The meeting must be within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and last exactly 30 minutes.\n   - **Busy Times**: For each participant, the meeting time must not overlap with their busy times on the selected day.\n   - **Preferences**: Tyler prefers no meetings on Monday before 16:00, so if the day is Monday, the start time must be at or after 16:00.\n3. **Solve**: Use Z3 to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.

Constraints ensure the meeting is within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and lasts 30 minutes.\n2. **Busy Times Handling**: For each participant, constraints are added to prevent the meeting from overlapping with their busy times on specific days. For example, if the meeting is on Tuesday, it must not overlap with Tyler's busy periods (9:00-9:30 and 14:30-15:00).\n3. **Preferences Handling**: Tyler's preference to avoid meetings before 16:00 on Monday is encoded as a constraint that the start time on Monday must be at or after 16:00.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: The Z3 solver checks for a feasible solution. If found, the solution is converted from minutes and day indices back to the required day name and 24-hour time format for output.\n\nThis approach efficiently encodes the scheduling problem into logical constraints solvable by Z3, ensuring all constraints and preferences are met."
