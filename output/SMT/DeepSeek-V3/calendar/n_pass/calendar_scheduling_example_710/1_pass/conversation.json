You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Cheryl and Kyle for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nCheryl is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 15:00 to 15:30; \nKyle is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nCheryl can not meet on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the constraints of each participant's schedule and finding a time slot that satisfies all conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables to represent the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day can be one of Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. The start and end times should be within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00) and the duration should be exactly 30 minutes.\n2. **Constraints for Each Participant**:\n   - **Cheryl's Constraints**: Cheryl cannot meet on Wednesday. On Monday and Tuesday, she has specific busy slots that must be avoided.\n   - **Kyle's Constraints**: Kyle has busy slots on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday that must be avoided.\n3. **Combine Constraints**: The solution must find a time slot where neither Cheryl nor Kyle is busy, the meeting is on Monday or Tuesday (since Cheryl can't meet on Wednesday), and the duration is 30 minutes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_scheduling():\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the possible days: Monday (0), Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 2)  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n\n    # Cheryl cannot meet on Wednesday, so day must be 0 or 1\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1))\n\n    # Define start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes) to 17:00 (1020 minutes)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= 540, start_time <= 990)  # 990 = 16:30, as meeting duration is 30 minutes\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    end_time = start_time + 30\n    s.add(end_time <= 1020)  # Ensure end time is not beyond 17:00\n\n    # Cheryl's busy slots\n    # Monday: 9:00-9:30 (540-570), 11:30-13:00 (690-780), 15:30-16:00 (930-960)\n    # Tuesday: 15:00-15:30 (900-930)\n    def cheryl_busy(d, st, et):\n        return Or(\n            And(d == 0, Or(\n                And(st < 570, et > 540),   # overlaps with 9:00-9:30\n                And(st < 780, et > 690),   # overlaps with 11:30-13:00\n                And(st < 960, et > 930)    # overlaps with 15:30-16:00\n            )),\n            And(d == 1, And(st < 930, et > 900))  # overlaps with 15:00-15:30 on Tuesday\n        )\n\n    # Kyle's busy slots\n    # Monday: 9:00-17:00 (540-1020) \u2192 entire day, so no available time on Monday\n    # Tuesday: 9:30-17:00 (570-1020)\n    # Wednesday: 9:00-9:30 (540-570), 10:00-13:00 (600-780), 13:30-14:00 (810-840), 14:30-17:00 (870-1020)\n    def kyle_busy(d, st, et):\n        return Or(\n            And(d == 0, Or(And(st < 1020, et > 540))),  # entire Monday is busy\n            And(d == 1, Or(And(st < 1020, et > 570))),  # Tuesday after 9:30\n            And(d == 2, Or(\n                And(st < 570, et > 540),   # 9:00-9:30\n                And(st < 780, et > 600),   # 10:00-13:00\n                And(st < 840, et > 810),   # 13:30-14:00\n                And(st < 1020, et > 870)    # 14:30-17:00\n            ))\n        )\n\n    # The meeting time should not overlap with any busy slots for Cheryl or Kyle\n    s.add(Not(cheryl_busy(day, start_time, end_time)))\n    s.add(Not(kyle_busy(day, start_time, end_time)))\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = start_val + 30\n\n        # Convert day number to day name\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_name = days[day_val]\n\n        # Convert minutes to HH:MM format\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            hh = minutes // 60\n            mm = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{hh:02d}:{mm:02d}\"\n\n        start_time_str = minutes_to_time(start_val)\n        end_time_str = minutes_to_time(end_val)\n\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**:\n   - **Day**: Represented as an integer (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, 2 for Wednesday). Constraints ensure it's either Monday or Tuesday (Cheryl can't meet on Wednesday).\n   - **Start Time**: Represented in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes) to 16:30 (990 minutes) to ensure the 30-minute meeting ends by 17:00.\n   - **End Time**: Simply start time plus 30 minutes.\n2. **Busy Slots Handling**:\n   - **Cheryl's Busy Slots**: Defined for Monday and Tuesday. The solver ensures the meeting doesn't overlap with these slots.\n   - **Kyle's Busy Slots**: Defined for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. The solver checks for non-overlapping times, especially noting that Kyle is busy all day Monday and after 9:30 on Tuesday.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the model is queried for the day and start time, converting these into readable formats (day name and HH:MM time). The solution is printed in the specified format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring all constraints are met before proposing a solution."
