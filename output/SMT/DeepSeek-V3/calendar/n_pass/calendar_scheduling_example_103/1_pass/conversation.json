You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diane, Jack, Eugene and Patricia for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDiane has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nJack has blocked their calendar on Monday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nEugene has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30; \nPatricia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the participants' schedules and finding a 30-minute window where all participants are available between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model Time Slots**: We'll represent each 30-minute interval within the 9:00 to 17:00 window as a potential meeting time. The meeting must fit entirely within one of these intervals.\n2. **Check Availability**: For each participant, we'll check their blocked times to ensure the chosen interval does not overlap with any of their blocked periods.\n3. **Constraints**: We'll use Z3 to encode the constraints that the meeting time must not conflict with any participant's schedule.\n4. **Solve**: The Z3 solver will find a valid time slot that meets all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Participants' blocked time slots on Monday (in 24-hour format)\n    blocked_slots = {\n        'Diane': [(9, 30, 10, 0), (14, 30, 15, 0)],\n        'Jack': [(13, 30, 14, 0), (14, 30, 15, 0)],\n        'Eugene': [(9, 0, 10, 0), (10, 30, 11, 30), (12, 0, 14, 30), (15, 0, 16, 30)],\n        'Patricia': [(9, 30, 10, 30), (11, 0, 12, 0), (12, 30, 14, 0), (15, 0, 16, 30)]\n    }\n    \n    # Create a Z3 solver instance\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Possible meeting start times are from 9:00 to 16:30 (since meeting is 30 minutes)\n    # Represent start time in minutes since 9:00 (0 to 450 minutes, since 9:00-17:00 is 8 hours = 480 minutes)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    solver.add(start_time >= 0)  # 9:00 is 0 minutes\n    solver.add(start_time <= 450)  # 16:30 is 450 minutes (16*60 +30 - 9*60 = 450)\n    \n    # Function to check if the meeting time overlaps with any blocked slot\n    def is_overlap(meeting_start, meeting_end, block_start, block_end):\n        # Convert block times to minutes since 9:00\n        block_start_min = (block_start[0] - 9) * 60 + block_start[1]\n        block_end_min = (block_end[0] - 9) * 60 + block_end[1]\n        # Check if the meeting overlaps with the block\n        return Or(\n            And(meeting_start >= block_start_min, meeting_start < block_end_min),\n            And(meeting_end > block_start_min, meeting_end <= block_end_min),\n            And(meeting_start <= block_start_min, meeting_end >= block_end_min)\n        )\n    \n    # For each participant, ensure the meeting does not overlap with any of their blocked slots\n    for participant, slots in blocked_slots.items():\n        constraints = []\n        for slot in slots:\n            block_start_hr, block_start_min, block_end_hr, block_end_min = slot\n            meeting_end_time = start_time + meeting_duration\n            overlap = is_overlap(start_time, meeting_end_time, \n                                (block_start_hr, block_start_min), \n                                (block_end_hr, block_end_min))\n            constraints.append(Not(overlap))\n        # The meeting should not overlap with any of the participant's blocked slots\n        solver.add(And(constraints))\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_min = model.eval(start_time).as_long()\n        start_hr = 9 + start_min // 60\n        start_min_remainder = start_min % 60\n        end_min = start_min + meeting_duration\n        end_hr = 9 + end_min // 60\n        end_min_remainder = end_min % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hr:02d}:{start_min_remainder:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hr:02d}:{end_min_remainder:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Blocked Slots**: The blocked times for each participant are listed in a dictionary, where each entry maps a participant's name to their list of blocked time intervals.\n2. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver is initialized to find a start time (in minutes since 9:00) for the meeting such that the 30-minute duration does not overlap with any blocked slots.\n3. **Overlap Check**: The `is_overlap` function checks if the proposed meeting time overlaps with any blocked slot by converting all times into minutes since 9:00 and using logical constraints to detect overlaps.\n4. **Constraints**: For each participant, constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap with any of their blocked times.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the start time in minutes is converted back to hours and minutes, and the result is printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring the solution meets all given constraints."
