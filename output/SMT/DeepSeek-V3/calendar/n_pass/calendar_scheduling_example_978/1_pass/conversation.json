You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Brian and Julia for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBrian is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, Wednesday during 12:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Friday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nJulia is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 13:00 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 17:00, Friday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \n\nBrian would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a meeting time that satisfies all constraints. The approach involves encoding the participants' busy schedules, their preferences, and the meeting duration into logical constraints that Z3 can solve.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the day of the meeting (encoded as an integer), the start time (in minutes from 9:00 AM), and the duration (fixed at 60 minutes).\n2. **Constraints for Valid Times**: The meeting must start within working hours (9:00 to 17:00) and end by 17:00.\n3. **Busy Schedules**: For each participant, we'll add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with their busy intervals.\n4. **Preferences**: Brian prefers to avoid Monday, so we'll add a constraint to prioritize other days if possible.\n5. **Earliest Availability**: To find the earliest possible meeting time, we'll minimize the start time across all days.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday, 3: Thursday, 4: Friday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 0 = 9:00, 60 = 10:00)\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes)\n    duration = 60\n    \n    # Constraints for day: must be between 0 (Monday) and 4 (Friday)\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 4)\n    \n    # Constraints for start_time: must be between 0 (9:00) and 480 (17:00 - duration)\n    s.add(start_time >= 0, start_time <= 480 - duration)\n    \n    # Define the busy times for Brian and Julia for each day\n    # Each entry is (day, start_min, end_min)\n    # Convert HH:MM to minutes since 9:00.

Constraints ensure these values are within valid working hours and days.\n2. **Busy Intervals**: For each participant, their busy intervals are converted into constraints that the meeting must not overlap with.\n3. **Preferences**: The solver first attempts to find a solution excluding Monday (day 0). If none is found, it allows Monday.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: The earliest valid meeting time is extracted from the model, converted to a readable format, and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times using logical constraints, ensuring the solution meets all given conditions and preferences."
