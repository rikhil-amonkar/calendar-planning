        "content": "Given the following scheduling problem:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Stephanie and Betty for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nStephanie has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, Tuesday during 12:00 to 13:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 13:00 to 14:00; \nBetty has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nStephanie would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. Betty can not meet on Tuesday after 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the problem constraints into logical expressions that Z3 can process to find a valid meeting time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We will create variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day will be represented as an integer (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, 2 for Wednesday), and the start and end times will be integers representing minutes from the start of the workday (9:00 AM).\n2. **Constraints Setup**:\n   - **Day Constraints**: The meeting must be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n   - **Time Constraints**: The meeting must be within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and last exactly one hour.\n   - **Participant Schedules**: The meeting time must not overlap with any existing meetings of Stephanie or Betty on the chosen day.\n   - **Preferences**: Stephanie prefers to avoid Monday, and Betty cannot meet on Tuesday after 12:30.\n3. **Solve Constraints**: Use Z3 to find a solution that satisfies all constraints. If a solution exists, convert the solution back to the desired day and time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes in 24-hour format)\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n\n    # Constraints for day: must be 0, 1, or 2\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1, day == 2))\n\n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes in 24-hour format)\n    # Meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540)  # 9:00\n    s.add(end_time == start_time + 60)\n    s.add(end_time <= 1020)   # 17:00\n\n    # Stephanie's existing meetings per day (each is a tuple of start and end in minutes from 0:00)\n    stephanie_schedule = {\n        0: [(570, 600), (630, 660), (690, 720), (840, 870)],  # Monday\n        1: [(720, 780)],                                       # Tuesday\n        2: [(540, 600), (780, 840)]                           # Wednesday\n    }\n\n    # Betty's existing meetings per day\n    betty_schedule = {\n        0: [(540, 600), (660, 690), (870, 900), (930, 960)],  # Monday\n        1: [(540, 570), (690, 720), (750, 870), (930, 960)],  # Tuesday\n        2: [(600, 690), (720, 840), (870, 1020)]              # Wednesday\n    }\n\n    # Constraint: The meeting does not overlap with any of Stephanie's meetings on the selected day\n    def no_overlap_with_person(day_var, person_schedule):\n        constraints = []\n        for d, meetings in person_schedule.items():\n            for (meet_start, meet_end) in meetings:\n                # If the meeting is on day d, then the new meeting must not overlap\n                constraints.append(\n                    Implies(day_var == d,\n                            Or(start_time >= meet_end,\n                               end_time <= meet_start)\n                    )\n                )\n        return constraints\n\n    s.add(no_overlap_with_person(day, stephanie_schedule))\n    s.add(no_overlap_with_person(day, betty_schedule))\n\n    # Stephanie prefers to avoid Monday (day 0)\n    s.add(day != 0)\n\n    # Betty cannot meet on Tuesday after 12:30 (750 minutes from 0:00 is 12:30)\n    # So on Tuesday, the meeting must end by 12:30 or start after 12:30 (but given meeting is 1 hour, start_time must be <= 750 - 60 = 690)\n    s.add(Implies(day == 1, start_time + 60 <= 750))\n\n    # Check for solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        day_val = model[day].as_long()\n        start_val = model[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = model[end_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert day_val to day name\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_name = days[day_val]\n\n        # Convert start and end times from minutes to HH:MM format\n        def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n            h = minutes // 60\n            m = minutes % 60\n            return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n\n        start_time_str = minutes_to_time(start_val)\n        end_time_str = minutes_to_time(end_val)\n\n        # Print solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The variables `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are defined to represent the meeting day and time. Constraints ensure the meeting is within work hours and does not overlap with existing meetings.\n2. **Existing Schedules**: The schedules of Stephanie and Betty are encoded as dictionaries where each day maps to a list of time intervals (in minutes from midnight) during which they have meetings.\n3. **Overlap Checks**: The `no_overlap_with_person` function generates constraints ensuring the new meeting does not overlap with any existing meetings for the selected day.\n4. **Preferences and Additional Constraints**: Stephanie's preference to avoid Monday and Betty's constraint on Tuesday after 12:30 are added to the solver.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the model values are converted to the desired day name and time format (HH:MM) for output.\n\nThis approach systematically encodes all constraints and uses Z3 to find a feasible meeting time that adheres to all given conditions."
