You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Deborah and Albert for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDeborah is free the entire day.\nAlbert has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 15:00 to 16:30; \n\nAlbert can not meet on Monday after 11:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The solver checks for a valid solution and converts the time back to `HH:MM` format.\n\n### Output:\nThe solver will output the earliest valid meeting time that satisfies all constraints. In this case, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION:\nDay: Monday\nStart Time: 10:00\nEnd Time: 10:30\n```"
