You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Deborah and Albert for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDeborah is free the entire day.\nAlbert has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 15:00 to 16:30; \n\nAlbert can not meet on Monday after 11:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a valid meeting time that satisfies all constraints. The constraints include the participants' availability, the meeting duration, and any additional preferences or restrictions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need to define variables for the start time of the meeting. The start time will be represented in minutes since the start of the workday (9:00 AM) to simplify calculations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**:\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must start and end within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - **Meeting Duration**: The meeting duration is 30 minutes.\n   - **Participant Availability**: The meeting must not overlap with any blocked times in the participants' schedules. Additionally, Albert cannot meet after 11:00 AM, which means the meeting must end by 11:00 AM.\n3. **Check for Solutions**: Using the Z3 solver, we check if there's a start time that meets all constraints. If found, we convert the start time from minutes back to a 24-hour format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (9*60 to 17*60 in minutes)\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    \n    # Define the start time variable (in minutes since 00:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Albert's constraints:\n    # Albert's blocked times in minutes since 00:00:\n    # 9:00-10:00 (540-600), 10:30-12:00 (630-720), 15:00-16:30 (900-990)\n    # Also, Albert cannot meet after 11:00 (660 minutes)\n    \n    # The meeting must end by 11:00 (start_time + duration <= 660)\n    # So end time is start_time + duration \u2264 11:00 (660 minutes)\n    \n    # Constraints:\n    # 1. Meeting must start within work hours (start_time >= 540 and start_time + duration <= 1020)\n    solver.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    solver.add(start_time + duration <= work_end)\n    \n    # 2. Meeting must end by 11:00 (660 minutes)\n    solver.add(start_time + duration <= 11 * 60)\n    \n    # 3. The meeting should not overlap with Albert's blocked times\n    # Albert's blocked intervals:\n    blocked_intervals = [\n        (9 * 60, 10 * 60),      # 9:00-10:00\n        (10 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60), # 10:30-12:00\n        (15 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)  # 15:00-16:30\n    ]\n    \n    for (block_start, block_end) in blocked_intervals:\n        # The meeting is outside the blocked interval: \n        # meeting ends before block starts OR starts after block ends\n        solver.add(Or(\n            start_time + duration <= block_start,\n            start_time >= block_end\n        ))\n    \n    # Deborah is free all day, so no constraints from her\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model.evaluate(start_time).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes back to HH:MM format\n        hours = start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_minutes = start_minutes + duration\n        end_hours = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes_remainder = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes_remainder:02d}\"\n        \n        # Prepare the solution output\n        solution = f\"SOLUTION:\\nDay: Monday\\nStart Time: {start_time_str}\\nEnd Time: {end_time_str}\"\n        return solution\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables and Constraints**:\n   - **Start Time**: Represented in minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes) to facilitate arithmetic operations.\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must start no earlier than 9:00 AM and end no later than 5:00 PM (1020 minutes).\n   - **Albert's Restrictions**: The meeting must end by 11:00 AM (660 minutes). Additionally, the meeting should not overlap with any of Albert's blocked time intervals.\n3. **Blocked Intervals Handling**: For each blocked interval, the solver ensures the meeting either starts after the interval ends or ends before the interval starts.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a valid start time is found, it is converted back to a 24-hour format for readability. The solution is then formatted and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving, ensuring all participant schedules and preferences are respected."
