You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Bradley, Teresa, Elizabeth and Christian for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nBradley has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nTeresa has meetings on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nElizabeth has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nChristian has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem as a set of constraints where we find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that doesn't overlap with any of the participants' blocked times.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the start time of the meeting in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes in 24-hour format) to handle time arithmetic easily.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so the end time is start time + 30.\n   - The meeting must entirely fit within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00, i.e., 540 to 1020 minutes).\n   - The meeting should not overlap with any blocked time slots of any participant.\n3. **Check for Solution**: Use Z3 to check if there's a feasible start time that meets all constraints. If found, convert the start time back to HH:MM format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time in minutes since 9:00 (540 minutes in 24-hour format)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    end_time = start_time + duration\n    \n    # Working hours: 9:00 (540) to 17:00 (1020)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540)  # 9:00\n    s.add(end_time <= 1020)   # 17:00\n    \n    # Define each participant's busy slots in minutes since midnight\n    # Bradley's busy slots:\n    bradley_busy = [\n        (570, 600),    # 9:30-10:00\n        (750, 780),    # 12:30-13:00\n        (810, 840),    # 13:30-14:00\n        (930, 960)     # 15:30-16:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Teresa's busy slots:\n    teresa_busy = [\n        (630, 660),    # 10:30-11:00\n        (720, 750),    # 12:00-12:30\n        (780, 810),    # 13:00-13:30\n        (870, 900)      # 14:30-15:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Elizabeth's busy slots:\n    elizabeth_busy = [\n        (540, 570),     # 9:00-9:30\n        (630, 690),     # 10:30-11:30\n        (780, 810),     # 13:00-13:30\n        (870, 900),     # 14:30-15:00\n        (930, 1020)     # 15:30-17:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Christian's busy slots:\n    christian_busy = [\n        (540, 570),     # 9:00-9:30\n        (630, 1020)      # 10:30-17:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Function to add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with any busy slot\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(busy_slots):\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_slots:\n            # The meeting must be either entirely before or entirely after the busy slot\n            s.add(Or(end_time <= busy_start, start_time >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(bradley_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(teresa_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(elizabeth_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(christian_busy)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_minutes = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        hours = start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_minutes = start_minutes + duration\n        hours_end = end_minutes // 60\n        minutes_end = end_minutes % 60\n        end_str = f\"{hours_end:02d}:{minutes_end:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: The start time of the meeting is modeled as an integer variable representing minutes since 9:00 (540 minutes in 24-hour format). The end time is simply start time plus 30 minutes.\n2. **Working Hours Constraint**: The meeting must start no earlier than 9:00 (540 minutes) and end no later than 17:00 (1020 minutes).\n3. **Busy Slots Handling**: For each participant, their busy slots are converted into minute ranges. The solver ensures the meeting does not overlap with any of these slots by requiring the meeting to be entirely before or after each busy slot.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format for readability. The solution is printed in the specified format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring the solution meets all given constraints."
