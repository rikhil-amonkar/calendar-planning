You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Bryan and Nicholas for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBryan has meetings on Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, Friday during 10:30 to 11:00, 14:00 to 14:30; \nNicholas has meetings on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30, Thursday during 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Friday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nBryan would like to avoid more meetings on Tuesday. Nicholas would rather not meet on Monday. Thursday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a feasible meeting time that satisfies all constraints. The approach involves encoding the participants' schedules and preferences into logical constraints that Z3 can reason about.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day will be represented as an integer (0 to 4 for Monday to Friday), and the start and end times will be in minutes since 9:00 AM (work hours start at 9:00).\n2. **Constraints Setup**:\n   - **Day Constraints**: The meeting must occur on one of the specified days (Monday to Friday), but respecting Bryan's preference to avoid Tuesday and Nicholas's preferences to avoid Monday and Thursday.\n   - **Time Constraints**: The meeting must last exactly one hour (60 minutes) and must fit within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - **Schedule Conflicts**: The meeting must not overlap with any existing meetings for Bryan or Nicholas on the chosen day.\n3. **Solve with Z3**: The solver will check for a feasible assignment of day, start time, and end time that meets all constraints. If a solution exists, it will be printed; otherwise, an error will be raised (though the problem states a solution exists).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_schedule():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday, 3: Thursday, 4: Friday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 0 is 9:00, 60 is 10:00)\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n    \n    # Day constraints: day must be 0-4 (Monday to Friday)\n    solver.add(day >= 0, day <= 4)\n    \n    # Bryan prefers to avoid Tuesday (day 1)\n    solver.add(day != 1)\n    \n    # Nicholas prefers to avoid Monday (day 0) and Thursday (day 3)\n    solver.add(day != 0, day != 3)\n    \n    # Now possible days are 2 (Wednesday) or 4 (Friday)\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes)\n    solver.add(end_time == start_time + 60)\n    \n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (480 minutes from 9:00)\n    solver.add(start_time >= 0, end_time <= 480)  # 8 hours * 60 minutes = 480\n    \n    # Function to add busy slots for a person on a specific day\n    def add_busy_slots(day_val, busy_slots):\n        # busy_slots is a list of (start, end) in minutes from 9:00\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_slots:\n            solver.add(Not(And(day == day_val,\n                               start_time < busy_end,\n                               end_time > busy_start)))\n    \n    # Bryan's busy slots per day\n    bryan_busy = {\n        3: [(30, 60), (150, 180)],  # Thursday: 9:30-10:00, 12:30-13:00\n        4: [(90, 120), (300, 330)]   # Friday: 10:30-11:00, 14:00-14:30\n    }\n    \n    # Nicholas's busy slots per day\n    nicholas_busy = {\n        0: [(150, 180), (240, 390)],  # Monday: 11:30-12:00, 13:00-15:30\n        1: [(0, 30), (120, 270), (300, 450)],  # Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-13:30, 14:00-16:30\n        2: [(0, 30), (60, 120), (150, 270), (300, 330), (360, 450)],  # Wednesday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-16:30\n        3: [(90, 150), (180, 210), (360, 390), (450, 480)],  # Thursday: 10:30-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:30-17:00\n        4: [(0, 90), (120, 180), (210, 330), (390, 420), (450, 480)]  # Friday: 9:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 12:30-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n    }\n    \n    # Add constraints for Bryan's busy slots\n    for d in bryan_busy:\n        add_busy_slots(d, bryan_busy[d])\n    \n    # Add constraints for Nicholas's busy slots\n    for d in nicholas_busy:\n        add_busy_slots(d, nicholas_busy[d])\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        day_val = model[day].as_long()\n        start_val = model[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = model[end_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert day_val to day name\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n        day_name = days[day_val]\n        \n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = 9 + start_val // 60\n        start_mm = start_val % 60\n        end_hh = 9 + end_val // 60\n        end_mm = end_val % 60\n        \n        # Format as two-digit strings\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_schedule()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: The variables `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are defined. The constraints ensure the meeting is within work hours (9:00 to 17:00), lasts exactly one hour, and avoids days Bryan and Nicholas prefer not to meet.\n2. **Busy Slots Handling**: The `add_busy_slots` function adds constraints to prevent the meeting from overlapping with existing meetings for Bryan and Nicholas on each day. The busy slots are converted into minutes from 9:00 AM for easier arithmetic.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If Z3 finds a solution, the day, start time, and end time are converted from numerical values back into human-readable formats (day names and HH:MM times). The solution is printed in the specified format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities to handle the complex interplay of schedules and preferences."
