You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amy and Pamela for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nAmy is busy on Wednesday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00; \nPamela is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nPamela would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday before 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting, then setting constraints based on the participants' busy schedules and preferences. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the meeting day (encoded as an integer), start time (in minutes since 9:00 AM), and duration (fixed at 30 minutes).\n2. **Constraints Setup**:\n   - **Day Constraints**: The meeting must be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n   - **Time Constraints**: The meeting must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - **Busy Times**: The meeting must not overlap with any busy slots of Amy or Pamela.\n   - **Preferences**: Pamela prefers to avoid meetings on Monday and before 16:00 on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n3. **Check for Solutions**: Use Z3 to find a solution that satisfies all constraints. If found, convert the solution into the required output format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_schedule():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 0 is 9:00, 60 is 10:00)\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    end_time = start_time + duration\n    \n    # Possible days: Monday (0), Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2)\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 2)\n    \n    # Meeting must be within 9:00-17:00 (work hours)\n    s.add(start_time >= 0, end_time <= 8 * 60)  # 8 hours from 9:00 to 17:00 is 8*60 minutes\n    \n    # Amy's busy times per day (in minutes from 9:00)\n    amy_busy = {\n        0: [],  # Monday: no busy times\n        1: [],   # Tuesday: no busy times\n        2: [(120, 150), (270, 300)]  # Wednesday: 11:00-11:30 (120-150), 13:30-14:00 (270-300)\n    }\n    \n    # Pamela's busy times per day (in minutes from 9:00)\n    pamela_busy = {\n        0: [(0, 90), (120, 450)],  # Monday: 9:00-10:30 (0-90), 11:00-16:30 (120-450)\n        1: [(0, 30), (60, 480)],   # Tuesday: 9:00-9:30 (0-30), 10:00-17:00 (60-480)\n        2: [(0, 30), (60, 120), (150, 270), (330, 360), (420, 450)]  # Wednesday: 9:00-9:30 (0-30), 10:00-11:00 (60-120), 11:30-13:30 (150-270), 14:30-15:00 (330-360), 16:00-16:30 (420-450)\n    }\n    \n    # Function to check if the meeting overlaps with any busy intervals\n    def no_overlap(day_val, start, end, busy_intervals):\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_intervals:\n            # Check if the meeting overlaps with this busy interval\n            s.add(Not(And(start < busy_end, end > busy_start)))\n    \n    # Constraints for each possible day\n    for d in [0, 1, 2]:\n        # If the meeting is on day d, then it must not overlap with Amy's and Pamela's busy times\n        s.add(Implies(day == d, And(\n            # Check Amy's busy times\n            Not(Or([And(start_time < busy_end, end_time > busy_start) for (busy_start, busy_end) in amy_busy[d]])),\n            # Check Pamela's busy times\n            Not(Or([And(start_time < busy_end, end_time > busy_start) for (busy_start, busy_end) in pamela_busy[d]]))\n        ))\n    \n    # Pamela's preferences: avoid Monday and before 16:00 on Tuesday and Wednesday\n    s.add(Not(day == 0))  # not Monday\n    s.add(Or(\n        day == 1,  # Tuesday: must be after 16:00 (420 minutes from 9:00)\n        And(day == 2, start_time >= 420)  # Wednesday: must start at or after 16:00\n    ))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_min = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert day_val to day name\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_name = days[day_val]\n        \n        # Convert start_min to HH:MM\n        start_hour = 9 + start_min // 60\n        start_minute = start_min % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_min = start_min + duration\n        end_hour = 9 + end_min // 60\n        end_minute = end_min % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        # Print the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_schedule()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The variables `day` and `start_time` are defined with constraints to ensure the meeting occurs on valid days and within working hours.\n2. **Busy Times Handling**: For each day, the solver checks that the meeting does not overlap with the participants' busy intervals.\n3. **Preferences Handling**: Additional constraints ensure Pamela's preferences are respected (no meetings on Monday and before 16:00 on Tuesday and Wednesday).\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the model values are converted into the required day and time format for output.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down possible meeting times using logical constraints, ensuring the solution meets all given conditions."
