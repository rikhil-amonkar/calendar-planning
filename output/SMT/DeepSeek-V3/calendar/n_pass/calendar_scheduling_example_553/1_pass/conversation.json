You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Eric and Henry for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nEric has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00; \nHenry has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nHenry would rather not meet on Monday after 10:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a time slot that meets all the constraints. The approach involves defining the possible time slots within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00), checking against the blocked times of both participants, and incorporating Henry's preference to not meet after 10:00 if possible. Here's the Python code using Z3:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Define the work hours and meeting duration\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60    # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Define the blocked times for Eric and Henry in minutes since 9:00\n    # Eric's blocked times: 12:00-13:00, 14:00-15:00\n    eric_blocked = [(12*60, 13*60), (14*60, 15*60)]\n    # Henry's blocked times: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-17:00\n    henry_blocked = [(9*60 + 30, 10*60), (10*60 + 30, 11*60), (11*60 + 30, 12*60 + 30),\n                     (13*60, 13*60 + 30), (14*60 + 30, 15*60), (16*60, 17*60)]\n\n    # Create a Z3 solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the start time of the meeting as an integer variable\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Add constraints for Eric's availability\n    for (block_start, block_end) in eric_blocked:\n        s.add(Or(start_time + meeting_duration <= block_start, start_time >= block_end))\n\n    # Add constraints for Henry's availability\n    for (block_start, block_end) in henry_blocked:\n        s.add(Or(start_time + meeting_duration <= block_start, start_time >= block_end))\n\n    # Henry's preference: try to schedule before 10:00 if possible\n    preferred_start = Int('preferred_start')\n    s.add(preferred_start == start_time)\n    s.add_soft(preferred_start + meeting_duration <= 10 * 60)\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start = m[start_time].as_long()\n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = start // 60\n        start_mm = start % 60\n        end = start + meeting_duration\n        end_hh = end // 60\n        end_mm = end % 60\n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Work Hours and Duration**: The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00, and the meeting duration is 30 minutes.\n2. **Blocked Times**: Convert each participant's blocked times into minutes since 9:00 for easier arithmetic.\n3. **Z3 Solver**: Use the solver to find a start time (`start_time`) that fits within the work hours and doesn't overlap with any blocked times.\n4. **Constraints**: For each blocked period, ensure the meeting doesn't overlap by requiring the meeting to either end before the block starts or start after the block ends.\n5. **Preference**: Henry prefers meetings before 10:00, so we add a soft constraint to prioritize earlier times.\n6. **Output**: If a solution is found, convert the start and end times back to HH:MM format and print the result.\n\nThis code will output the earliest possible meeting time that fits all constraints, prioritizing Henry's preference for a meeting before 10:00."
