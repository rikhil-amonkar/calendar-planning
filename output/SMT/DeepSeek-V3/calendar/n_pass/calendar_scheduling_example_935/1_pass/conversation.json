You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Terry and Frances for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nTerry is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Friday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nFrances has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 11:00 to 12:30, 14:30 to 17:00, Friday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFrances would like to avoid more meetings on Tuesday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find the earliest possible time slot that fits all the given constraints. The approach involves encoding the availability of both participants, their busy times, and preferences into logical constraints that Z3 can solve.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day will be represented as an integer (0 to 4 for Monday to Friday), and the start and end times will be in minutes since 9:00 AM (work hours start at 9:00).\n2. **Constraints for Meeting Duration**: The meeting duration must be exactly 30 minutes, so the end time is the start time plus 30 minutes.\n3. **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must be scheduled between 9:00 and 17:00 (i.e., start time between 0 and 480 minutes, since 17:00 is 8 hours after 9:00).\n4. **Busy Times Constraint**: For each participant, we'll add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with any of their busy time slots. This involves checking that the meeting time does not fall within any of the blocked intervals for both Terry and Frances.\n5. **Preference Constraint**: Frances prefers to avoid more meetings on Tuesday, so we'll add a constraint that the day is not Tuesday unless no other day is available. However, since we are to find the earliest possible time, we'll prioritize days in order from Monday to Friday, checking the earliest available slot first.\n6. **Solve and Extract Solution**: The solver will find a model that satisfies all constraints. We'll then convert the model's values back into day names and time formats.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, ..., 4: Friday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 0 is 9:00, 30 is 9:30, etc.)\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    end_time = start_time + meeting_duration\n\n    # Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (480 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 4)\n    s.add(start_time >= 0, end_time <= 480)\n\n    # Terry's busy times per day (each entry is (day, start, end) in minutes from 9:00)\n    terry_busy = [\n        # Monday\n        (0, 10*60 + 30 -
