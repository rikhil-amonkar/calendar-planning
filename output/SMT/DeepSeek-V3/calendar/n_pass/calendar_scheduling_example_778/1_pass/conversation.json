You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Susan and Sandra for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nSusan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:30; \nSandra has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00; \n\nSusan would rather not meet on Tuesday. Sandra can not meet on Monday after 16:00. Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a time slot that meets all the given constraints. The approach involves encoding the availability of both participants, their preferences, and the meeting duration into logical constraints that Z3 can solve.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day will be represented as an integer (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, 2 for Wednesday), and the start and end times will be in minutes since 9:00 AM (the start of the workday).\n2. **Constraints for Meeting Duration**: The meeting duration must be exactly 30 minutes, so the end time should be exactly 30 minutes after the start time.\n3. **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must occur between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM (i.e., start time \u2265 0 minutes and end time \u2264 480 minutes (8 hours * 60 minutes)).\n4. **Participant Availability**: For each participant, their existing schedule blocks certain time slots. The meeting must not overlap with any of these blocked slots.\n5. **Preferences**: Susan prefers not to meet on Tuesday, and Sandra cannot meet on Monday after 16:00. These preferences will be encoded as additional constraints.\n6. **Solve and Extract Solution**: Use Z3 to solve the constraints and then convert the solution back into the desired day and time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_schedule():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 0 is 9:00, 30 is 9:30)\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    s.add(end_time == start_time + 30)\n\n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (480 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(start_time >= 0)\n    s.add(end_time <= 480)\n\n    # Day must be 0, 1, or 2 (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday)\n    s.add(day >= 0)\n    s.add(day <= 2)\n\n    # Susan's blocked times\n    # Convert each blocked time to (day, start_min, end_min) tuples\n    susan_blocked = [\n        (0, 12*60 + 30 - 9*60, 13*60 - 9*60),  # Monday 12:30-13:00 (210-240 mins)\n        (0, 13*60 + 30 - 9*60, 14*60 - 9*60),  # Monday 13:30-14:00 (270-300 mins)\n        (1, 11*60 + 30 - 9*60, 12*60 - 9*60),  # Tuesday 11:30-12:00 (150-180 mins)\n        (2, 9*60 + 30 - 9*60, 10*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Wednesday 9:30-10:30 (30-90 mins)\n        (2, 14*60 - 9*60, 14*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Wednesday 14:00-14:30 (300-330 mins)\n        (2, 15*60 + 30 - 9*60, 16*60 + 30 - 9*60)  # Wednesday 15:30-16:30 (390-450 mins)\n    ]\n\n    # Sandra's blocked times\n    sandra_blocked = [\n        (0, 0, 13*60 - 9*60),  # Monday 9:00-13:00 (0-240 mins)\n        (0, 14*60 - 9*60, 15*60 - 9*60),  # Monday 14:00-15:00 (300-360 mins)\n        (0, 16*60 - 9*60, 16*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Monday 16:00-16:30 (420-450 mins)\n        (1, 0, 9*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Tuesday 9:00-9:30 (0-30 mins)\n        (1, 10*60 + 30 - 9*60, 12*60 - 9*60),  # Tuesday 10:30-12:00 (90-180 mins)\n        (1, 12*60 + 30 - 9*60, 13*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Tuesday 12:30-13:30 (210-270 mins)\n        (1, 14*60 - 9*60, 14*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Tuesday 14:00-14:30 (300-330 mins)\n        (1, 16*60 - 9*60, 17*60 - 9*60),  # Tuesday 16:00-17:00 (420-480 mins)\n        (2, 0, 11*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Wednesday 9:00-11:30 (0-150 mins)\n        (2, 12*60 - 9*60, 12*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Wednesday 12:00-12:30 (180-210 mins)\n        (2, 13*60 - 9*60, 17*60 - 9*60)  # Wednesday 13:00-17:00 (240-480 mins)\n    ]\n\n    # Function to add no overlap constraints for a list of blocked times\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(blocked_times):\n        for (b_day, b_start, b_end) in blocked_times:\n            s.add(Not(And(\n                day == b_day,\n                start_time < b_end,\n                end_time > b_start\n            )))\n\n    # Add constraints for Susan and Sandra's blocked times\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(susan_blocked)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(sandra_blocked)\n\n    # Susan would rather not meet on Tuesday (day 1)\n    s.add(day != 1)\n\n    # Sandra cannot meet on Monday after 16:00 (420 minutes from 9:00 is 16:00)\n    # So on Monday (day 0), the meeting must end by 16:00 (420 minutes)\n    s.add(Implies(day == 0, end_time <= 420))\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        day_val = model[day].as_long()\n        start_val = model[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = model[end_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert day_val to day name\n        days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']\n        day_name = days[day_val]\n\n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = 9 + start_val // 60\n        start_min = start_val % 60\n        end_hour = 9 + end_val // 60\n        end_min = end_val % 60\n\n        # Format as strings\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_min:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_min:02d}\"\n\n        # Print the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_schedule()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The variables `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are defined to represent the meeting day and times. Constraints ensure the meeting duration is 30 minutes and within work hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM).\n2. **Blocked Times**: Each participant's blocked times are converted into intervals in minutes from 9:00 AM. The solver ensures the meeting does not overlap with any blocked intervals.\n3. **Preferences**: Susan's preference to avoid Tuesday and Sandra's constraint on Monday after 16:00 are added as additional constraints.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the solver outputs the day and time in the required format. The day is converted from an integer to a string, and the start and end times are formatted from minutes into HH:MM.\n\nThis approach efficiently encodes the problem into logical constraints that Z3 can solve, ensuring all conditions are met for an optimal meeting time."
