You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Lisa, Bobby and Randy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nLisa has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nBobby is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nRandy has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nBobby would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the meeting start time and ensuring that the chosen time slot doesn't overlap with any of the participants' existing meetings while respecting Bobby's preference to avoid meetings after 15:00.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert all time slots into minutes from the start of the day (9:00 AM) for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Define Variables**: Use Z3 integer variables to represent the start time of the meeting in minutes.\n3. **Set Constraints**: \n   - The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so the end time is start time + 30.\n   - The meeting must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00, i.e., 0 to 480 minutes from 9:00).\n   - The meeting should not overlap with any of the participants' busy slots.\n   - Bobby's preference to avoid meetings after 15:00 (360 minutes from 9:00) translates to the end time being before or at 15:00.\n4. **Check for Solutions**: Use the Z3 solver to find a valid start time that meets all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time variable in minutes from 9:00 (0 minutes is 9:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    duration = 30  # meeting duration in minutes\n    \n    # Total working hours: 9:00 to 17:00 is 8 hours = 480 minutes\n    max_time = 480\n    \n    # Constraint: start_time must be >= 0 (9:00) and end_time <= 480 (17:00)\n    end_time = start_time + duration\n    solver.add(start_time >= 0)\n    solver.add(end_time <= max_time)\n    \n    # Define each participant's busy slots in minutes from 9:00\n    # Lisa's busy slots\n    lisa_busy = [\n        (0, 60),      # 9:00-10:00\n        (90, 150),     # 10:30-11:30\n        (210, 240),    # 12:30-13:00\n        (420, 450)     # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n    \n    # Bobby's busy slots\n    bobby_busy = [\n        (0, 30),       # 9:00-9:30\n        (60, 90),       # 10:00-10:30\n        (150, 180),     # 11:30-12:00\n        (360, 390)      # 15:00-15:30\n    ]\n    # Bobby's preference: meeting should end by 15:00 (360 minutes)\n    solver.add(end_time <= 360)\n    \n    # Randy's busy slots\n    randy_busy = [\n        (30, 60),      # 9:30-10:00\n        (90, 120),     # 10:30-11:00\n        (150, 210),    # 11:30-12:30\n        (240, 270),    # 13:00-13:30\n        (330, 390),    # 14:30-15:30\n        (420, 450)     # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n    \n    # Function to add no overlap constraints for a participant's busy slots\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(busy_slots):\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_slots:\n            # The meeting must not overlap with this busy slot\n            solver.add(Or(\n                end_time <= busy_start,\n                start_time >= busy_end\n            ))\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(lisa_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(bobby_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(randy_busy)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_min = model[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_min back to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = 9 + start_min // 60\n        start_minute = start_min % 60\n        end_min = start_min + duration\n        end_hour = 9 + end_min // 60\n        end_minute = end_min % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables and Constraints**: The start time of the meeting is defined as an integer variable in minutes from 9:00 AM. The constraints ensure the meeting fits within working hours (9:00 to 17:00) and does not overlap with any participant's busy slots.\n3. **Busy Slots Handling**: Each participant's busy slots are converted into minutes from 9:00 AM. The solver ensures the meeting does not overlap with any of these slots by adding constraints that the meeting must either end before a busy slot starts or start after it ends.\n4. **Bobby's Preference**: An additional constraint is added to ensure the meeting ends by 15:00 (360 minutes from 9:00 AM).\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start and end times are converted back to HH:MM format and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint satisfaction, ensuring all participants' schedules and preferences are respected."
