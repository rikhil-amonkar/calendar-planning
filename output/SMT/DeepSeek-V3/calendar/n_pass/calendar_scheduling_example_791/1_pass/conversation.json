You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Nicole and Ruth for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nNicole is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \nRuth has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nRuth do not want to meet on Wednesday after 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we can use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting, and then adding constraints based on the participants' busy schedules and preferences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables to represent the day of the meeting (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday), the start time, and the end time. The start and end times should be in minutes since midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Day Constraints**: The meeting must be on one of the specified days (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday).\n   - **Duration Constraint**: The meeting duration must be exactly 30 minutes (end time - start time = 30).\n   - **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must be within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes).\n   - **Participants' Busy Slots**: The meeting should not overlap with any of the busy slots of Nicole or Ruth.\n   - **Ruth's Preference**: Ruth does not want to meet on Wednesday after 13:30 (810 minutes).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes since midnight\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n\n    # Day constraints: day must be 0, 1, or 2\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1, day == 2))\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    s.add(end_time == start_time + 30)\n\n    # Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540)\n    s.add(end_time <= 1020)\n\n    # Nicole's busy slots\n    # Monday: 9:00-9:30 (540-570), 13:00-13:30 (780-810), 14:30-15:30 (870-930)\n    # Tuesday: 9:00-9:30 (540-570), 11:30-13:30 (690-810), 14:30-15:30 (870-930)\n    # Wednesday: 10:00-11:00 (600-660), 12:30-15:00 (750-900), 16:00-17:00 (960-1020)\n    # For Nicole, the meeting must not overlap with any of these slots\n    nicole_busy = [\n        (0, 540, 570), (0, 780, 810), (0, 870, 930),\n        (1, 540, 570), (1, 690, 810), (1, 870, 930),\n        (2, 600, 660), (2, 750, 900), (2, 960, 1020)\n    ]\n    for (d, busy_start, busy_end) in nicole_busy:\n        s.add(Not(And(day == d,\n                      Or(And(start_time >= busy_start, start_time < busy_end),\n                         And(end_time > busy_start, end_time <= busy_end),\n                         And(start_time <= busy_start, end_time >= busy_end)))))\n\n    # Ruth's busy slots\n    # Monday: 9:00-17:00 (540-1020)\n    # Tuesday: 9:00-17:00 (540-1020)\n    # Wednesday: 9:00-10:30 (540-630), 11:00-11:30 (660-690), 12:00-12:30 (720-750), 13:30-15:30 (810-930), 16:00-16:30 (960-990)\n    # Also, Ruth doesn't want to meet on Wednesday after 13:30 (810 minutes)\n    ruth_busy = [\n        (0, 540, 1020),\n        (1, 540, 1020),\n        (2, 540, 630), (2, 660, 690), (2, 720, 750), (2, 810, 930), (2, 960, 990)\n    ]\n    for (d, busy_start, busy_end) in ruth_busy:\n        s.add(Not(And(day == d,\n                      Or(And(start_time >= busy_start, start_time < busy_end),\n                         And(end_time > busy_start, end_time <= busy_end),\n                         And(start_time <= busy_start, end_time >= busy_end)))))\n    # Additional constraint: Ruth doesn't want to meet on Wednesday after 13:30 (810 minutes)\n    s.add(Not(And(day == 2, start_time >= 810)))\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n        end_val = m[end_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert day to string\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_str = days[day_val]\n\n        # Convert start and end times to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = start_val // 60\n        start_mm = start_val % 60\n        end_hh = end_val // 60\n        end_mm = end_val % 60\n\n        # Format the output\n        solution = f\"SOLUTION:\\nDay: {day_str}\\nStart Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\\nEnd Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        print(solution)\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: The variables `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are defined. The `day` variable can take values 0 (Monday), 1 (Tuesday), or 2 (Wednesday). The start and end times are in minutes since midnight for easier arithmetic.\n2. **Day and Duration Constraints**: The meeting must be on one of the specified days, and the duration must be exactly 30 minutes.\n3. **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must start and end within the 9:00 to 17:00 window (540 to 1020 minutes).\n4. **Busy Slots Handling**: For each participant, their busy slots are converted into constraints that ensure the meeting does not overlap with these slots. For Ruth, an additional constraint ensures the meeting on Wednesday does not start after 13:30 (810 minutes).\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the model values for day, start time, and end time are converted into a readable format and printed.\n\nThis approach systematically checks all possible meeting times against the given constraints to find a feasible slot that works for both participants."
