You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Evelyn and Randy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nEvelynhas no meetings the whole day.\nRandy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nEvelyn do not want to meet on Monday after 13:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

The constraints include the participants' existing schedules and Evelyn's preference not to meet after 13:00 on Monday. \n\nHere's the Python code using Z3:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the work hours (9:00 to 17:00)\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n\n    # Possible start times for the meeting (in minutes from 0:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Evelyn has no meetings, but doesn't want to meet after 13:00\n    evelyn_constraint = (start_time + meeting_duration <= 13 * 60)\n    s.add(evelyn_constraint)\n\n    # Randy's busy times (in minutes from 0:00)\n    randy_busy = [\n        (9 * 60, 10 * 60 + 30),   # 9:00 to 10:30\n        (11 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30),  # 11:00 to 15:30\n        (16 * 60, 17 * 60)        # 16:00 to 17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with Randy's busy times\n    for busy_start, busy_end in randy_busy:\n        s.add(Or(\n            start_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start,\n            start_time >= busy_end\n        ))\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_min = m[start_time].as_long()\n        start_hour = start_min // 60\n        start_min = start_min % 60\n        end_min = start_min + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = start_hour + (end_min // 60)\n        end_min = end_min % 60\n\n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_min:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_min:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Work Hours and Meeting Duration**: The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00, and the meeting duration is 30 minutes.\n2. **Evelyn's Constraint**: She doesn't want to meet after 13:00, so the meeting must end by 13:00.\n3. **Randy's Busy Times**: Randy has three busy blocks during the day. The meeting must not overlap with these.\n4. **Z3 Solver**: The solver checks for a start time that satisfies all constraints (within work hours, not overlapping with Randy's busy times, and ending by 13:00 for Evelyn).\n5. **Output**: If a solution is found, it prints the day, start time, and end time in the required format.\n\nThe solution will output the earliest valid time slot that meets all constraints. In this case, the only valid time is from 10:30 to 11:00 on Monday."
