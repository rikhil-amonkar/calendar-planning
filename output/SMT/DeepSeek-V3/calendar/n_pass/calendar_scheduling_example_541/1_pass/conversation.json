You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kayla and Rebecca for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKayla has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 14:30 to 16:00; \nRebecca has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we can use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining the available time slots for each participant and then finding a one-hour slot where both participants are free.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Work Hours**: The meeting must be scheduled between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday.\n2. **Model Blocked Times**: Convert each participant's blocked times into intervals where they are unavailable.\n3. **Find Available Slots**: For each participant, determine the intervals where they are free. The meeting must be scheduled in a one-hour slot that is free for both participants.\n4. **Use Z3 to Find a Valid Slot**: Use Z3 to find a start time such that the one-hour duration from this start time does not overlap with any blocked intervals of either participant.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60    # 17:00 in minutes\n    \n    # Define the blocked times for each participant in minutes since midnight\n    kayla_blocked = [\n        (10 * 60, 10 * 60 + 30),   # 10:00-10:30\n        (14 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60)     # 14:30-16:00\n    ]\n    \n    rebecca_blocked = [\n        (9 * 60, 13 * 60),          # 9:00-13:00\n        (13 * 60 + 30, 15 * 60),     # 13:30-15:00\n        (15 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60)      # 15:30-16:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a Z3 solver instance\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # The meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes)\n    meeting_duration = 60\n    \n    # The start time of the meeting in minutes since midnight\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Constraints: start_time must be within work hours and the meeting must end within work hours\n    solver.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    solver.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n    \n    # Function to check if a time interval overlaps with any blocked intervals\n    def no_overlap(start, duration, blocked_intervals):\n        conditions = []\n        for (block_start, block_end) in blocked_intervals:\n            # The meeting interval does not overlap with the blocked interval\n            conditions.append(Or(\n                start + duration <= block_start,\n                start >= block_end\n            ))\n        return And(conditions)\n    \n    # Add constraints for Kayla's blocked times\n    solver.add(no_overlap(start_time, meeting_duration, kayla_blocked))\n    \n    # Add constraints for Rebecca's blocked times\n    solver.add(no_overlap(start_time, meeting_duration, rebecca_blocked))\n    \n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model.eval(start_time).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = start_minutes // 60\n        start_minute = start_minutes % 60\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Work Hours and Blocked Times**: The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00. Each participant's blocked times are converted into minute intervals for easier calculation.\n2. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The Z3 solver is initialized to find a start time (`start_time`) for the meeting.\n3. **Constraints**: The start time must be within work hours, and the meeting must end before 17:00. The `no_overlap` function ensures the meeting does not overlap with any blocked intervals for either participant.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a valid start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format and printed along with the end time (start time + 1 hour).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the available time slots by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring the meeting is scheduled at a time convenient for all participants."
