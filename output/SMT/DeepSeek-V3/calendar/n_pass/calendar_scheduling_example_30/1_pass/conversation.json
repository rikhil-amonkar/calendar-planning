You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jeffrey, Virginia and Melissa for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJeffrey has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00; \nVirginia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMelissa is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nMelissa would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a time slot that meets all the given constraints. The approach involves defining the possible time slots within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and ensuring the selected slot doesn't conflict with any participant's existing meetings. Additionally, we'll account for Melissa's preference to not meet after 14:00.\n\nHere's the Python code using the Z3 solver:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling_problem():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) in minutes from 0 (9:00) to 480 (17:00)\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # 30 minutes\n\n    # Define the possible start times (in minutes) for the meeting\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(start_time <= work_end - meeting_duration)\n\n    # Convert each participant's busy times to minutes from 0 (9:00)\n    jeffrey_busy = [\n        (9*60 + 30, 10*60),    # 9:30-10:00\n        (10*60 + 30, 11*60)     # 10:30-11:00\n    ]\n    virginia_busy = [\n        (9*60, 9*60 + 30),      # 9:00-9:30\n        (10*60, 10*60 + 30),     # 10:00-10:30\n        (14*60 + 30, 15*60),     # 14:30-15:00\n        (16*60, 16*60 + 30)      # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n    melissa_busy = [\n        (9*60, 11*60 + 30),     # 9:00-11:30\n        (12*60, 12*60 + 30),     # 12:00-12:30\n        (13*60, 15*60),          # 13:00-15:00\n        (16*60, 17*60)           # 16:00-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Function to check if the meeting time overlaps with any busy time\n    def no_overlap(start, busy_times):\n        return And([Or(start + meeting_duration <= busy_start, start >= busy_end) \n                   for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_times])\n\n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    s.add(no_overlap(start_time, jeffrey_busy))\n    s.add(no_overlap(start_time, virginia_busy))\n    s.add(no_overlap(start_time, melissa_busy))\n\n    # Melissa's preference: meeting should not start after 14:00\n    s.add(start_time <= 14 * 60)\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_minutes = m[start_time].as_long()\n        start_hour = start_minutes // 60\n        start_minute = start_minutes % 60\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n\n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling_problem()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Work Hours and Meeting Duration**: The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00, and the meeting duration is 30 minutes. We represent time in minutes from 0 (9:00) to 480 (17:00).\n2. **Busy Times**: Each participant's busy times are converted into minutes from 9:00. For example, 9:30-10:00 becomes (570, 600) in minutes.\n3. **No Overlap Constraint**: The function `no_overlap` ensures the meeting time does not overlap with any of the participant's busy times.\n4. **Melissa's Preference**: The constraint `start_time <= 14 * 60` ensures the meeting starts before or at 14:00.\n5. **Z3 Solver**: The solver checks for a valid start time that satisfies all constraints. If found, it converts the start time back to HH:MM format and prints the solution.\n\nThe output will be the first valid time slot that meets all constraints, formatted as specified."
