You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Julie, Sean and Lori for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJulie has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \nSean has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nLori is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints that ensure the meeting time doesn't overlap with any of the participants' busy slots and fits within the work hours. Here's the Python code that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Define the work hours\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60    # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 60  # 1 hour in minutes\n\n    # Participants' busy slots in minutes since midnight\n    julie_busy = [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (11*60, 11*60 + 30), (12*60, 12*60 + 30), \n                  (13*60 + 30, 14*60), (16*60, 17*60)]\n    sean_busy = [(9*60, 9*60 + 30), (13*60, 13*60 + 30), (15*60, 15*60 + 30), \n                 (16*60, 16*60 + 30)]\n    lori_busy = [(10*60, 10*60 + 30), (11*60, 13*60), (15*60 + 30, 17*60)]\n\n    # Create a Z3 solver instance\n    solver = Solver()\n\n    # Define the meeting start time as a Z3 variable\n    meeting_start = Int('meeting_start')\n    \n    # Constraint: meeting must start within work hours and end before work ends\n    solver.add(meeting_start >= work_start)\n    solver.add(meeting_start + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Function to add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with busy slots\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(busy_slots):\n        for start, end in busy_slots:\n            solver.add(Or(meeting_start + meeting_duration <= start, meeting_start >= end))\n\n    # Add no-overlap constraints for each participant\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(julie_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(sean_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(lori_busy)\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model[meeting_start].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = start_minutes // 60\n        start_mm = start_minutes % 60\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hh = end_minutes // 60\n        end_mm = end_minutes % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        solution = (\n            f\"SOLUTION:\\n\"\n            f\"Day: Monday\\n\"\n            f\"Start Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\\n\"\n            f\"End Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        )\n        return solution\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found.\"\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(find_meeting_time())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Work Hours and Meeting Duration**: The work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00 (9 AM to 5 PM), and the meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes).\n2. **Busy Slots**: Each participant's busy slots are converted into minutes since midnight for easier arithmetic.\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver is initialized, and the meeting start time is defined as an integer variable.\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start and end within work hours.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of the participants' busy slots. This is ensured by adding constraints that the meeting either ends before a busy slot starts or starts after it ends.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the meeting start time is converted back to HH:MM format, and the end time is calculated by adding the duration.\n6. **Output**: The solution is formatted as specified, showing the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds a meeting time that satisfies all constraints using the Z3 solver."
