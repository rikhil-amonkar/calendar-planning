You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Tyler, Kelly, Stephanie, Hannah, Joe, Diana and Deborah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nTyler is free the entire day.\nKellyhas no meetings the whole day.\nStephanie has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nHannahhas no meetings the whole day.\nJoe has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 17:00; \nDiana has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nDeborah is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a time slot that fits everyone's schedule. The approach involves encoding each participant's availability constraints and then finding a 30-minute window where all participants are free.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the start time of the meeting. The meeting duration is fixed at 30 minutes, so the end time will be start time + 30 minutes.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: For each participant, we'll add constraints that the meeting time does not overlap with any of their blocked time slots. This means the meeting must either start before or after each blocked interval.\n3. **Solve the Model**: The Z3 solver will check for a start time that satisfies all constraints within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_schedule():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time as an integer (minutes from 9:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    \n    # Total working hours from 9:00 to 17:00 is 8 hours = 480 minutes\n    # So start_time must be between 0 and 450 (since 450 + 30 = 480)\n    s.add(start_time >= 0)\n    s.add(start_time <= 450)\n    \n    # Define each person's busy slots in minutes from 9:00\n    # Each slot is a tuple (start, end)\n    \n    # Stephanie's busy slots: 11:00-11:30 (120-150), 14:30-15:00 (330-360)\n    stephanie_busy = [(120, 150), (330, 360)]\n    \n    # Joe's busy slots: 9:00-9:30 (0-30), 10:00-12:00 (60-180), 12:30-13:00 (210-240), 14:00-17:00 (300-480)\n    joe_busy = [(0, 30), (60, 180), (210, 240), (300, 480)]\n    \n    # Diana's busy slots: 9:00-10:30 (0-90), 11:30-12:00 (150-180), 13:00-14:00 (240-300), 14:30-15:30 (330-390), 16:00-17:00 (420-480)\n    diana_busy = [(0, 90), (150, 180), (240, 300), (330, 390), (420, 480)]\n    \n    # Deborah's busy slots: 9:00-10:00 (0-60), 10:30-12:00 (90-180), 12:30-13:00 (210-240), 13:30-14:00 (270-300), 14:30-15:30 (330-390), 16:00-16:30 (420-450)\n    deborah_busy = [(0, 60), (90, 180), (210, 240), (270, 300), (330, 390), (420, 450)]\n    \n    # For each person, add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with any of their busy slots\n    # The meeting is from start_time to start_time + duration\n    # For a busy slot (busy_start, busy_end), the meeting must either:\n    #   end before busy_start OR start after busy_end\n    \n    # Stephanie's constraints\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in stephanie_busy:\n        s.add(Or(start_time + duration <= busy_start, start_time >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Joe's constraints\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in joe_busy:\n        s.add(Or(start_time + duration <= busy_start, start_time >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Diana's constraints\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in diana_busy:\n        s.add(Or(start_time + duration <= busy_start, start_time >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Deborah's constraints\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in deborah_busy:\n        s.add(Or(start_time + duration <= busy_start, start_time >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_minutes = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes back to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        start_minute = start_minutes % 60\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + duration\n        end_hour = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_schedule()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables and Constraints**: The start time is represented as an integer (minutes from 9:00). Constraints ensure the meeting fits within working hours (9:00-17:00) and does not overlap with any participant's busy slots.\n3. **Busy Slots Handling**: For each participant, their busy slots are converted into minutes from 9:00. The solver checks that the meeting either starts after or ends before each busy slot.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start time in minutes is converted back to a 24-hour format, and the meeting's start and end times are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible time slots within the working hours, ensuring the meeting fits everyone's schedule without overlaps. The Z3 solver handles the complex constraint satisfaction problem, providing an optimal solution when one exists."
