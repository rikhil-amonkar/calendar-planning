You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michael, Eric and Arthur for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMichael has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nEric's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nArthur has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the participants' schedules as constraints and finding a time slot that satisfies all constraints for the meeting.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We will define variables for the start and end times of the meeting. These times will be constrained to the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n2. **Model Constraints**: For each participant, we will add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with their existing meetings. This involves ensuring the meeting time is either before or after each blocked interval in their schedule.\n3. **Solve Constraints**: Using Z3, we will solve these constraints to find a feasible start and end time for the meeting that does not conflict with any participant's schedule.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define work hours\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60    # 17:00 in minutes\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    \n    # Variables for meeting start and end times (in minutes since midnight)\n    start = Int('start')\n    end = Int('end')\n    \n    # Constraints for work hours and duration\n    s.add(start >= work_start)\n    s.add(end <= work_end)\n    s.add(end == start + duration)\n    \n    # Michael's busy slots (in minutes since midnight)\n    michael_busy = [\n        (9 * 60 + 30, 10 * 60 + 30),  # 9:30-10:30\n        (15 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30),      # 15:00-15:30\n        (16 * 60, 16 * 60 + 30)       # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n    \n    # Arthur's busy slots\n    arthur_busy = [\n        (9 * 60, 12 * 60),            # 9:00-12:00\n        (13 * 60, 15 * 60),           # 13:00-15:00\n        (15 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60),      # 15:30-16:00\n        (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)       # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Eric's calendar is open, no constraints\n    \n    # Add constraints for Michael's busy times\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in michael_busy:\n        s.add(Or(end <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Add constraints for Arthur's busy times\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in arthur_busy:\n        s.add(Or(end <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_min = model.eval(start).as_long()\n        end_min = model.eval(end).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        start_hh = start_min // 60\n        start_mm = start_min % 60\n        end_hh = end_min // 60\n        end_mm = end_min % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        solution = (\n            f\"SOLUTION:\\n\"\n            f\"Day: Monday\\n\"\n            f\"Start Time: {start_hh:02d}:{start_mm:02d}\\n\"\n            f\"End Time: {end_hh:02d}:{end_mm:02d}\"\n        )\n        print(solution)\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found.\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: The variables `start` and `end` represent the meeting's start and end times in minutes since midnight. The constraints ensure the meeting fits within the 9:00 to 17:00 window and lasts exactly 30 minutes.\n2. **Busy Slots Handling**: For each participant's busy slots, constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap. This is done by requiring the meeting to either end before the busy slot starts or start after the busy slot ends.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If Z3 finds a solution (sat), the model is queried for the start and end times. These times are converted from minutes back to a readable HH:MM format and printed in the specified output format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring the solution meets all given constraints."
