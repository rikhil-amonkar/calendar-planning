You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Lisa and Anthony for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nLisa is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 14:00 to 16:00; \nAnthony is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nYou would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we can use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the participants' busy times and finding the earliest available half-hour slot where both Lisa and Anthony are free.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model Time Slots**: Represent the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) in minutes from the start of the day (9:00 AM is 0 minutes, 5:00 PM is 480 minutes).\n2. **Busy Intervals**: Convert each participant's busy intervals into minutes from the start time (9:00 AM). For example, Lisa's busy interval from 9:00 to 9:30 becomes 0 to 30 minutes.\n3. **Find Free Intervals**: Determine the intervals where both participants are free by checking against their busy times.\n4. **Check for Earliest Slot**: Iterate through possible 30-minute slots starting from the earliest time (9:00 AM) to find the first slot where both are free.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes from 9:00 (0) to 17:00 (480)\n    work_start = 0\n    work_end = 480  # 8 hours * 60 minutes = 480 minutes (from 9:00 to 17:00)\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Busy times for Lisa and Anthony in minutes from 9:00\n    lisa_busy = [\n        (0, 30),    # 9:00-9:30\n        (90, 120),   # 10:30-11:00\n        (300, 420)   # 14:00-16:00\n    ]\n    \n    anthony_busy = [\n        (0, 30),     # 9:00-9:30\n        (120, 150),  # 11:00-11:30\n        (210, 270),  # 12:30-13:30\n        (300, 360),  # 14:00-15:00\n        (390, 420),  # 15:30-16:00\n        (450, 480)   # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Create a Z3 solver instance\n    solver = Solver()\n\n    # The meeting start time variable (in minutes from 9:00)\n    meeting_start = Int('meeting_start')\n    \n    # Constraints:\n    # 1.
