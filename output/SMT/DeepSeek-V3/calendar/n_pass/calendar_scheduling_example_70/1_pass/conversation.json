        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we can use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling each participant's availability as constraints and then finding a time slot that satisfies all constraints while meeting the group's preference for the earliest available time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables to represent the start time of the meeting. The start time will be a continuous variable in minutes from the start of the workday (9:00 AM, which is 540 minutes from midnight).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Duration**: The meeting lasts 30 minutes, so the end time is start time + 30 minutes.\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must be entirely within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00, i.e., 540 to 1020 minutes).\n   - **Participant Availability**: The meeting must not overlap with any blocked times in each participant's schedule.\n3. **Optimization**: Since the group prefers the earliest available time, we will minimize the start time variable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Define the work hours in minutes from midnight\n    work_start = 9 * 60  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 17 * 60   # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Create a solver instance\n    solver = Optimize()\n\n    # Define the start time variable (in minutes since midnight)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n\n    # Constraints for work hours: meeting must start and end within work hours\n    solver.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    solver.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Define each participant's busy times in minutes since midnight\n    # Denise's busy times: 12:00-12:30 (720-750), 15:30-16:00 (930-960)\n    denise_busy = [(12 * 60, 12 * 60 + 30), (15 * 60 + 30, 16 * 60)]\n    # Natalie's busy times: 9:00-11:30 (540-690), 12:00-13:00 (720-780), 14:00-14:30 (840-870), 15:00-17:00 (900-1020)\n    natalie_busy = [(9 * 60, 11 * 60 + 30), (12 * 60, 13 * 60), (14 * 60, 14 * 60 + 30), (15 * 60, 17 * 60)]\n    # Angela has no meetings, so no constraints\n\n    # Function to add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with any busy intervals\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(busy_intervals):\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_intervals:\n            # The meeting must be either entirely before or entirely after the busy interval\n            solver.add(Or(\n                start_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start,\n                start_time >= busy_end\n            ))\n\n    # Add constraints for Denise and Natalie\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(denise_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(natalie_busy)\n\n    # Objective: minimize the start time to find the earliest possible meeting\n    solver.minimize(start_time)\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model.eval(start_time).as_long()\n\n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        hours = start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hours = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes_remainder = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes_remainder:02d}\"\n\n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The start time of the meeting is modeled as an integer variable representing minutes from midnight. Constraints ensure the meeting fits within work hours and does not overlap with any participant's busy times.\n2. **Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are converted into minute ranges from midnight. For example, Denise's 12:00-12:30 block becomes 720-750 minutes.\n3. **Non-Overlap Constraints**: For each busy interval, constraints are added to ensure the meeting either starts after the interval ends or ends before the interval starts.\n4. **Optimization**: The solver minimizes the start time to find the earliest feasible meeting time. The solution is then converted back to a readable HH:MM format and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint solving capabilities, ensuring the earliest possible time that accommodates all participants' schedules."
