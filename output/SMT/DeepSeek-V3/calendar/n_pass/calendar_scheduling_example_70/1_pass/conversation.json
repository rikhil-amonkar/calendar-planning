        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, which is a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the participants' schedules and finding a time slot that satisfies all constraints, including the meeting duration and the earliest available time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Time Slots**: We will consider the work hours from 9:00 to 17:00 (5:00 PM) on Monday. The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so we need to find a 30-minute slot where all participants are available.\n2. **Define Constraints**: For each participant, their busy times are converted into constraints that the meeting cannot overlap with. The meeting must start at a time such that the entire 30-minute duration falls within the work hours and does not overlap with any participant's busy slots.\n3. **Find Earliest Time**: The group prefers the earliest available time. We will iterate through possible start times in chronological order and check for the first valid slot where all constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Participants' busy slots in minutes since 9:00 (540 minutes)\n    # Work hours: 9:00 (540) to 17:00 (1020)\n    work_start = 540  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 1020    # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Convert each participant's busy times to minutes since 9:00\n    denise_busy = [(720, 750), (930, 960)]  # 12:00-12:30, 15:30-16:00\n    angela_busy = []  # No meetings\n    natalie_busy = [(540, 690), (720, 780), (840, 870), (900, 1020)]  # 9:00-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-17:00\n\n    # Create a solver instance\n    solver = Solver()\n\n    # The meeting start time (in minutes since 9:00)\n    start = Int('start')\n    end = start + meeting_duration\n\n    # Constraints: start must be within work hours and end must be <= work_end\n    solver.add(start >= work_start)\n    solver.add(end <= work_end)\n\n    # Add constraints for each participant's busy times\n    # Denise's constraints: meeting must not overlap with any of her busy slots\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in denise_busy:\n        solver.add(Or(end <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Angela has no constraints, so no additions needed\n    \n    # Natalie's constraints\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in natalie_busy:\n        solver.add(Or(end <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_time_min = model[start].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_time_min back to HH:MM format\n        hours = start_time_min // 60\n        minutes = start_time_min % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_time_min = start_time_min + meeting_duration\n        end_hours = end_time_min // 60\n        end_minutes = end_time_min % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The code converts all times into minutes since 9:00 AM (540 minutes) for easier arithmetic operations. For example, 12:00 PM is 720 minutes (12 * 60).\n2. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver is initialized to find a start time (`start`) such that the meeting duration (30 minutes) does not overlap with any participant's busy times.\n3. **Constraints Handling**: For each participant's busy slots, constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap. The solver checks for the earliest valid start time within the work hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM).\n4. **Output**: Once a solution is found, the start and end times are converted back to HH:MM format and printed. The solution ensures the meeting is scheduled at the earliest possible time that fits all constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times using constraint solving, ensuring the earliest available slot is chosen while respecting all participants' schedules."
