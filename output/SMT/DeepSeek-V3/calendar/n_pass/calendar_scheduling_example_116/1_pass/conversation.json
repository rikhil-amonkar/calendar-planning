You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Adam, John, Stephanie and Anna for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAdam has meetings on Monday during 14:00 to 15:00; \nJohn is busy on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nStephanie has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nAnna is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nAnna would rather not meet on Monday before 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the meeting start time and ensuring that the chosen time slot doesn't conflict with any participant's existing schedule while respecting Anna's preference to not meet before 14:30.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: The meeting start time will be represented as an integer variable in minutes from the start of the workday (9:00 AM, which is 540 minutes from midnight).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must fit within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so the end time must be start time + 30 minutes.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of the participants' busy times.\n   - Anna's preference is that the meeting starts no earlier than 14:30 (870 minutes from midnight).\n3. **Check for Solutions**: Use Z3 to check if there's a feasible start time that satisfies all constraints. If found, convert the start time back to HH:MM format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Define the start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes from midnight)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    work_start = 540\n    work_end = 1020\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Create solver instance\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Constraint: meeting must be within work hours\n    solver.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    solver.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n    \n    # Participants' busy times in minutes from 9:00 (subtract 540 to get minutes from 9:00)\n    # Adam: 14:00-15:00 \u2192 840-900\n    # John: 13:00-13:30 \u2192 780-810, 14:00-14:30 \u2192 840-870, 15:30-16:00 \u2192 930-960, 16:30-17:00 \u2192 990-1020\n    # Stephanie: 9:30-10:00 \u2192 570-600, 10:30-11:00 \u2192 630-660, 11:30-16:00 \u2192 690-960, 16:30-17:00 \u2192 990-1020\n    # Anna: 9:30-10:00 \u2192 570-600, 12:00-12:30 \u2192 720-750, 13:00-15:30 \u2192 780-930, 16:30-17:00 \u2192 990-1020\n    \n    # Anna's preference: not before 14:30 \u2192 start_time >= 870 (14:30 is 870 minutes from midnight)\n    solver.add(start_time >= 870)\n    \n    # Adam's busy: 840-900\n    solver.add(Or(\n        start_time + meeting_duration <= 840,\n        start_time >= 900\n    ))\n    \n    # John's busy: 780-810, 840-870, 930-960, 990-1020\n    solver.add(Or(\n        start_time + meeting_duration <= 780,\n        And(start_time >= 810, start_time + meeting_duration <= 840),\n        And(start_time >= 870, start_time + meeting_duration <= 930),\n        And(start_time >= 960, start_time + meeting_duration <= 990)\n    ))\n    \n    # Stephanie's busy: 570-600, 630-660, 690-960, 990-1020\n    solver.add(Or(\n        start_time + meeting_duration <= 570,\n        And(start_time >= 600, start_time + meeting_duration <= 630),\n        And(start_time >= 660, start_time + meeting_duration <= 690),\n        start_time >= 960\n    ))\n    \n    # Anna's busy: 570-600, 720-750, 780-930, 990-1020\n    solver.add(Or(\n        start_time + meeting_duration <= 570,\n        And(start_time >= 600, start_time + meeting_duration <= 720),\n        And(start_time >= 750, start_time + meeting_duration <= 780),\n        start_time >= 930\n    ))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_min = model[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM\n        start_hour = start_min // 60\n        start_min = start_min % 60\n        end_min_total = start_min + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = start_hour + (end_min_total // 60)\n        end_min = end_min_total % 60\n        \n        # Format the output\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_hour:02d}:{start_min:02d}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_hour:02d}:{end_min:02d}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Variables and Constraints**: The start time of the meeting is represented as an integer in minutes from 9:00 AM (540 minutes from midnight). The solver checks if this start time can be set such that the 30-minute meeting does not overlap with any participant's busy times and adheres to Anna's preference.\n- **Busy Times Handling**: For each participant, constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap with their busy intervals. This is done by ensuring the meeting either starts and ends before a busy interval starts or starts after a busy interval ends.\n- **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format for readability, showing the meeting day, start, and end times.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times using constraint programming, ensuring all conditions are met for a feasible schedule."
