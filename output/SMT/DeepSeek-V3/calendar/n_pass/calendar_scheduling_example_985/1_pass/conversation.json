You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diane and Matthew for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nDiane is busy on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 15:30, Tuesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 15:30 to 16:30, Friday during 9:30 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \nMatthew has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 16:00, Friday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nMatthew would rather not meet on Wednesday before 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints that must be satisfied to find a valid meeting time. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables for the day, start time, and duration (which is fixed at one hour).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be within work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any existing busy times for Diane or Matthew.\n   - The meeting must respect Matthew's preference to not meet on Wednesday before 12:30.\n3. **Solve**: Use Z3 to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.\n4. **Output**: Format the solution as specified.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing this solution:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define possible days (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, ..., 4=Friday)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 4)\n\n    # Define start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 = 9:00, 480 = 17:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= 0, start_time <= 480 - 60)  # Meeting duration is 60 minutes\n\n    # Convert start_time to HH:MM format for constraints\n    def time_to_hhmm(minutes):\n        hours = 9 + minutes // 60\n        mins = minutes % 60\n        return hours, mins\n\n    # Diane's busy times per day in minutes from 9:00\n    diane_busy = {\n        0: [(180, 210), (360, 390)],  # Monday: 12:00-12:30, 15:00-15:30\n        1: [(60, 120), (150, 180), (210, 240), (420, 480)],  # Tuesday: 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 16:00-17:00\n        2: [(0, 30), (330, 360), (390, 480)],  # Wednesday: 9:00-9:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00\n        3: [(390, 450)],  # Thursday: 15:30-16:30\n        4: [(30, 150), (330, 360), (420, 480)]  # Friday: 9:30-11:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-17:00\n    }\n\n    # Matthew's busy times per day in minutes from 9:00\n    matthew_busy = {\n        0: [(0, 60), (90, 480)],  # Monday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-17:00\n        1: [(0, 480)],  # Tuesday: 9:00-17:00\n        2: [(0, 120), (180, 330), (420, 480)],  # Wednesday: 9:00-11:00, 12:00-14:30, 16:00-17:00\n        3: [(0, 420)],  # Thursday: 9:00-16:00\n        4: [(0, 480)]  # Friday: 9:00-17:00\n    }\n\n    # Matthew's preference: not on Wednesday before 12:30 (210 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(Not(And(day == 2, start_time < 210)))\n\n    # Function to check if the meeting overlaps with any busy interval\n    def no_overlap(day_val, start, duration, busy_intervals):\n        return And([Or(\n            day != day_val,\n            start >= end,\n            start + duration <= begin\n        ) for (begin, end) in busy_intervals])\n\n    # Add constraints for Diane and Matthew\n    for d in range(5):\n        s.add(Implies(day == d, no_overlap(d, start_time, 60, diane_busy[d])))\n        s.add(Implies(day == d, no_overlap(d, start_time, 60, matthew_busy[d])))\n\n    # Check for solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n\n        # Map day_val to day name\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n        day_name = days[day_val]\n\n        # Convert start_val to HH:MM\n        start_hour = 9 + start_val // 60\n        start_min = start_val % 60\n        end_hour = start_hour + 1\n        end_min = start_min\n\n        # Format start and end times as HH:MM\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_min:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_min:02d}\"\n\n        # Print solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Variables**:\n   - `day`: Integer representing the day of the week (0 to 4 for Monday to Friday).\n   - `start_time`: Integer representing the start time in minutes from 9:00 AM (e.g., 0 = 9:00, 60 = 10:00).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be within 9:00 to 17:00 (start_time between 0 and 480 - 60 minutes).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any busy intervals for Diane or Matthew.\n   - Matthew's preference to not meet on Wednesday before 12:30 is enforced by adding a constraint that if the day is Wednesday, the start time must be \u2265 210 minutes (12:30 PM).\n\n3. **Solution Extraction**:\n   - The model is checked for satisfiability. If a solution exists, the day and start time are converted to the required format and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring all constraints and preferences are respected."
