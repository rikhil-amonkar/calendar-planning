You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ronald and Amber for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nRonald has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nAmber has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

The approach involves modeling the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem where we define variables for the day, start time, and duration, and then add constraints based on the participants' blocked schedules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the day (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday), start time (in minutes from 9:00), and duration (30 minutes).\n2. **Constraints for Work Hours**: The meeting must start between 9:00 and 16:30 (since it's a 30-minute meeting ending by 17:00).\n3. **Constraints for Blocked Times**: For each participant, the meeting time must not overlap with their blocked time slots.\n4. **Earliest Meeting Time**: We'll use the solver to find the earliest possible start time that satisfies all constraints by minimizing the start time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the possible days (0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 2)\n    \n    # Define the start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes in 24-hour format)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    # The meeting must start no earlier than 9:00 and end by 17:00\n    s.add(start_time >= 0, start_time + duration <= 480)  # 540 + 480 = 1020 (17:00)\n    \n    # Ronald's blocked times per day in minutes from 9:00\n    # Format: {day: [(start1, end1), (start2, end2), ...]}\n    ronald_blocked = {\n        0: [(90, 120), (180, 210), (390, 420)],  # Monday: 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 15:30-16:00\n        1: [(0, 30), (180, 210), (390, 450)],     # Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 12:00-12:30, 15:30-16:30\n        2: [(30, 90), (120, 180), (210, 240), (270, 300), (450, 480)]  # Wednesday: 9:30-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 16:30-17:00\n    }\n    \n    # Amber's blocked times per day in minutes from 9:00\n    amber_blocked = {\n        0: [(0, 30), (60, 90), (150, 180), (210, 300), (330, 360), (390, 480)],  # Monday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00\n        1: [(0, 30), (60, 150), (180, 210), (270, 450), (450, 480)],  # Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-15:30, 16:30-17:00\n        2: [(0, 30), (60, 90), (120, 270), (360, 390)]  # Wednesday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30\n    }\n    \n    # Constraints for Ronald's availability\n    def add_blocked_constraints(blocked_times, day_var, time_var):\n        constraints = []\n        for d in blocked_times:\n            for (start, end) in blocked_times[d]:\n                # If the current day is d, then the meeting must not overlap with any blocked interval\n                constraints.append(Implies(day_var == d, Not(And(time_var < end, time_var + duration > start))))\n        return And(constraints)\n    \n    s.add(add_blocked_constraints(ronald_blocked, day, start_time))\n    s.add(add_blocked_constraints(amber_blocked, day, start_time))\n    \n    # To find the earliest time, we minimize the start_time\n    # We'll use the optimizer instead of the solver to find the minimal start_time\n    opt = Optimize()\n    opt.add(s.assertions())\n    opt.minimize(start_time + day * 480)  # Prioritize earlier days, then earlier times\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if opt.check() == sat:\n        m = opt.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert day_val to day name\n        days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']\n        selected_day = days[day_val]\n        \n        # Calculate start and end times in HH:MM format\n        total_minutes = 540 + start_val  # 9:00 is 540 minutes\n        hours = total_minutes // 60\n        minutes = total_minutes % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_time_val = total_minutes + duration\n        end_hours = end_time_val // 60\n        end_minutes = end_time_val % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Print the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {selected_day}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The variables `day` and `start_time` represent the meeting day and start time (in minutes from 9:00). Constraints ensure the meeting fits within work hours and avoids blocked times for both participants.\n2. **Blocked Times Handling**: For each participant, blocked times are converted into constraints that the meeting must not overlap. This is done using implications: if the meeting is on a specific day, it must not overlap with any blocked intervals on that day.\n3. **Optimization**: The optimizer minimizes the start time (prioritizing earlier days and times) to find the earliest feasible slot.\n4. **Output**: The solution is converted from minutes back to a 24-hour format for readability, specifying the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving and optimization to meet all given constraints."
