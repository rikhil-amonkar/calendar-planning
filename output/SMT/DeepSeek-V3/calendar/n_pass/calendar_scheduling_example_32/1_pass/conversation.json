You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Emily, Melissa and Frank for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nEmily has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMelissa is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nFrank has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFrank do not want to meet on Monday after 9:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the constraints of each participant's schedule and preferences into logical formulas that Z3 can process to find a feasible meeting time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We will create variables to represent the start time of the meeting. The start time will be constrained to the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday.\n2. **Encode Constraints**:\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must start and end within the 9:00 to 17:00 window.\n   - **Duration**: The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so the end time is start time + 30 minutes.\n   - **Existing Schedules**: For each participant, the meeting time must not overlap with their existing meetings.\n   - **Preferences**: Frank does not want to meet after 9:30, which means the meeting must start at or before 9:30 (but since work hours start at 9:00, the only possible start time is 9:00).\n3. **Check Feasibility**: Use Z3 to check if there exists a start time that satisfies all constraints. If such a time exists, decode it into the required format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_scheduling():\n    # Create a solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time as an integer representing minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes since midnight)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    work_start = 540  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 1020    # 17:00 in minutes\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    \n    # Constraint: start_time must be within work hours and the meeting must end by 17:00\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(start_time + duration <= work_end)\n    \n    # Emily's busy times (in minutes since midnight)\n    emily_busy = [\n        (600, 630),    # 10:00-10:30\n        (690, 750),    # 11:30-12:30\n        (840, 900),     # 14:00-15:00\n        (960, 990)      # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n    \n    # Melissa's busy times\n    melissa_busy = [\n        (570, 600),    # 9:30-10:00\n        (870, 900)      # 14:30-15:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Frank's busy times\n    frank_busy = [\n        (600, 630),     # 10:00-10:30\n        (660, 690),     # 11:00-11:30\n        (750, 780),     # 12:30-13:00\n        (810, 870),     # 13:30-14:30\n        (900, 960),     # 15:00-16:00\n        (990, 1020)     # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Frank's preference: does not want to meet after 9:30 (i.e., start_time must be <= 570 (9:30))\n    s.add(start_time <= 570)\n    \n    # Function to add no-overlap constraints for a person's busy times\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(busy_times):\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_times:\n            # The meeting must not overlap with any busy interval\n            s.add(Or(\n                start_time + duration <= busy_start,\n                start_time >= busy_end\n            ))\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(emily_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(melissa_busy)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(frank_busy)\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_minutes = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        hours = start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_minutes = start_minutes + duration\n        end_hours = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes = end_minutes % 60\n        end_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_meeting_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: The start time of the meeting is represented as an integer in minutes from midnight (540 minutes corresponds to 9:00 AM). The solver ensures the meeting fits within the 9:00 to 17:00 window and lasts 30 minutes.\n2. **Busy Times Handling**: Each participant's busy intervals are converted into minute values. For each interval, constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap with any busy period.\n3. **Preference Handling**: Frank's preference to not meet after 9:30 is encoded by restricting the start time to be at or before 570 minutes (9:30 AM).\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If Z3 finds a solution, the start time in minutes is converted back to a 24-hour format string. The meeting's end time is simply the start time plus 30 minutes.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the feasible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring all constraints and preferences are met. The solution outputs the earliest possible meeting time that fits everyone's schedule, which in this case is 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM on Monday."
