You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Emily, Mason, Maria, Carl, David and Frank for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nEmily has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMason is free the entire day.\nMaria has meetings on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 14:00 to 14:30; \nCarl has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nDavid has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \nFrank has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling each participant's schedule constraints and finding a 30-minute slot where all participants are free between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Time Slots**: The meeting must be scheduled in a 30-minute slot within the 9:00 to 17:00 window. We'll represent time in minutes from the start of the day (9:00 AM as 0 minutes, 17:00 PM as 480 minutes) for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Define Constraints**: For each participant, we'll define the times they are unavailable (based on their meetings). The meeting slot must not overlap with any of these unavailable times.\n3. **Check for Valid Slots**: The solver will check for a start time such that the 30-minute duration from that start time does not conflict with any participant's schedule.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize Z3 solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time variable in minutes from 9:00 (0 minutes is 9:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n    \n    # Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 is 8 hours = 480 minutes\n    min_time = 0   # 9:00 in minutes from 9:00\n    max_time = 480 - meeting_duration  # Latest start time is 16:30\n    \n    # Constraint: start_time must be within work hours and allow for the meeting duration\n    solver.add(start_time >= min_time)\n    solver.add(start_time <= max_time)\n    \n    # Each participant's busy times in minutes from 9:00\n    # Emily: 10:00-10:30 (60-90), 16:00-16:30 (420-450)\n    emily_busy = [(60, 90), (420, 450)]\n    # Mason: free all day\n    mason_busy = []\n    # Maria: 10:30-11:00 (90-120), 14:00-14:30 (300-330)\n    maria_busy = [(90, 120), (300, 330)]\n    # Carl: 9:30-10:00 (30-60), 10:30-12:30 (90-210), 13:30-14:00 (270-300), 14:30-15:30 (330-390), 16:00-17:00 (420-480)\n    carl_busy = [(30, 60), (90, 210), (270, 300), (330, 390), (420, 480)]\n    # David: 9:30-11:00 (30-120), 11:30-12:00 (150-180), 12:30-13:30 (210-270), 14:00-15:00 (300-360), 16:00-17:00 (420-480)\n    david_busy = [(30, 120), (150, 180), (210, 270), (300, 360), (420, 480)]\n    # Frank: 9:30-10:30 (30-90), 11:00-11:30 (120-150), 12:30-13:30 (210-270), 14:30-17:00 (330-480)\n    frank_busy = [(30, 90), (120, 150), (210, 270), (330, 480)]\n    \n    # Combine all participants' busy times\n    all_busy = {\n        'Emily': emily_busy,\n        'Mason': mason_busy,\n        'Maria': maria_busy,\n        'Carl': carl_busy,\n        'David': david_busy,\n        'Frank': frank_busy\n    }\n    \n    # For each participant, add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with their busy times\n    for participant, busy_times in all_busy.items():\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_times:\n            # The meeting should not overlap with this busy slot\n            # So either meeting ends before busy starts or starts after busy ends\n            solver.add(Or(\n                start_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start,\n                start_time >= busy_end\n            ))\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model.evaluate(start_time).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes back to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        start_minute = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Time Representation**: The start time is represented in minutes from 9:00 AM (0 minutes is 9:00 AM, 480 minutes is 5:00 PM). The meeting duration is fixed at 30 minutes.\n3. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting starts within the valid work hours (9:00 AM to 4:30 PM, allowing the meeting to end by 5:00 PM).\n4. **Busy Times Handling**: For each participant, their busy times are converted into minute ranges from 9:00 AM. The solver adds constraints that the meeting must not overlap with any of these busy periods.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a valid start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format and printed along with the meeting end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible 30-minute slots within the workday, ensuring no overlap with any participant's existing meetings, and outputs the first valid slot found."
