You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Nancy and Jose for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nNancy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 16:00; \nJose is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting, and then adding constraints based on the participants' availability and preferences. The goal is to find the earliest possible time that satisfies all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables to represent the day of the meeting (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday), the start time, and the end time. The start and end times will be in minutes since 9:00 AM (the start of the workday) to simplify arithmetic.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Duration**: The end time must be exactly 30 minutes after the start time.\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must occur between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM (540 to 1020 minutes since midnight, but we'll adjust to 0 to 480 minutes from 9:00 AM).\n   - **Participants' Availability**: The meeting must not overlap with any blocked times in Nancy's and Jose's schedules.\n3. **Optimization**: We aim to find the earliest possible meeting time, so we'll minimize the start time variable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 0 is 9:00, 30 is 9:30)\n    end_time = Int('end_time')\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    solver.add(end_time == start_time + 30)\n    \n    # Meeting must be within work hours (9:00-17:00)\n    solver.add(start_time >= 0)\n    solver.add(end_time <= 8 * 60)  # 8 hours * 60 minutes = 480 minutes (from 9:00 to 17:00)\n    \n    # Define the blocked times for each person on each day\n    # Nancy's blocked times:\n    nancy_blocked = {\n        0: [(10*60 - 9*60, 10*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Monday 10:00-10:30 (60-90)\n            (11*60 + 30 - 9*60, 12*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # 11:30-12:30 (150-210)\n            (13*60 + 30 - 9*60, 14*60 - 9*60),  # 13:30-14:00 (270-300)\n            (14*60 + 30 - 9*60, 15*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # 14:30-15:30 (330-390)\n            (16*60 - 9*60, 17*60 - 9*60)],  # 16:00-17:00 (420-480)\n        1: [(9*60 + 30 - 9*60, 10*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Tuesday 9:30-10:30 (30-90)\n            (11*60 - 9*60, 11*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # 11:00-11:30 (120-150)\n            (12*60 - 9*60, 12*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # 12:00-12:30 (180-210)\n            (13*60 - 9*60, 13*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # 13:00-13:30 (240-270)\n            (15*60 + 30 - 9*60, 16*60 - 9*60)],  # 15:30-16:00 (390-420)\n        2: [(10*60 - 9*60, 11*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Wednesday 10:00-11:30 (60-150)\n            (13*60 + 30 - 9*60, 16*60 - 9*60)]  # 13:30-16:00 (270-420)\n    }\n    \n    # Jose's blocked times:\n    jose_blocked = {\n        0: [(9*60 - 9*60, 17*60 - 9*60)],  # Monday 9:00-17:00 (0-480)\n        1: [(9*60 - 9*60, 17*60 - 9*60)],  # Tuesday 9:00-17:00 (0-480)\n        2: [(9*60 - 9*60, 9*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # Wednesday 9:00-9:30 (0-30)\n            (10*60 - 9*60, 12*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # 10:00-12:30 (60-210)\n            (13*60 + 30 - 9*60, 14*60 + 30 - 9*60),  # 13:30-14:30 (270-330)\n            (15*60 - 9*60, 17*60 - 9*60)]  # 15:00-17:00 (360-480)\n    }\n    \n    # Constraints for each possible day\n    day_constraints = []\n    \n    for d in [0, 1, 2]:\n        # Nancy's availability on day d\n        nancy_available = True\n        for (block_start, block_end) in nancy_blocked[d]:\n            # The meeting must not overlap with any blocked interval\n            nancy_available = And(nancy_available,\n                                  Or(end_time <= block_start, start_time >= block_end))\n        \n        # Jose's availability on day d\n        jose_available = True\n        for (block_start, block_end) in jose_blocked[d]:\n            jose_available = And(jose_available,\n                                Or(end_time <= block_start, start_time >= block_end))\n        \n        # If day is d, both must be available\n        day_constraints.append(And(day == d, nancy_available, jose_available))\n    \n    solver.add(Or(day_constraints[0], day_constraints[1], day_constraints[2]))\n    \n    # Optimize for the earliest start time\n    opt = Optimize()\n    opt.add(solver.assertions())\n    opt.minimize(start_time)\n    \n    if opt.check() == sat:\n        model = opt.model()\n        d = model[day].as_long()\n        s = model[start_time].as_long()\n        e = model[end_time].as_long()\n        \n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        selected_day = days[d]\n        \n        # Convert start_time and end_time back to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = 9 + s // 60\n        start_minute = s % 60\n        end_hour = 9 + e // 60\n        end_minute = e % 60\n        \n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {selected_day}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints Setup**: The variables `day`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are defined to represent the meeting's day and time. The `end_time` is constrained to be 30 minutes after `start_time`.\n2. **Blocked Times Handling**: The blocked times for Nancy and Jose are converted into minute offsets from 9:00 AM. For each day, constraints ensure the meeting does not overlap with any blocked intervals.\n3. **Day Constraints**: For each possible day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), constraints are added to check availability for both participants. The solver checks if the meeting can be scheduled on any of these days without conflicts.\n4. **Optimization**: The solver minimizes the `start_time` to find the earliest possible meeting time. If a solution exists, it converts the minute offsets back into HH:MM format and prints the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving and optimization to meet all given constraints while finding the earliest feasible slot."
