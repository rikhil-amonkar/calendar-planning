You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Betty and Scott for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBetty is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nScott is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nBetty can not meet on Monday. Tuesday. Thursday before 15:00. Scott would like to avoid more meetings on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a meeting time that satisfies all the given constraints. The approach involves encoding the participants' busy times, their preferences, and the meeting duration into logical constraints that Z3 can solve.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting. The day will be represented as an integer (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, etc.), and the start and end times will be integers representing minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes, since 9:00 AM is 540 minutes past midnight).\n2. **Constraints for Meeting Duration**: The end time must be exactly 30 minutes after the start time.\n3. **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes).\n4. **Busy Times Constraints**: For each participant, the meeting time must not overlap with any of their busy periods.\n5. **Preferences Constraints**: Incorporate Betty's preference to not meet on Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday before 15:00, and Scott's preference to avoid more meetings on Wednesday.\n6. **Solve and Extract Solution**: Use Z3 to solve the constraints, then convert the solution back into the desired day and time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_scheduling():\n    #

Scott's preference to avoid Wednesday is handled by first trying to find a solution excluding Wednesday, and only including Wednesday if no other solution exists.\n4. **Busy Times Handling**: For each participant, their busy times are converted into constraints ensuring the meeting does not overlap with any busy period.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: The solver checks for a valid meeting time. If found, the solution is converted from numerical representations back into day names and 24-hour time format for output.\n\nThis approach systematically encodes all constraints and preferences into the Z3 solver, which efficiently finds a valid meeting time or confirms no solution exists under the given constraints."
