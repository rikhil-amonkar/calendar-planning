You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Betty and Scott for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBetty is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nScott is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nBetty can not meet on Monday. Tuesday. Thursday before 15:00. Scott would like to avoid more meetings on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the day and start time of the meeting, then adding constraints based on the participants' busy schedules and preferences. The solution will find a valid time slot that meets all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We need variables for the day (encoded as integers) and the start time (in minutes from 9:00 AM).\n2. **Constraints on Day and Time**: The meeting must be within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and last 30 minutes.\n3. **Busy Schedules**: For each participant, add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with their busy times.\n4. **Preferences**: Incorporate Betty's and Scott's preferences (Betty cannot meet on Monday, or before 15:00 on Tuesday and Thursday; Scott prefers to avoid Wednesday).\n5. **Solve**: Use Z3 to find a satisfying assignment for the variables under all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the possible days (0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday, 3: Thursday)\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 3)\n\n    # Define the start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes in 24-hour format)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= 0, start_time <= 8 * 60)  # 9:00-17:00 is 8 hours (480 minutes)\n\n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    end_time = start_time + duration\n    s.add(end_time <= 8 * 60)\n\n    # Betty's constraints\n    # Betty cannot meet on Monday (day 0)\n    s.add(day != 0)\n    # Betty cannot meet before 15:00 on Tuesday (day 1) and Thursday (day 3)\n    s.add(Or(day != 1, start_time >= (15 - 9) * 60))\n    s.add(Or(day != 3, start_time >= (15 - 9) * 60))\n\n    #

Scott's preference to avoid Wednesday is handled by first attempting to find a solution without Wednesday, and if none exists, allowing Wednesday.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: The model's solution is extracted, converting the day index to a day name and the start time from minutes to a 24-hour format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities, ensuring all constraints and preferences are respected."
