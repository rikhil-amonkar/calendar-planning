You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Martha and Beverly for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMartha has blocked their calendar on Monday during 16:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 15:00 to 15:30, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 14:00 to 14:30; \nBeverly has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the day, start time, and duration of the meeting, then adding constraints based on the participants' blocked times and the meeting duration. Here's the Python code that implements this solution:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the possible days\n    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']\n    day = Int('day')\n    s.add(day >= 0, day < len(days))  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n\n    # Define the start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    s.add(start_time >= 540, start_time <= 1020 - 60)  # 9:00 to 17:00 - 1 hour\n\n    # Convert start time to HH:MM format\n    def time_to_str(t):\n        h = t // 60\n        m = t % 60\n        return f\"{h:02d}:{m:02d}\"\n\n    # Martha's blocked times (each is a list of (day, start, end) in minutes)\n    martha_blocks = [\n        (0, 960, 1020),   # Monday 16:00-17:00\n        (1, 900, 930),     # Tuesday 15:00-15:30\n        (2, 600, 660),     # Wednesday 10:00-11:00\n        (2, 840, 870),     # Wednesday 14:00-14:30\n    ]\n\n    # Beverly's blocked times\n    beverly_blocks = [\n        (0, 540, 810),    # Monday 9:00-13:30\n        (0, 840, 1020),    # Monday 14:00-17:00\n        (1, 540, 1020),   # Tuesday 9:00-17:00\n        (2, 570, 930),     # Wednesday 9:30-15:30\n        (2, 990, 1020),    # Wednesday 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n\n    # Function to check if a time slot is blocked for a person\n    def is_blocked(person_blocks, d, st, et):\n        # Check each block for the person\n        for block in person_blocks:\n            block_day, block_st, block_et = block\n            # If same day and overlapping times\n            if d == block_day:\n                if Not(Or(et <= block_st, st >= block_et)):\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    # The meeting duration is 1 hour (60 minutes)\n    meeting_duration = 60\n    end_time = start_time + meeting_duration\n\n    # Add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with blocked times\n    s.add(Not(is_blocked(martha_blocks, day, start_time, end_time)))\n    s.add(Not(is_blocked(beverly_blocks, day, start_time, end_time)))\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_idx = m[day].as_long()\n        start = m[start_time].as_long()\n        end = start + meeting_duration\n        day_str = days[day_idx]\n        start_str = time_to_str(start)\n        end_str = time_to_str(end)\n        print(f\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Variables**:\n   - `day`: Represents the day of the meeting (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, 2 for Wednesday).\n   - `start_time`: Represents the start time of the meeting in minutes from midnight (e.g., 540 for 9:00 AM).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and last 1 hour.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any blocked times for Martha or Beverly.\n\n3. **Blocked Times**:\n   - Martha's and Beverly's blocked times are converted to minutes from midnight for easier comparison.\n   - The `is_blocked` function checks if a proposed meeting time overlaps with any blocked time for a given person.\n\n4. **Solution Extraction**:\n   - If a solution exists, the model is queried for the day and start time, which are then converted to the required output format.\n\nThe code outputs the first valid meeting time that satisfies all constraints. The solution is guaranteed to exist as per the problem statement."
