You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Cheryl and James for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nCheryl's calendar is wide open the entire week.\nJames has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 16:00, Thursday during 9:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nCheryl would rather not meet on Wednesday. Thursday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves encoding the constraints of each participant's schedule and preferences into logical formulas that Z3 can solve. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll create variables for the day, start time, and end time of the meeting.\n2. **Enumerate Days**: Convert days (Monday to Thursday) into numerical values for easier manipulation.\n3. **Extract Busy Slots**: For each participant, list their busy time slots on each day.\n4. **Add Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be 30 minutes long.\n   - The meeting must be within working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any busy slots of the participants.\n   - Respect Cheryl's preference to avoid Wednesday and Thursday if possible.\n   - Prefer the earliest possible time.\n5. **Solve and Extract Solution**: Use Z3 to find a solution that satisfies all constraints, then format the output.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this solution:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    #

Cheryl's preference to avoid Wednesday and Thursday is implemented by first trying to solve without those days.\n5. **James's Busy Slots**: For each day, James's busy slots are listed. The solver ensures the meeting does not overlap with any of these slots.\n6. **Earliest Time**: After determining a feasible day, the code checks all possible 30-minute slots in order to find the earliest available one that doesn't conflict with James's schedule.\n7. **Output**: The solution is formatted as specified, indicating the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging Z3's constraint-solving capabilities and then selects the earliest feasible slot."
