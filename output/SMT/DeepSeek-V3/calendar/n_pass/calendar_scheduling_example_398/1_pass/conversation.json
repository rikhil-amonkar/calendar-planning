You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Doris, Theresa, Christian, Terry, Carolyn and Kyle for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDoris has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nTheresa has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 12:00; \nChristianhas no meetings the whole day.\nTerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nCarolyn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \nKyle has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling each participant's availability as constraints and finding a time slot that satisfies all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We will define variables for the start time of the meeting. The start time will be represented in minutes since 9:00 AM (the start of the workday) to simplify calculations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: For each participant, we will add constraints that the meeting must not overlap with any of their blocked time slots. The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so the end time is start time + 30 minutes.\n3. **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must entirely fit within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 (i.e., 540 to 1020 minutes, where 9:00 AM is 540 minutes from midnight).\n4. **Check for Solution**: The solver checks if there exists a start time that meets all constraints. If found, it converts the start time back to a readable format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (540 to 1020 minutes)\n    work_start = 540  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 1020    # 17:00 in minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Define the start time variable (in minutes since 9:00, so 0 is 9:00)\n    start = Int('start')\n    s.add(start >= 0)\n    s.add(start + meeting_duration <= work_end - work_start)\n    \n    # Each participant's blocked times in minutes since 9:00\n    # Doris's blocked times: 9:00-11:00 (0-120), 13:30-14:00 (270-300), 16:00-16:30 (420-450)\n    doris_blocks = [(0, 120), (270, 300), (420, 450)]\n    # Theresa's blocked times: 10:00-12:00 (60-180)\n    theresa_blocks = [(60, 180)]\n    # Christian has no blocks\n    christian_blocks = []\n    # Terry's blocked times: 9:30-10:00 (30-60), 11:30-12:00 (150-180), 12:30-13:00 (210-240), 13:30-14:00 (270-300), 14:30-15:00 (330-360), 15:30-17:00 (390-480)\n    terry_blocks = [(30, 60), (150, 180), (210, 240), (270, 300), (330, 360), (390, 480)]\n    # Carolyn's blocked times: 9:00-10:30 (0-90), 11:00-11:30 (120-150), 12:00-13:00 (180-240), 13:30-14:30 (270-330), 15:00-17:00 (360-480)\n    carolyn_blocks = [(0, 90), (120, 150), (180, 240), (270, 330), (360, 480)]\n    # Kyle's blocked times: 9:00-9:30 (0-30), 11:30-12:00 (150-180), 12:30-13:00 (210-240), 14:30-17:00 (330-480)\n    kyle_blocks = [(0, 30), (150, 180), (210, 240), (330, 480)]\n    \n    # Function to add constraints for each participant's blocks\n    def add_participant_constraints(blocks):\n        for block in blocks:\n            block_start, block_end = block\n            # The meeting must not overlap with the block: meeting is before or after\n            s.add(Or(start + meeting_duration <= block_start, start >= block_end))\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    add_participant_constraints(doris_blocks)\n    add_participant_constraints(theresa_blocks)\n    add_participant_constraints(christian_blocks)\n    add_participant_constraints(terry_blocks)\n    add_participant_constraints(carolyn_blocks)\n    add_participant_constraints(kyle_blocks)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_minutes = model[start].as_long()\n        # Convert start minutes back to time\n        total_minutes = work_start + start_minutes\n        hours = total_minutes // 60\n        minutes = total_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        end_minutes = total_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hours = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes_remainder = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes_remainder:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables and Constraints**: The start time of the meeting is defined as an integer variable. The constraints ensure the meeting fits within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and does not overlap with any blocked times of the participants.\n3. **Blocked Times Handling**: Each participant's blocked times are converted into minutes since 9:00 AM. For each block, a constraint is added to ensure the meeting does not overlap.\n4. **Solution Check**: The solver checks for a feasible start time. If found, it converts the start time from minutes back to a 24-hour format and prints the solution.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by systematically applying constraints and leveraging the Z3 solver to find a feasible slot that accommodates all participants."
