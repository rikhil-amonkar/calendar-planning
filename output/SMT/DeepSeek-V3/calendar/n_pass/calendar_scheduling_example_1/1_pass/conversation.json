You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nRaymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nBilly has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nDonald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nBilly would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we will use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves modeling the problem with constraints that ensure the meeting time does not overlap with any participant's blocked times and respects Billy's preference to avoid meetings after 15:00 on Monday.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We will define variables to represent the start time of the meeting in minutes from the start of the workday (9:00 AM).\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The meeting must be 30 minutes long.\n   - The meeting must fit within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of the participants' blocked times.\n   - The meeting must start before 15:00 to respect Billy's preference (since the meeting is 30 minutes, the latest start time is 14:30 to end by 15:00).\n3. **Check Satisfiability**: Use Z3 to check if there's a solution that satisfies all constraints. If found, convert the start time from minutes back to a readable time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_meeting_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Work hours are 9:00 to 17:00 (9*60 to 17*60 in minutes)\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n    \n    # Define the start time variable (in minutes from 0:00)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    \n    # Constraints for work hours\n    solver.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    solver.add(start_time + duration <= work_end)\n    \n    # Billy's preference: meeting should end by 15:00 (so start by 14:30)\n    solver.add(start_time + duration <= 15 * 60)\n    \n    # Participants' blocked times in minutes since midnight\n    # Raymond's blocked times\n    raymond_blocked = [\n        (9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30),    # 9:00-9:30\n        (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60),  # 11:30-12:00\n        (13 * 60, 13 * 60 + 30),   # 13:00-13:30\n        (15 * 60, 15 * 60 + 30)    # 15:00-15:30\n    ]\n    \n    # Billy's blocked times\n    billy_blocked = [\n        (10 * 60, 10 * 60 + 30),   # 10:00-10:30\n        (12 * 60, 13 * 60),         # 12:00-13:00\n        (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)     # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Donald's blocked times\n    donald_blocked = [\n        (9 * 60, 9 * 60 + 30),      # 9:00-9:30\n        (10 * 60, 11 * 60),          # 10:00-11:00\n        (12 * 60, 13 * 60),         # 12:00-13:00\n        (14 * 60, 14 * 60 + 30),     # 14:00-14:30\n        (16 * 60, 17 * 60)           # 16:00-17:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Function to add no-overlap constraints for a participant's blocked times\n    def add_no_overlap_constraints(blocked_times):\n        for (block_start, block_end) in blocked_times:\n            solver.add(Or(\n                start_time + duration <= block_start,\n                start_time >= block_end\n            ))\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(raymond_blocked)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(billy_blocked)\n    add_no_overlap_constraints(donald_blocked)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model.evaluate(start_time).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n        hours = start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_minutes = start_minutes + duration\n        end_hours = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes_remainder = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes_remainder:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\n# Call the function to solve the problem\nsolve_meeting_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables and Constraints**: The start time of the meeting is modeled as an integer variable representing minutes from midnight. Constraints ensure the meeting fits within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and is 30 minutes long.\n3. **Participant Constraints**: Each participant's blocked times are converted into minutes from midnight. The solver ensures the meeting does not overlap with any blocked intervals by adding constraints that the meeting must either end before a blocked interval starts or start after it ends.\n4. **Billy's Preference**: An additional constraint ensures the meeting ends by 15:00, respecting Billy's preference.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start time in minutes is converted back to a 24-hour format for readability. The solution is printed in the specified format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint satisfaction, ensuring all participants' schedules and preferences are respected."
