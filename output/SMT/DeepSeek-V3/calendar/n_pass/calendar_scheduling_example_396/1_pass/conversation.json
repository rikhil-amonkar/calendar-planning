You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Andrea, Jack, Madison, Rachel, Douglas and Ryan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAndrea's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nJack has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:00 to 14:30; \nMadison has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nRachel is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nDouglas is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 16:30; \nRyan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find a time slot that fits all participants' schedules. The approach involves encoding each participant's busy times as constraints and then finding a 30-minute window where none of the participants are busy.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: We'll define variables for the start time of the meeting in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes, since 9:00 AM is 540 minutes past midnight).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start and end within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - The meeting duration is 30 minutes.\n   - The meeting time must not overlap with any of the participants' busy times.\n3. **Model Solving**: Use Z3 to check for a feasible solution that satisfies all constraints. If found, convert the start time from minutes back to a readable time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef find_meeting_time():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define the start time in minutes from 9:00 (540 minutes from midnight)\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    # Working hours: 9:00 (540) to 17:00 (1020)\n    s.add(start_time >= 540)\n    s.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= 1020)\n\n    # Each participant's busy times in minutes from midnight\n    # Format: list of (start, end) tuples for each participant\n    andrea_busy = []\n    jack_busy = [(540, 570), (840, 870)]\n    madison_busy = [(570, 630), (780, 840), (900, 930), (990, 1020)]\n    rachel_busy = [(570, 630), (660, 690), (720, 810), (870, 930), (960, 1020)]\n    douglas_busy = [(540, 690), (720, 990)]\n    ryan_busy = [(540, 570), (780, 840), (870, 1020)]\n\n    # Combine all busy times\n    all_busy = jack_busy + madison_busy + rachel_busy + douglas_busy + ryan_busy\n\n    # Add constraints that the meeting does not overlap with any busy time\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in all_busy:\n        s.add(Or(\n            start_time + meeting_duration <= busy_start,\n            start_time >= busy_end\n        ))\n\n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_min = m[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to HH:MM\n        hours = start_min // 60\n        minutes = start_min % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_min = start_min + meeting_duration\n        end_hours = end_min // 60\n        end_minutes = end_min % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        print(f\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nfind_meeting_time()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variables and Constraints**:\n   - `start_time` is defined as an integer representing minutes from midnight. The constraints ensure it lies within working hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n   - Each participant's busy times are converted into minute intervals from midnight. For example, 9:30 AM is 570 minutes (9 * 60 + 30).\n3. **Non-overlapping Constraint**: For each busy interval, the solver ensures the meeting either starts after the busy interval ends or ends before it starts.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start time in minutes is converted back to HH:MM format. The end time is simply the start time plus 30 minutes.\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed in the specified format, showing the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible time slots within the working hours and ensures the meeting does not conflict with any participant's schedule, leveraging the power of the Z3 solver for constraint satisfaction."
