You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Andrew, Grace and Samuel for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAndrew's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nGracehas no meetings the whole day.\nSamuel has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver to find the earliest available time slot that accommodates all participants' schedules. The approach involves encoding the constraints based on each participant's availability and finding a valid 30-minute slot within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday.\n\nHere's the Python code using the Z3 solver:\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (9*60 to 17*60 in minutes)\n    work_start = 9 * 60\n    work_end = 17 * 60\n\n    # Meeting duration: 30 minutes\n    duration = 30\n\n    # Define the start time of the meeting in minutes since midnight\n    start_time = Int('start_time')\n    end_time = start_time + duration\n\n    # Constraint: meeting must be within work hours\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(end_time <= work_end)\n\n    # Participants' busy times in minutes since midnight\n    # Andrew and Grace are free all day, so no constraints\n    # Samuel's busy times: 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n    samuel_busy = [\n        (9 * 60, 10 * 60 + 30),\n        (11 * 60 + 30, 12 * 60),\n        (13 * 60, 13 * 60 + 30),\n        (14 * 60, 16 * 60),\n        (16 * 60 + 30, 17 * 60)\n    ]\n\n    # Constraint: meeting must not overlap with Samuel's busy times\n    for busy_start, busy_end in samuel_busy:\n        s.add(Or(\n            end_time <= busy_start,\n            start_time >= busy_end\n        ))\n\n    # Find the earliest possible meeting time\n    s.push()\n    s.add(start_time == work_start)\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        earliest_start = m[start_time].as_long()\n        earliest_end = earliest_start + duration\n    else:\n        s.pop()\n        # If not at work_start, find the minimal start_time\n        s.minimize(start_time)\n        if s.check() == sat:\n            m = s.model()\n            earliest_start = m[start_time].as_long()\n            earliest_end = earliest_start + duration\n        else:\n            return \"No solution found\"\n\n    # Convert minutes back to HH:MM format\n    def minutes_to_time(minutes):\n        hh = minutes // 60\n        mm = minutes % 60\n        return f\"{hh:02d}:{mm:02d}\"\n\n    start_str = minutes_to_time(earliest_start)\n    end_str = minutes_to_time(earliest_end)\n\n    return f\"\"\"SOLUTION:\nDay: Monday\nStart Time: {start_str}\nEnd Time: {end_str}\"\"\"\n\nprint(solve_scheduling())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize the Z3 solver and define the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) and meeting duration (30 minutes).\n2. **Variables**: The `start_time` is an integer variable representing the meeting start time in minutes since midnight. The `end_time` is `start_time + duration`.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be within work hours.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with Samuel's busy times. This is enforced by ensuring the meeting is either entirely before or after each of Samuel's busy intervals.\n4. **Earliest Time**: We first check if the meeting can start at the earliest possible time (9:00). If not, we use the solver's minimization feature to find the smallest `start_time` that satisfies all constraints.\n5. **Output**: The solution is converted from minutes back to `HH:MM` format and printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the earliest possible meeting time that works for all participants."
