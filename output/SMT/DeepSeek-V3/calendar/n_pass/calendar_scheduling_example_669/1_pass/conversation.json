You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jean and Doris for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJean is busy on Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDoris has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nDoris would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we'll use the Z3 solver, a powerful tool for constraint satisfaction problems. The approach involves defining variables for the meeting day, start time, and end time, then adding constraints based on the participants' busy schedules and preferences. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Define Variables**: \n   - **Day**: A variable representing the day of the meeting (Monday or Tuesday).\n   - **Start Time**: A variable representing the start time of the meeting in minutes since 9:00 AM (work hours start at 9:00).\n   - **Duration**: Fixed at 30 minutes as per the problem statement.\n   \n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must start between 9:00 and 16:30 (since it's a 30-minute meeting and work ends at 17:00).\n   - **Jean's Busy Times**: On Tuesday, Jean is busy from 11:30-12:00 and 16:00-16:30.\n   - **Doris's Busy Times**: On Monday, Doris is busy from 9:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. On Tuesday, she is busy all day.\n   - **Doris's Preference**: Prefers not to meet on Monday after 14:00, so any meeting on Monday must end by 14:00.\n\n3. **Solve**: Use Z3 to find values for the variables that satisfy all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef solve_scheduling():\n    # Create solver instance\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from 9:00 (0 to 480 (8 hours))\n\n    # Constants\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    work_start = 0  # 9:00 in minutes from 9:00\n    work_end = 480   # 17:00 is 8*60=480 minutes from 9:00\n\n    # Constraints for day: 0 (Monday) or 1 (Tuesday)\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1))\n\n    # Constraints for start_time: must allow meeting to finish by 17:00\n    s.add(start_time >= work_start)\n    s.add(start_time + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Jean's constraints\n    # On Tuesday (day 1), Jean is busy 11:30-12:00 and 16:00-16:30\n    # Convert these times to minutes from 9:00:\n    # 11:30 is 2.5 hours = 150 minutes\n    # 12:00 is 3 hours = 180 minutes\n    # 16:00 is 7 hours = 420 minutes\n    # 16:30 is 7.5 hours = 450 minutes\n    jean_busy1_start = 150\n    jean_busy1_end = 180\n    jean_busy2_start = 420\n    jean_busy2_end = 450\n\n    # The meeting should not overlap with Jean's busy times on Tuesday\n    s.add(Implies(day == 1, \n                  And(Not(And(start_time < jean_busy1_end, start_time + meeting_duration > jean_busy1_start)),\n                      Not(And(start_time < jean_busy2_end, start_time + meeting_duration > jean_busy2_start)))))\n\n    # Doris's constraints\n    # On Monday (day 0), busy times:\n    # 9:00-11:30 (0 to 150 minutes)\n    # 12:00-12:30 (180 to 210 minutes)\n    # 13:30-16:00 (270 to 420 minutes)\n    # 16:30-17:00 (450 to 480 minutes)\n    doris_monday_busy = [\n        (0, 150),\n        (180, 210),\n        (270, 420),\n        (450, 480)\n    ]\n    # On Tuesday (day 1), busy all day (so meeting can't be on Tuesday)\n    s.add(Implies(day == 1, False))  # Because Doris is busy all day Tuesday\n\n    # For Monday, the meeting must not overlap with any of Doris's busy times\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in doris_monday_busy:\n        s.add(Implies(day == 0, \n                      Not(And(start_time < busy_end, start_time + meeting_duration > busy_start))))\n\n    # Doris's preference: not after 14:00 on Monday, so meeting must end by 14:00\n    # 14:00 is 5 hours from 9:00 = 300 minutes\n    s.add(Implies(day == 0, start_time + meeting_duration <= 300))\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        day_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_time].as_long()\n\n        # Convert day_val to day name\n        day_name = \"Monday\" if day_val == 0 else \"Tuesday\"\n\n        # Calculate start and end times in HH:MM format\n        start_hour = 9 + start_val // 60\n        start_min = start_val % 60\n        end_time_val = start_val + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = 9 + end_time_val // 60\n        end_min = end_time_val % 60\n\n        # Formatting to two digits\n        start_time_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_min:02d}\"\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_min:02d}\"\n\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nsolve_scheduling()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constants**: The variables `day` (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday) and `start_time` (minutes from 9:00) are defined. The meeting duration is fixed at 30 minutes.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **Day Constraint**: The meeting must be on Monday or Tuesday.\n   - **Work Hours Constraint**: The meeting must start no earlier than 9:00 and end no later than 17:00.\n   - **Jean's Busy Times**: On Tuesday, the meeting must avoid Jean's busy periods (11:30-12:00 and 16:00-16:30).\n   - **Doris's Busy Times**: On Monday, the meeting must avoid Doris's busy periods. On Tuesday, Doris is busy all day, so the meeting cannot be scheduled then.\n   - **Doris's Preference**: The meeting on Monday must end by 14:00.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If Z3 finds a solution, it converts the day and start time into readable formats (e.g., \"Monday\", \"12:30\") and prints the solution.\n\nThis approach systematically models the constraints and uses Z3 to find a feasible meeting time that respects all participants' schedules and preferences."
