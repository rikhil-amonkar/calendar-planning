        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends we can meet in San Francisco given their availability windows and travel times between locations. The solution involves using constraint programming to model the problem and the Z3 solver to find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. Each friend has a specific location, availability window, and minimum meeting duration. Travel times between locations are provided. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible without overlapping meetings and respecting travel times and availability constraints.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Travel Times**: The travel times between locations are asymmetric (e.g., traveling from A to B may take a different time than from B to A).\n   - **Time Windows**: Each friend is available during specific time windows. Meetings must start and end within these windows, accounting for travel times.\n   - **Dummy Meeting**: A dummy meeting at Haight-Ashbury is used to model the starting point at 9:00 AM with zero duration.\n\n3. **Modeling**:\n   - **Variables**: For each friend, a boolean variable indicates if they are met, and an integer variable represents the meeting start time.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Availability**: If a friend is met, their meeting must start within their availability window and last at least the minimum duration.\n     - **Travel from Start**: The first meeting must start after traveling from Haight-Ashbury to the friend's location.\n     - **Non-overlapping Meetings**: For any two meetings, one must start after the previous meeting ends plus travel time between locations.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n\n4. **Algorithm Selection**: The Z3 solver is used for optimization. It efficiently handles the boolean and integer constraints to find the optimal schedule.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Convert time to minutes since midnight\n    data = \"\"\"\n    Haight-Ashbury to Russian Hill: 17.\n    Haight-Ashbury to Fisherman's Wharf: 23.\n    Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill: 15.\n    Haight-Ashbury to Golden Gate Park: 7.\n    Haight-Ashbury to Alamo Square: 5.\n    Haight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights: 12.\n    Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury: 17.\n    Russian Hill to Fisherman's Wharf: 7.\n    Russian Hill to Nob Hill: 5.\n    Russian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21.\n    Russian Hill to Alamo Square: 15.\n    Russian Hill to Pacific Heights: 7.\n    Fisherman's Wharf to Haight-Ashbury: 22.\n    Fisherman's Wharf to Russian Hill: 7.\n    Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill: 11.\n    Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25.\n    Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square: 20.\n    Fisherman's Wharf to Pacific Heights: 12.\n    Nob Hill to Haight-Ashbury: 13.\n    Nob Hill to Russian Hill: 5.\n    Nob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf: 11.\n    Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park: 17.\n    Nob Hill to Alamo Square: 11.\n    Nob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8.\n    Golden Gate Park to Haight-Ashbury: 7.\n    Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19.\n    Golden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24.\n    Golden Gate Park to Nob Hill: 20.\n    Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 10.\n    Golden Gate Park to Pacific Heights: 16.\n    Alamo Square to Haight-Ashbury: 5.\n    Alamo Square to Russian Hill: 13.\n    Alamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf: 19.\n    Alamo Square to Nob Hill: 11.\n    Alamo Square to Golden Gate Park: 9.\n    Alamo Square to Pacific Heights: 10.\n    Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury: 11.\n    Pacific Heights to Russian Hill: 7.\n    Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf: 13.\n    Pacific Heights to Nob Hill: 8.\n    Pacific Heights to Golden Gate Park: 15.\n    Pacific Heights to Alamo Square: 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    travel_dict = {}\n    lines = data.strip().split('\\n')\n    for line in lines:\n        parts = line.strip().split(':')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        time_val = int(parts[1].strip().rstrip('.'))\n        locs = parts[0].split(' to ')\n        src = locs[0].strip()\n        dst = locs[1].strip()\n        if src not in travel_dict:\n            travel_dict[src] = {}\n        travel_dict[src][dst] = time_val\n\n    locations = [\n        \"Haight-Ashbury\",\n        \"Russian Hill\",\n        \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n        \"Nob Hill\",\n        \"Golden Gate Park\",\n        \"Alamo Square\",\n        \"Pacific Heights\"\n    ]\n    n = len(locations)\n    travel_time = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                travel_time[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                src = locations[i]\n                dst = locations[j]\n                travel_time[i][j] = travel_dict[src][dst]\n\n    names = [\"Dummy\", \"Stephanie\", \"Kevin\", \"Robert\", \"Steven\", \"Anthony\", \"Sandra\"]\n    available_start_min = [\n        540,   #
