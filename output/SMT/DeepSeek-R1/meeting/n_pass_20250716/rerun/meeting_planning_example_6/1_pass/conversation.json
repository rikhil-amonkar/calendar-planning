        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine a schedule that allows meeting Kenneth at Nob Hill for at least 90 minutes within his availability window (2:15 PM to 7:45 PM), starting from Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. The travel time between Fisherman's Wharf and Nob Hill is 11 minutes each way.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to schedule a visit to Nob Hill such that the meeting time with Kenneth overlaps with his availability window for at least 90 minutes. The constraints include:\n   - Starting at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM.\n   - Kenneth is available from 2:15 PM (315 minutes after 9:00 AM) to 7:45 PM (645 minutes after 9:00 AM).\n   - Travel time to Nob Hill is 11 minutes.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The meeting time is the overlap between the time spent at Nob Hill and Kenneth's availability window. This overlap must be at least 90 minutes. The time spent at Nob Hill starts when we arrive (after traveling from Fisherman's Wharf) and ends when we leave.\n\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - Let `t0` be the departure time from Fisherman's Wharf (in minutes after 9:00 AM).\n   - Arrival time at Nob Hill is `t0 + 11`.\n   - Departure time from Nob Hill is `depart_NH` (must be \u2265 arrival time).\n   - The overlap is calculated as `min(depart_NH, 645) - max(arrive_NH, 315)`, which must be \u2265 90.\n   - Additional constraints ensure the arrival is before 7:45 PM and departure after 2:15 PM.\n\n4. **Z3 Solver**: We use the Z3 solver to find values of `t0` and `depart_NH` that satisfy all constraints. The solver checks for feasible solutions and returns the first valid schedule.\n\n5. **Output**: The solution is formatted to show departure and arrival times in a human-readable format (12-hour clock with AM/PM).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the variables\n    t0 = Int('t0')   # departure time from Fisherman's Wharf (minutes after 9:00 AM)\n    depart_NH = Int('depart_NH') # departure time from Nob Hill (minutes after 9:00 AM)\n    \n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Constraints\n    s.add(t0 >= 0)  # must leave Fisherman's Wharf after 9:00 AM\n    arrive_NH = t0 + 11  # arrival time at Nob Hill\n    s.add(depart_NH >= arrive_NH)  # must leave Nob Hill after arriving\n    \n    # Kenneth's availability window: 315 to 645 minutes (2:15 PM to 7:45 PM)\n    s.add(arrive_NH <= 645)  # must arrive at Nob Hill by 7:45 PM\n    s.add(depart_NH >= 315)  # must leave Nob Hill after 2:15 PM\n    \n    # Overlap constraint: at least 90 minutes\n    overlap = Min(depart_NH, 645) - Max(arrive_NH, 315)\n    s.add(overlap >= 90)\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        t0_val = m[t0].as_long()\n        depart_NH_val = m[depart_NH].as_long()\n        arrive_NH_val = t0_val + 11\n        \n        # Function to convert minutes since 9:00 AM to formatted time string (12-hour with AM/PM)\n        def format_time(minutes_since_9am):\n            total_minutes = minutes_since_9am\n            total_hours = 9 + total_minutes // 60\n            minutes = total_minutes % 60\n            hour12 = total_hours % 12\n            if hour12 == 0:\n                hour12 = 12\n            period = \"AM\" if total_hours < 12 else \"PM\"\n            return f\"{hour12}:{minutes:02d} {period}\"\n        \n        leave_fw_time = format_time(t0_val)\n        arrive_nh_time = format_time(arrive_NH_val)\n        leave_nh_time = format_time(depart_NH_val)\n        \n        # Calculate actual meeting start and end times\n        start_meeting = max(arrive_NH_val, 315)\n        end_meeting = min(depart_NH_val, 645)\n        meeting_duration = end_meeting - start_meeting\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Leave Fisherman's Wharf at {leave_fw_time}\")\n        print(f\"Arrive at Nob Hill at {arrive_nh_time}\")\n        print(f\"Leave Nob Hill at {leave_nh_time}\")\n        print(f\"Meeting time with Kenneth: {meeting_duration} minutes (from {format_time(start_meeting)} to {format_time(end_meeting)})\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized with variables `t0` (departure time from Fisherman's Wharf) and `depart_NH` (departure time from Nob Hill).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - `t0` must be \u2265 0 (departure after 9:00 AM).\n   - Arrival at Nob Hill is `t0 + 11`.\n   - Departure from Nob Hill must be after arrival.\n   - Arrival at Nob Hill must be by 7:45 PM (645 minutes) and departure after 2:15 PM (315 minutes).\n   - The overlap between the visit and Kenneth's window must be \u2265 90 minutes.\n3. **Solution Check**: The solver checks for a feasible solution. If found, it formats the times into a readable 12-hour format and prints the schedule along with the meeting duration.\n4. **Output**: The solution includes departure and arrival times, and details of the meeting window with Kenneth.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the Z3 solver to find a feasible meeting schedule that meets all given constraints."
