        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends we can meet in San Francisco while respecting their availability windows and the travel times between different locations. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to model the constraints and find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at Bayview at 9:00 AM. Each friend has a specific location, availability window, and minimum meeting duration. Travel times between locations are provided. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible without overlapping their availability windows and accounting for travel times.\n\n2. **Modeling the Schedule**: We model the schedule using four slots (s1, s2, s3, s4), each representing a potential meeting with a friend. Each slot can either be assigned a friend or remain empty. The sequence of meetings must respect the travel times between consecutive locations.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - **Slot Validity**: Each slot must either be assigned a valid friend (1 to 4) or be marked as empty (-1).\n   - **Slot Sequencing**: If a slot is empty, all subsequent slots must also be empty.\n   - **Friend Uniqueness**: Each friend can be met at most once.\n   - **Time Windows**: The start time of each meeting must be within the friend's availability window, and the meeting must end before their window closes.\n   - **Travel Times**: The start time of the next meeting must account for the travel time from the previous meeting's location.\n   - **Initial Travel**: The first meeting must start after traveling from Bayview (starting point) to the friend's location.\n\n4. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met by summing the non-empty slots.\n\n5. **Solution Extraction**: After solving, we decode the model to get the sequence of meetings, their start and end times, and convert these times to a readable format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef min_to_time(total_minutes):\n    total_minutes = int(total_minutes)\n    hours = total_minutes // 60\n    minutes = total_minutes % 60\n    if hours == 0:\n        return f\"12:{minutes:02d} AM\"\n    elif hours < 12:\n        return f\"{hours}:{minutes:02d} AM\"\n    elif hours == 12:\n        return f\"12:{minutes:02d} PM\"\n    else:\n        return f\"{hours-12}:{minutes:02d} PM\"\n\ndef main():\n    #

Each slot can be assigned a friend (1-4) or be empty (-1).\n4. **Constraints**: \n   - **Slot Validity**: Each slot must be a valid friend or empty.\n   - **Sequencing**: Empty slots must precede all subsequent empty slots.\n   - **Uniqueness**: Each friend can be met at most once.\n   - **Time Windows**: Meetings must start and end within the friend's availability window.\n   - **Travel Times**: The start time of each meeting accounts for travel from the previous location.\n5. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met by summing non-empty slots.\n6. **Solution Extraction**: The model is decoded to produce a human-readable schedule showing travel times, meeting times, and the total number of friends met. The `min_to_time` function converts minutes to a readable time format (e.g., 540 minutes becomes \"9:00 AM\")."
