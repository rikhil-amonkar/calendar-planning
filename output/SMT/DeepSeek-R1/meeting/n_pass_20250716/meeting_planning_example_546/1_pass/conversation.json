        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met within their respective time windows while respecting travel times and meeting duration constraints. The approach involves using the Z3 solver to model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem with optimization.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We have six friends, each available at specific locations and time windows.\n   - Travel times between locations are provided.\n   - We start at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM and must schedule meetings such that each meeting lasts at least a specified minimum duration.\n   - The goal is to maximize the number of friends met.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - The problem requires scheduling meetings in a sequence where travel times between consecutive meetings are accounted for.\n   - Each meeting must start within its availability window and last for the minimum duration.\n   - The sequence of meetings must respect travel times from the starting point (Embarcadero) and between subsequent locations.\n\n3. **Modeling the Problem**:\n   - **Variables**: \n     - `meet`: Boolean variables indicating whether a friend is met.\n     - `start`: Integer variables representing the start time (in minutes from 9:00 AM) of each meeting.\n     - `before`: Boolean variables indicating the order of meetings (whether one meeting occurs before another).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - If a friend is met, their meeting must start within their availability window and last for the minimum duration.\n     - For any two meetings, one must occur before the other if both are met, and travel time between their locations must be respected.\n     - Transitivity is enforced for the ordering of meetings.\n     - The start time of each meeting must be at least the travel time from Embarcadero to the meeting location.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the sum of `meet` variables (i.e., the number of friends met).\n\n4. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - The Z3 solver is used to handle the constraints and optimization efficiently. Z3's `Optimize` class allows us to maximize the number of friends met while satisfying all constraints.\n\n5. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The problem involves O(n^2) constraints for ordering and travel times, and O(n^3) constraints for transitivity, where n is the number of friends (6 in this case). This is manageable due to the small value of n.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Travel times dictionary\ntravel_dict = {\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Richmond District'): 21,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Union Square'): 10,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Financial District'): 5,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Pacific Heights'): 11,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Nob Hill'): 10,\n    ('Embarcadero', 'Bayview'): 21,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Embarcadero'): 19,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Union Square'): 21,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Financial District'): 22,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Pacific Heights'): 10,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Nob Hill'): 17,\n    ('Richmond District', 'Bayview'): 26,\n    ('Union Square', 'Embarcadero'): 11,\n    ('Union Square', 'Richmond District'): 20,\n    ('Union Square', 'Financial District'): 9,\n    ('Union Square', 'Pacific Heights'): 15,\n    ('Union Square', 'Nob Hill'): 9,\n    ('Union Square', 'Bayview'): 15,\n    ('Financial District', 'Embarcadero'): 4,\n    ('Financial District', 'Richmond District'): 21,\n    ('Financial District', 'Union Square'): 9,\n    ('Financial District', 'Pacific Heights'): 13,\n    ('Financial District', 'Nob Hill'): 8,\n    ('Financial District', 'Bayview'): 19,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Embarcadero'): 10,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Richmond District'): 12,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Union Square'): 12,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Financial District'): 13,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Nob Hill'): 8,\n    ('Pacific Heights', 'Bayview'): 22,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Embarcadero'): 9,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Richmond District'): 14,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Union Square'): 7,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Financial District'): 9,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Pacific Heights'): 8,\n    ('Nob Hill', 'Bayview'): 19,\n    ('Bayview', 'Embarcadero'): 19,\n    ('Bayview', 'Richmond District'): 25,\n    ('Bayview', 'Union Square'): 17,\n    ('Bayview', 'Financial District'): 19,\n    ('Bayview', 'Pacific Heights'): 23,\n    ('Bayview', 'Nob Hill'): 20\n}\n\n# Friend data\nfriends = ['Kenneth', 'Lisa', 'Joshua', 'Nancy', 'Andrew', 'John']\n\nlocations = {\n    'Kenneth': 'Richmond District',\n    'Lisa': 'Union Square',\n    'Joshua': 'Financial District',\n    'Nancy': 'Pacific Heights',\n    'Andrew': 'Nob Hill',\n    'John': 'Bayview'\n}\n\nstart_avail = {\n    'Kenneth': 735,  #
