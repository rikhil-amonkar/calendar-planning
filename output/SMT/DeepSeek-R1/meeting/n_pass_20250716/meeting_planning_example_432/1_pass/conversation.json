        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while respecting their availability windows and travel times between locations. The goal is to find a feasible schedule that allows meeting as many friends as possible within the given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. Each friend has specific time windows during which they are available, and we must spend a minimum duration with each. Travel times between locations are provided.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: \n   - **Joseph**: Available from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM, requires 90 minutes. Earliest start is 9:24 AM (after travel), latest start is 4:00 PM.\n   - **Jeffrey**: Available from 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM, requires 60 minutes. Must start by 8:30 PM.\n   - **Kevin**: Available from 11:15 AM to 3:15 PM, requires 30 minutes. Must start by 2:45 PM.\n   - **Barbara**: Available from 10:30 AM to 4:30 PM, requires 15 minutes. Must start by 4:15 PM.\n   - **David**: Available from 8:15 AM to 9:00 AM. Since we start at 9:00 AM and travel time is 25 minutes, we cannot meet David.\n3. **Order Selection**: After analyzing possible sequences, the optimal order is Kevin (Mission District), Barbara (Financial District), Joseph (Fisherman's Wharf), and Jeffrey (Bayview). This order minimizes waiting times and fits all constraints.\n4. **Scheduling with Z3**: We use the Z3 solver to find start times for each meeting, ensuring:\n   - Travel times between consecutive locations are accounted for.\n   - Each meeting starts within its availability window.\n   - The minimum duration for each meeting is satisfied.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef min_to_time(total_minutes):\n    hours = 9 + total_minutes // 60\n    minutes = total_minutes % 60\n    if hours < 12:\n        return f\"{hours}:{minutes:02d} AM\"\n    elif hours == 12:\n        return f\"12:{minutes:02d} PM\"\n    else:\n        return f\"{hours - 12}:{minutes:02d} PM\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Create integer variables for start times of each meeting\n    s0 = Int('s0')  # Joseph (Fisherman's Wharf)\n    s1 = Int('s1')  # Jeffrey (Bayview)\n    s2 = Int('s2')  # Kevin (Mission District)\n    s3 = Int('s3')  # Barbara (Financial District)\n    \n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Kevin at Mission District: available from 135 to 345 minutes (11:15 AM to 3:15 PM)\n    solver.add(s2 >= 135, s2 <= 345)\n    \n    # Barbara at Financial District: after Kevin (travel time 17 minutes) and available from 90 to 435 minutes\n    solver.add(s3 >= s2 + 30 + 17, s3 >= 90, s3 <= 435)\n    \n    # Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf: after Barbara (travel time 10 minutes) and available from 24 to 420 minutes\n    solver.add(s0 >= s3 + 15 + 10, s0 >= 24, s0 <= 420)\n    \n    # Jeffrey at Bayview: after Joseph (travel time 26 minutes) and available from 510 to 690 minutes\n    solver.add(s1 >= s0 + 90 + 26, s1 >= 510, s1 <= 690)\n    \n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        s2_val = model[s2].as_long()\n        s3_val = model[s3].as_long()\n        s0_val = model[s0].as_long()\n        s1_val = model[s1].as_long()\n        \n        # Print the schedule\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Kevin at Mission District: {min_to_time(s2_val)} to {min_to_time(s2_val + 30)}\")\n        print(f\"Barbara at Financial District: {min_to_time(s3_val)} to {min_to_time(s3_val + 15)}\")\n        print(f\"Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf: {min_to_time(s0_val)} to {min_to_time(s0_val + 90)}\")\n        print(f\"Jeffrey at Bayview: {min_to_time(s1_val)} to {min_to_time(s1_val + 60)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No feasible schedule found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We define integer variables for the start times of each meeting (Joseph, Jeffrey, Kevin, Barbara).\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - **Kevin** must start between 11:15 AM (135 minutes from 9:00 AM) and 3:15 PM (345 minutes).\n   - **Barbara** must start after Kevin's meeting plus travel time (17 minutes), within her availability (10:30 AM to 4:30 PM).\n   - **Joseph** must start after Barbara's meeting plus travel time (10 minutes), within his availability (earliest 9:24 AM, latest 4:00 PM).\n   - **Jeffrey** must start after Joseph's meeting plus travel time (26 minutes), within his availability (5:30 PM to 9:30 PM).\n3. **Solution Extraction**: The Z3 solver checks for feasible start times. If found, it converts the minutes from 9:00 AM into readable time formats and prints the schedule for each meeting.\n4. **Output**: The schedule lists each friend's location with start and end times, ensuring all constraints are met.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules meetings by leveraging constraint solving to handle travel times and availability windows, maximizing the number of friends met."
