        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met in San Francisco within their respective time windows while accounting for travel times between locations. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to model the constraints and find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, each located at different districts, within their specified time windows. The constraints include travel times between districts and minimum meeting durations.\n2. **Modeling**:\n   - **Travel Time Matrix**: A 10x10 matrix (including Presidio) stores travel times between all pairs of districts.\n   - **Time Windows and Durations**: Convert each friend's availability window and minimum meeting duration into minutes from 9:00 AM.\n   - **Decision Variables**:\n     - `x[i][j]`: Boolean variable indicating travel from location `i` to `j`.\n     - `u[j]`: Integer variable representing the order in which friend `j` is met (0 if not met).\n     - `start[j]`: Real variable for the start time of meeting friend `j`.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Incoming Edges**: Each met friend must have exactly one incoming edge.\n     - **Start Node**: The start location (Presidio) has exactly one outgoing edge if any friend is met.\n     - **Order Constraints**: Ensures the sequence of meetings follows a path starting from Presidio.\n     - **Time Constraints**: Ensures meetings start within the friend's availability window and account for travel times between consecutive meetings.\n3. **Optimization**: Iterate from the maximum possible number of friends (9) down to 1, checking for a feasible schedule using Z3's solver.\n4. **Output**: If a feasible schedule is found, convert start times back to readable format and display the meeting order and times.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    #

For example, Jason's window (8:15 AM to 11:45 AM) is adjusted to start at 9:21 AM (accounting for travel from Presidio).\n3. **Z3 Variables and Constraints**:\n   - **`x[i][j]`**: Boolean variables indicating travel from location `i` to `j`.\n   - **`u[j]`**: Integer variables representing the meeting order (0 if friend `j` is not met).\n   - **`start[j]`**: Real variables for the start time of meeting friend `j`.\n   - **Constraints** ensure meetings fit within time windows, travel times are accounted for, and the schedule forms a valid path from Presidio.\n4. **Optimization**: The solver checks for feasible schedules starting from the maximum possible friends (9) down to 1, stopping at the first feasible solution.\n5. **Output**: The solution lists the meetings in order, showing start and end times for each friend met, maximizing the number of meetings within the given constraints."
