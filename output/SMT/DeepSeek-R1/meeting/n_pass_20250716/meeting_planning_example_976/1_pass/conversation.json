        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends we can meet in San Francisco within their respective time windows while accounting for travel times between locations. The solution involves using constraint programming with the Z3 solver to model the problem and find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. Each friend is available at a specific location within a time window, and we have a minimum duration we wish to spend with each. Travel times between locations are asymmetric and provided.\n2. **Modeling**:\n   - **Events**: Include a dummy event representing the start at Embarcadero (time 0) and events for each friend.\n   - **Variables**: For each friend, we have a boolean variable indicating if we meet them, and integer variables for the start and end times of the meeting.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Time Windows**: For each friend, if met, the meeting must start within their availability window and last at least the minimum duration.\n     - **Travel Times**: For any two meetings (including the start), the start time of one must be after the end time of the other plus the travel time between their locations.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (sum of boolean variables).\n3. **Solution**: Use Z3's Optimizer to solve the constraints and print the schedule for met friends.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Build

dictionary of travel times between all pairs of locations using the provided data.\n2. **Friends Data**: Defines each friend's location, availability window (converted to minutes from 9:00 AM), and minimum meeting duration.\n3. **Z3 Setup**: Initializes the Z3 optimizer, boolean variables for meeting each friend, and integer variables for meeting start and end times.\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - **Time Windows**: Ensures meetings occur within the friend's availability and last at least the minimum duration.\n   - **Travel Times**: Ensures sufficient travel time between consecutive meetings (including from the start location).\n5. **Objective**: Maximizes the number of friends met.\n6. **Solution Extraction**: Converts the solution to human-readable times and prints the schedule.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling problem with constraints and leverages Z3 to find an optimal solution, maximizing the number of friends visited within their time windows while respecting travel times."
