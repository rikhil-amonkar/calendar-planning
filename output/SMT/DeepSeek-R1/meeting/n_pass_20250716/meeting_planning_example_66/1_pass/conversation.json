        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal times to leave Nob Hill, arrive at Presidio, and leave Presidio to meet Robert for at least 120 minutes while considering the travel times and Robert's availability. The goal is to maximize the departure time from Nob Hill to minimize waiting time at Presidio.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n   - Robert is available at Presidio from 11:15 AM to 5:45 PM.\n   - Travel time from Nob Hill to Presidio is 17 minutes, and from Presidio to Nob Hill is 18 minutes (though returning is not required).\n   - Must meet Robert for at least 120 minutes within his availability window.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - Convert all times to minutes from 9:00 AM for easier calculations.\n   - Robert's availability: 11:15 AM (135 minutes) to 5:45 PM (525 minutes).\n   - The meeting duration is the overlap between your stay at Presidio and Robert's availability, which must be at least 120 minutes.\n   - To minimize waiting time at Presidio, maximize the departure time from Nob Hill.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Use the Z3 solver to model the constraints and find an optimal schedule.\n   - Define variables for departure times from Nob Hill (`depart_NH`) and Presidio (`depart_P`).\n   - Calculate arrival time at Presidio as `depart_NH + 17`.\n   - Ensure the meeting duration (overlap between your stay and Robert's availability) is at least 120 minutes.\n   - Maximize `depart_NH` to leave Nob Hill as late as possible, reducing waiting time.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The problem involves linear constraints and integer variables, which Z3 handles efficiently.\n   - The solution is derived in polynomial time relative to the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef min_to_time(mins_after_9am):\n    total_mins = mins_after_9am\n    hours = total_mins // 60\n    minutes = total_mins % 60\n    abs_hour = 9 + hours\n    period = \"AM\" if abs_hour < 12 else \"PM\"\n    hour12 = (abs_hour - 1) % 12 + 1\n    return f\"{hour12}:{minutes:02d}{period}\"\n\n# Create the variables\ndepart_NH = Int('depart_NH')\ndepart_P = Int('depart_P')\n\n# Create the optimizer\nopt = Optimize()\n\n# Arrival time at Presidio\narrive_P = depart_NH + 17\n\n# Constraints\nopt.add(depart_NH >= 0)\nopt.add(depart_P >= arrive_P)\n\n# Meeting duration constraints\nstart_meeting = If(arrive_P < 135, 135, arrive_P)\nend_meeting = If(depart_P > 525, 525, depart_P)\nmeeting_duration = end_meeting - start_meeting\nopt.add(meeting_duration >= 120)\n\n# Objective: maximize depart_NH to leave as late as possible\nopt.maximize(depart_NH)\n\nif opt.check() == sat:\n    m = opt.model()\n    depart_NH_val = m.eval(depart_NH).as_long()\n    depart_P_val = m.eval(depart_P).as_long()\n    arrive_P_val = depart_NH_val + 17\n\n    print(\"Leave Nob Hill at:\", min_to_time(depart_NH_val))\n    print(\"Arrive at Presidio at:\", min_to_time(arrive_P_val))\n    print(\"Leave Presidio at:\", min_to_time(depart_P_val))\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `min_to_time` function converts minutes past 9:00 AM into a readable 12-hour format (e.g., 135 minutes becomes 11:15 AM).\n2. **Z3 Variables**: \n   - `depart_NH`: Time (in minutes) to leave Nob Hill.\n   - `depart_P`: Time (in minutes) to leave Presidio.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - Departure from Nob Hill must be after 9:00 AM (`depart_NH >= 0`).\n   - Departure from Presidio must be after arrival (`depart_P >= arrive_P`).\n   - Meeting duration must be at least 120 minutes within Robert's availability (11:15 AM to 5:45 PM).\n4. **Optimization**: Maximize `depart_NH` to leave Nob Hill as late as possible, ensuring minimal waiting at Presidio.\n5. **Output**: The solution prints the optimal schedule for leaving Nob Hill, arriving at Presidio, and leaving Presidio, formatted in AM/PM time.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules the meeting with Robert by leveraging constraint solving and optimization, ensuring the solution meets all given constraints while minimizing waiting time."
