        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while respecting their availability windows, meeting duration requirements, and travel times between locations. The solution involves using constraint programming with the Z3 solver to model the problem and find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to meet as many friends as possible given their specific availability windows and required meeting durations. Travel times between different locations must be considered, and the schedule must start from Union Square at 9:00 AM.\n2. **Data Preparation**: Convert all time constraints into minutes relative to 9:00 AM (time 0). Build a dictionary of travel times between all pairs of locations.\n3. **Z3 Variables**: For each friend, define:\n   - A boolean variable indicating whether the friend is met.\n   - An integer variable representing the order in which the friend is visited (0 if not visited).\n   - An integer variable for the start time of the meeting.\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Constraints**: If a friend is met, their meeting must start within their availability window and last at least the required duration.\n   - **Order Constraints**: The orders of visited friends must be distinct and form a sequence starting from 1.\n   - **Travel Constraints**: \n     - For the first friend visited, the start time must be at least the travel time from Union Square.\n     - For subsequent friends, the start time must account for the previous meeting's end time plus travel time from the previous location.\n5. **Optimization Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met by summing the boolean variables.\n6. **Solution Extraction**: After solving, print the schedule of meetings, including the order, friend's name, start time, and end time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import

Friend details, including their availability windows and meeting durations, are converted into minutes relative to 9:00 AM.\n2. **Z3 Setup**: The solver uses boolean variables to determine if a friend is met, integer variables for the meeting order, and integer variables for meeting start times.\n3. **Constraints**: \n   - Each meeting must fit within the friend's availability window.\n   - The meeting order must be unique for visited friends.\n   - The first meeting must account for travel time from Union Square.\n   - Subsequent meetings must account for travel time from the previous meeting location.\n4. **Optimization**: The solver maximizes the number of friends met by summing the boolean variables.\n5. **Output**: The solution prints the schedule of meetings in chronological order, showing the friend's name, location, and start/end times in HH:MM format.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules meetings while respecting all constraints, ensuring the maximum number of friends are met during the day."
