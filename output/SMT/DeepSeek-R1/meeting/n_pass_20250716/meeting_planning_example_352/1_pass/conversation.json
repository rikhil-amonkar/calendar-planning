        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while adhering to their availability windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times between locations. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to model the constraints and optimize the schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to schedule meetings with friends at different locations in San Francisco, starting from Union Square at 9:00 AM. Each friend has specific availability windows and minimum meeting durations. Travel times between locations are provided.\n2. **Key Constraints**:\n   - **Start Time**: Begin at Union Square at 9:00 AM (time = 0 minutes).\n   - **Friend Availability**:\n     - Sandra (Chinatown): 7:15 AM to 7:15 PM (meeting duration 75 minutes).\n     - Joseph (Haight-Ashbury): 12:30 PM to 7:45 PM (meeting duration 90 minutes).\n     - Nancy (Marina District): 11:00 AM to 8:15 PM (meeting duration 105 minutes).\n     - Karen (Nob Hill): 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM (meeting duration 30 minutes, fixed start at 9:15 PM).\n   - **Travel Times**: Asymmetric travel times between locations.\n3. **Optimization Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n4. **Modeling with Z3**:\n   - **Boolean Variables**: Represent whether each friend is met (`meet_S`, `meet_J`, etc.).\n   - **Real Variables**: Represent the start times of meetings (`start_S`, `start_J`, etc.).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Travel Time from Start**: If a friend is met, their start time must be at least the travel time from Union Square to their location.\n     - **Availability Windows**: Meetings must start within the friend's availability window and end before the window closes.\n     - **Fixed Start for Karen**: If Karen is met, her meeting must start exactly at 9:15 PM.\n     - **Pairwise Constraints**: For any two friends met, either one meeting must end and travel to the next location before the next meeting starts.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the sum of boolean variables indicating which friends are met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    #
