        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends we can meet in a day while respecting their availability windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times between locations. The approach involves modeling the problem as a constraint optimization problem using the Z3 solver, which efficiently handles constraints and objectives to find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Locations and Friends**: Each friend is at a specific location with a defined availability window and minimum meeting duration.\n   - **Travel Times**: Asymmetric travel times between locations are provided.\n   - **Constraints**: \n     - Start at Chinatown at 9:00 AM (time 0).\n     - Each meeting must start within the friend's availability window and last at least the specified duration.\n     - Travel times between consecutive meetings must be accounted for.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n\n2. **Modeling**:\n   - **Variables**:\n     - `meet[i]`: Boolean indicating if friend `i` is met.\n     - `start[i]`: Real-valued start time of meeting with friend `i`.\n     - `end[i]`: Real-valued end time of meeting with friend `i` (computed as `start[i] + duration[i]`).\n     - `before[i][j]`: Boolean indicating if meeting `i` occurs before meeting `j`.\n     - `first[i]`: Boolean indicating if meeting `i` is the first in the schedule.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Meeting Windows**: For each friend, if met, the meeting must fit within their availability window.\n     - **Ordering**: For any two meetings, one must precede the other if both are met.\n     - **Transitivity**: If meeting `i` is before `j` and `j` before `k`, then `i` must be before `k`.\n     - **First Meeting**: The first meeting must start after traveling from Chinatown.\n     - **Consecutive Meetings**: The start time of a meeting must be at least the end time of the previous meeting plus travel time.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the sum of `meet[i]` across all friends.\n\n3. **Solution Extraction**:\n   - Use Z3's Optimize solver to maximize the number of meetings.\n   - Extract and print the schedule if a solution exists.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    #
