        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while adhering to the given constraints. The goal is to meet both Karen and Mark for their required minimum durations within their availability windows, considering the travel times between locations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: All times are converted into minutes from midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Define Constraints**:\n   - **Start Time**: You begin at North Beach at 9:00 AM (540 minutes).\n   - **Mark's Availability**: Mark is available from 1:00 PM (780 minutes) to 5:45 PM (1065 minutes). You need to meet him for at least 120 minutes.\n   - **Karen's Availability**: Karen is available from 6:45 PM (1125 minutes) to 8:15 PM (1215 minutes). You need to meet her for at least 90 minutes.\n   - **Travel Times**: \n     - North Beach to Embarcadero: 6 minutes.\n     - Embarcadero to Pacific Heights: 11 minutes.\n3. **Decision Variables**:\n   - `start_Mark`: The start time of the meeting with Mark.\n   - `t_leave_NB`: The time you leave North Beach.\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting with Mark must start within his availability window and last 120 minutes.\n   - You must leave North Beach after 9:00 AM and arrive at Embarcadero by the start of Mark's meeting.\n   - After meeting Mark, you must travel to Pacific Heights and arrive by 6:45 PM to meet Karen.\n5. **Optimization**: Maximize the start time of the meeting with Mark to minimize waiting time before meeting Karen.\n6. **Output**: Convert the solution back to a readable time format and print the schedule.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Convert times to minutes from midnight\n    start_day = 9 * 60  # 9:00 AM\n    mark_start_avail = 13 * 60      # 1:00 PM (780 minutes)\n    mark_end_avail = 17 * 60 + 45   # 5:45 PM (1065 minutes)\n    karen_start = 18 * 60 + 45      # 6:45 PM (1125 minutes)\n    karen_end = 20 * 60 + 15        # 8:15 PM (1215 minutes)\n\n    # Travel times\n    NB_to_Emb = 6    # North Beach to Embarcadero\n    Emb_to_PH = 11   # Embarcadero to Pacific Heights\n\n    # Create optimizer\n    opt = Optimize()\n\n    # Define variables\n    start_Mark = Int('start_Mark')\n    t_leave_NB = Int('t_leave_NB')\n\n    # Constraints for Mark's meeting\n    opt.add(start_Mark >= mark_start_avail)\n    opt.add(start_Mark + 120 <= mark_end_avail)\n    \n    # Travel from North Beach to Embarcadero\n    opt.add(t_leave_NB >= start_day)\n    opt.add(t_leave_NB + NB_to_Emb <= start_Mark)\n    \n    # Travel to Pacific Heights for Karen\n    opt.add(start_Mark + 120 + Emb_to_PH <= karen_start)\n    \n    # Maximize start_Mark to minimize waiting time before Karen\n    opt.maximize(start_Mark)\n\n    if opt.check() == sat:\n        m = opt.model()\n        start_mark_val = m.evaluate(start_Mark).as_long()\n        t_leave_NB_val = m.evaluate(t_leave_NB).as_long()\n        \n        def format_time(minutes):\n            hours = minutes // 60\n            mins = minutes % 60\n            am_pm = \"AM\" if hours < 12 else \"PM\"\n            display_hour = hours % 12\n            if display_hour == 0:\n                display_hour = 12\n            return f\"{display_hour}:{mins:02d}{am_pm}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Leave North Beach at {format_time(t_leave_NB_val)}\")\n        print(f\"Arrive at Embarcadero at {format_time(t_leave_NB_val + NB_to_Emb)}\")\n        print(f\"Meet Mark from {format_time(start_mark_val)} to {format_time(start_mark_val + 120)}\")\n        print(f\"Leave Embarcadero at {format_time(start_mark_val + 120)}\")\n        print(f\"Arrive at Pacific Heights at {format_time(start_mark_val + 120 + Emb_to_PH)}\")\n        print(f\"Meet Karen from {format_time(karen_start)} to {format_time(karen_end)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All times are converted into minutes past midnight for simplicity in calculations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**:\n   - **Mark's Meeting**: Must start between 1:00 PM and 3:45 PM (since the meeting lasts 120 minutes and must end by 5:45 PM).\n   - **Travel Constraints**: \n     - You leave North Beach at least 6 minutes before meeting Mark to arrive on time.\n     - After meeting Mark, you travel 11 minutes to Pacific Heights, arriving by 6:45 PM to meet Karen.\n3. **Optimization**: The start time of Mark's meeting is maximized to reduce waiting time before meeting Karen.\n4. **Output**: The solution is formatted into a readable schedule, showing departure and arrival times, and meeting durations.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules meetings with both friends while respecting all constraints and minimizing idle time."
