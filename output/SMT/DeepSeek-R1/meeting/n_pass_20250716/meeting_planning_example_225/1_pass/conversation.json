        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while adhering to their availability constraints and travel times between locations. The goal is to find the optimal schedule that allows meeting as many friends as possible, considering the minimum meeting durations and travel times.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Locations**: Friends are located at North Beach (Sarah), Union Square (Jeffrey), and Alamo Square (Brian). The day starts at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.\n   - **Constraints**: Each friend has specific availability windows and minimum meeting durations:\n     - Sarah: 4:00 PM to 6:15 PM (75 minutes), minimum 60 minutes.\n     - Jeffrey: 3:00 PM to 10:00 PM (7 hours), minimum 75 minutes.\n     - Brian: 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM (90 minutes), minimum 75 minutes.\n   - **Travel Times**: Predefined travel times between all pairs of locations, including from Sunset District to each friend's location.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: \n   - Meeting all three friends is infeasible due to overlapping time constraints and travel times. For instance, meeting Brian requires ending by 5:30 PM, leaving insufficient time to meet Sarah afterward.\n   - The optimal solution involves meeting two friends. The best pairs are either Jeffrey and Sarah or Jeffrey and Brian. Meeting Jeffrey and Brian maximizes the total meeting time (150 minutes) compared to Jeffrey and Sarah (135 minutes).\n\n3. **Modeling with Z3**:\n   - **Variables**: \n     - Boolean variables for whether each friend is met (`s_met`, `j_met`, `b_met`).\n     - Integer variables for the start times of each meeting (`s_start`, `j_start`, `b_start`).\n     - Integer variables for the order of meetings (`s_order`, `j_order`, `b_order`).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Availability and Duration**: If a friend is met, their start time must be within their availability window, and the meeting must last at least the minimum duration.\n     - **Travel Time from Start**: The start time of the first meeting must account for travel time from Sunset District.\n     - **Order and Travel Between Meetings**: For any two friends met, their meetings must be ordered, with travel time between locations accounted for.\n     - **Order Consistency**: Each meeting must have a unique order index if met.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the sum of friends met (`s_met + j_met + b_met`).\n\n4. **Solution Extraction**:\n   - Use Z3's optimizer to find the schedule that meets the maximum number of friends.\n   - Convert start times from minutes (since 9:00 AM) to readable time format.\n   - Output the schedule for the met friends.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Travel time dictionary\n    travel_dict = {\n        ('start', 'north'): 29,\n        ('start', 'union'): 30,\n        ('start', 'alamo'): 17,\n        ('north', 'start'): 27,\n        ('north', 'union'): 7,\n        ('north', 'alamo'): 16,\n        ('union', 'start'): 26,\n        ('union', 'north'): 10,\n        ('union', 'alamo'): 15,\n        ('alamo', 'start'): 16,\n        ('alamo', 'north'): 15,\n        ('alamo', 'union'): 14,\n    }\n\n    # Friend data: (name, location, availability start, availability end, duration)\n    # Times in minutes from 9:00 AM\n    friends_data = [\n        ('s', 'north', 7*60, 9*60 + 15, 60),  # Sarah: 4:00 PM to 6:15 PM, 60 min\n        ('j', 'union', 6*60, 13*60, 75),       # Jeffrey: 3:00 PM to 10:00 PM, 75 min\n        ('b', 'alamo', 7*60, 8*60 + 30, 75)    # Brian: 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM, 75 min (must start by 4:15 PM)\n    ]\n\n    s_met, j_met, b_met = Bools('s_met j_met b_met')\n    s_start, j_start, b_start = Ints('s_start j_start b_start')\n    s_order, j_order, b_order = Ints('s_order j_order b_order')\n\n    # Friend variables for easy iteration\n    friends = [\n        ('s', s_met, s_start, s_order, 'north', friends_data[0][2], friends_data[0][3], friends_data[0][4]),\n        ('j', j_met, j_start, j_order, 'union', friends_data[1][2], friends_data[1][3], friends_data[1][4]),\n        ('b', b_met, b_start, b_order, 'alamo', friends_data[2][2], friends_data[2][3], friends_data[2][4])\n    ]\n\n    solver = Optimize()\n    constraints = []\n\n    # Individual meeting constraints\n    for name, met, start, order, loc, avail_low, avail_high, dur in friends:\n        constraints.append(If(met, \n                             And(start >= avail_low, \n                                 start <= avail_high -

Boolean variables (`s_met`, `j_met`, `b_met`) determine if each friend is met.\n   - Integer variables (`s_start`, `j_start`, `b_start`) represent meeting start times.\n   - Order variables (`s_order`, `j_order`, `b_order`) ensure meetings are scheduled in a feasible sequence.\n   - Constraints enforce availability, minimum durations, travel times, and order consistency.\n4. **Optimization**: The solver maximizes the number of friends met by evaluating all feasible schedules.\n5. **Output**: The solution prints the schedule for met friends, converting start times to readable format, and the total number of friends met.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling problem using Z3's optimization capabilities to find the best possible schedule for meeting friends while respecting all constraints."
