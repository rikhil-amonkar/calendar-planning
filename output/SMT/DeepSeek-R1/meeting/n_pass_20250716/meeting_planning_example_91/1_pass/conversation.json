        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal departure time from Russian Hill that allows us to meet Daniel in the Richmond District for at least 75 minutes during his availability window (7:00 PM to 8:15 PM). The key constraints are:\n1. We start at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel time from Russian Hill to Richmond District is 14 minutes.\n3. Daniel is available from 7:00 PM (600 minutes after 9:00 AM) to 8:15 PM (675 minutes after 9:00 AM).\n4. We must meet Daniel for at least 75 minutes, which requires being present for his entire availability window.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to meet Daniel for the full 75 minutes. Since his window is exactly 75 minutes long, we must arrive at Richmond District by 7:00 PM and stay until at least 8:15 PM.\n2. **Key Insight**: To arrive by 7:00 PM, the departure time from Russian Hill must be such that the arrival time (departure time + 14 minutes) is \u2264 600 minutes (7:00 PM) after 9:00 AM.\n3. **Constraints Handling**: The departure time must be non-negative (since we start at 9:00 AM) and satisfy the arrival time constraint.\n4. **Solution Generation**: Using the Z3 solver, we model the departure time as an integer variable and add the constraints. The solver finds a valid departure time that meets all conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Departure time from Russian Hill (minutes after 9:00 AM)\n    depart_RH = Int('depart_RH')\n    \n    # Constraints\n    s.add(depart_RH >= 0)  # Departure time cannot be negative\n    s.add(depart_RH + 14 <= 600)  # Must arrive by 7:00 PM (600 minutes after 9:00 AM)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        depart_val = m[depart_RH].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes to time format\n        total_minutes = depart_val\n        hours = total_minutes // 60\n        minutes = total_minutes % 60\n        total_hours = 9 + hours  # Starting from 9:00 AM\n        \n        # Convert to 12-hour format with AM/PM\n        if total_hours >= 12:\n            suffix = \"PM\"\n            if total_hours > 12:\n                total_hours -= 12\n        else:\n            suffix = \"AM\"\n        \n        print(f\"Depart Russian Hill at {total_hours}:{minutes:02d} {suffix}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No valid schedule found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle the constraints.\n2. **Variable Definition**: `depart_RH` represents the departure time from Russian Hill in minutes after 9:00 AM.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - `depart_RH >= 0`: Ensures departure time is not before 9:00 AM.\n   - `depart_RH + 14 <= 600`: Ensures arrival at Richmond District by 7:00 PM (600 minutes after 9:00 AM).\n4. **Solution Check**: The solver checks for a valid solution. If found, it converts the departure time from minutes to a readable 12-hour format (HH:MM AM/PM).\n5. **Output**: The solution prints the departure time from Russian Hill that allows meeting Daniel for the required duration.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem constraints using Z3 to find a valid departure time, ensuring we meet Daniel for the full 75 minutes during his availability window."
