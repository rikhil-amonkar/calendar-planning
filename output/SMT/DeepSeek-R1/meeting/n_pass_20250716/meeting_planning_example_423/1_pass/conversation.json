        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while respecting their availability windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times between locations. The solution involves using constraint programming with the Z3 solver to model the problem and find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to meet as many friends as possible given their fixed availability windows and minimum meeting durations. Travel times between different locations must be considered when moving from one meeting to the next. The day starts at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n\n2. **Key Constraints**:\n   - **Travel Times**: Predefined travel times between all pairs of locations.\n   - **Friend Availability**: Each friend has specific time windows during which they can be met.\n   - **Meeting Durations**: Each friend requires a minimum meeting duration.\n   - **Start Location**: The journey begins at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n\n3. **Modeling**:\n   - **Variables**:\n     - `active[i]`: Boolean indicating whether friend `i` is met.\n     - `start[i]`: Integer representing the start time (in minutes from 9:00 AM) of the meeting with friend `i`.\n     - `end[i]`: Integer representing the end time of the meeting with friend `i`.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - If a friend is met, their meeting must start after the travel time from Presidio to their location.\n     - If a friend is met, their meeting must occur within their availability window.\n     - The meeting duration must be at least the minimum required.\n     - For any two friends met, their meetings must not overlap considering travel time between their locations (disjunctive constraint).\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n\n4. **Algorithm Selection**: The Z3 solver is used to handle the constraints and optimize the objective function. The problem is modeled using integer and boolean variables with linear constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Travel time matrix: [Presidio, Richmond, NorthBeach, Financial, GoldenGate, UnionSquare]\n    travel = [\n        [0, 7, 18, 23, 12, 22],     # From Presidio\n        [7, 0, 17, 22, 9, 21],      # From Richmond\n        [17, 18, 0, 8, 22, 7],      # From NorthBeach\n        [22, 21, 7, 0, 23, 9],      # From Financial\n        [11, 7, 24, 26, 0, 22],     # From GoldenGate\n        [24, 20, 10, 9, 22, 0]      # From UnionSquare\n    ]\n\n    friends = [\n        # (name, loc_index, avail_start, avail_end, min_duration, travel_from_presidio)\n        ('Jason', 1, 240, 705, 90, travel[0][1]),\n        ('Melissa', 2, 585, 675, 45, travel[0][2]),\n        ('Brian', 3, 45, 765, 15, travel[0][3]),\n        ('Elizabeth', 4, -15, 750, 105, travel[0][4]),\n        ('Laura', 5, 315, 630, 75, travel[0][5])\n    ]\n\n    n = len(friends)\n    active = [Bool(f[0]) for f in friends]\n    start = [Int(f'start_{f[0]}') for f in friends]\n    end = [Int(f'end_{f[0]}') for f in friends]\n\n    s = Optimize()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        name, loc_idx, avail_s, avail_e, dur, travel_p = friends[i]\n        # If meeting the friend, start time must be at least travel time from Presidio\n        s.add(Implies(active[i], start[i] >= travel_p))\n        # If availability start time is non-negative, start time must be at least that\n        if avail_s >= 0:\n            s.add(Implies(active[i], start[i] >= avail_s))\n        # Meeting duration constraint\n        s.add(Implies(active[i], end[i] == start[i] + dur))\n        # End time must be within friend's availability window\n        s.add(Implies(active[i], end[i] <= avail_e))\n\n    # Disjunctive constraints for every pair of friends\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            name_i, loc_i, _, _, _, _ = friends[i]\n            name_j, loc_j, _, _, _, _ = friends[j]\n            T_ij = travel[loc_i][loc_j]\n            T_ji = travel[loc_j][loc_i]\n            s.add(Implies(\n                And(active[i], active[j]),\n                Or(end[i] + T_ij <= start[j], end[j] + T_ji <= start[i])\n            ))\n\n    obj = Sum([If(active[i], 1, 0) for i in range(n)])\n    s.maximize(obj)\n\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        active_friends = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            if m.evaluate(active[i]):\n                name = friends[i][0]\n                start_val = m.evaluate(start[i])\n                end_val = m.evaluate(end[i])\n                if isinstance(start_val, IntNumRef) and isinstance(end_val, IntNumRef):\n                    start_min = start_val.as_long()\n                    end_min = end_val.as_long()\n                    start_hour = 9 + start_min // 60\n                    start_minute = start_min % 60\n                    end_hour = 9 + end_min // 60\n                    end_minute = end_min % 60\n                    start_str = f\"{start_hour}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n                    end_str = f\"{end_hour}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n                    active_friends.append((name, start_str, end_str))\n        print(\"We meet the following friends:\")\n        for name, st, et in active_friends:\n            print(f\"{name}: from {st} to {et}\")\n        print(f\"Total: {len(active_friends)} friends\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Travel Time Matrix**: A 6x6 matrix defines travel times between all pairs of locations (including Presidio and the five friend locations).\n2. **Friend Data**: Each friend's data includes their name, location index, availability window (start and end times in minutes from 9:00 AM), minimum meeting duration, and travel time from Presidio.\n3. **Z3 Variables and Constraints**:\n   - **Active Variables**: Boolean variables indicating whether a friend is met.\n   - **Start and End Variables**: Integer variables representing meeting start and end times.\n   - **Constraints**: Ensure meetings fit within availability windows, meet minimum durations, and account for travel times between consecutive meetings.\n4. **Disjunctive Constraints**: For any two friends met, their meetings must not overlap considering the travel time between their locations.\n5. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n6. **Output**: The solution prints the schedule for each friend met, showing start and end times, and the total number of friends met.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling problem using constraint programming to find an optimal solution that maximizes the number of friends visited while respecting all constraints."
