        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while respecting their availability constraints and travel times between locations. The approach involves using the Z3 solver to check feasible schedules for meeting friends in different orders, starting with meeting all three friends, then two, and finally one if necessary.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling meetings with three friends at different locations in San Francisco. Each friend has specific availability windows, and we must meet them for a minimum duration. Travel times between locations are provided. The goal is to maximize the number of friends met within their constraints.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible permutations of meeting orders (3! = 6 for three friends) to see if a valid schedule exists. If no valid schedule is found for three friends, we check combinations of two friends (3 pairs with 2 orders each), and finally individual friends.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use the Z3 solver to model the constraints for each permutation. For each candidate order, we define start times for meetings and enforce constraints:\n   - Start time after travel time from the previous location.\n   - Meeting must occur within the friend's availability window.\n   - Meeting duration must meet the minimum required time.\n4. **Optimization**: By iterating through permutations in a specific order (all three, then two, then one), we ensure the solution maximizes the number of friends met. The first valid schedule found is chosen as the solution.\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach checks 6 permutations for three friends, 6 for two friends (3 pairs \u00d7 2 orders), and 3 for one friend. Each check involves solving a linear arithmetic problem with Z3, which is efficient for small problem sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nfrom itertools import permutations, combinations\n\nclass Friend:\n    def __init__(self, name, location, avail_start, avail_end, min_time):\n        self.name = name\n        self.location = location\n        self.avail_start = avail_start\n        self.avail_end = avail_end\n        self.min_time = min_time\n\ndef main():\n    travel_time_dict = {\n        \"FW\": {\"GGP\": 25, \"P\": 17, \"RD\": 18},\n        \"GGP\": {\"FW\": 24, \"P\": 11, \"RD\": 7},\n        \"P\": {\"FW\": 19, \"GGP\": 12, \"RD\": 7},\n        \"RD\": {\"FW\": 18, \"GGP\": 9, \"P\": 7}\n    }\n    \n    M = Friend(\"Melissa\", \"GGP\", -30, 660, 15)\n    E = Friend(\"Emily\", \"RD\", 465, 780, 120)\n    N = Friend(\"Nancy\", \"P\", 645, 780, 105)\n    all_friends = [M, E, N]\n    \n    best_count = 0\n    best_schedule = None\n    best_order = None\n    \n    # Try meeting all three friends\n    found_three = False\n    for perm in permutations(all_friends):\n        s = Solver()\n        T0, T1, T2 = Reals('T0 T1 T2')\n        loc0 = perm[0].location\n        travel0 = travel_time_dict[\"FW\"][loc0]\n        s.add(T0 >= travel0, T0 >= perm[0].avail_start, T0 + perm[0].min_time <= perm[0].avail_end)\n        \n        loc1 = perm[1].location\n        travel1 = travel_time_dict[loc0][loc1]\n        s.add(T1 >= T0 + perm[0].min_time + travel1, T1 >= perm[1].avail_start, T1 + perm[1].min_time <= perm[1].avail_end)\n        \n        loc2 = perm[2].location\n        travel2 = travel_time_dict[loc1][loc2]\n        s.add(T2 >= T1 + perm[1].min_time + travel2, T2 >= perm[2].avail_start, T2 + perm[2].min_time <= perm[2].avail_end)\n        \n        if s.check() == sat:\n            m = s.model()\n            times = [m[T0].as_fraction(), m[T1].as_fraction(), m[T2].as_fraction()]\n            best_count = 3\n            best_schedule = times\n            best_order = perm\n            found_three = True\n            break\n    \n    if not found_three:\n        found_two = False\n        for combo in combinations(all_friends, 2):\n            for perm in permutations(combo):\n                s = Solver()\n                T0, T1 = Reals('T0 T1')\n                loc0 = perm[0].location\n                travel0 = travel_time_dict[\"FW\"][loc0]\n                s.add(T0 >= travel0, T0 >= perm[0].avail_start, T0 + perm[0].min_time <= perm[0].avail_end)\n                \n                loc1 = perm[1].location\n                travel1 = travel_time_dict[loc0][loc1]\n                s.add(T1 >= T0 + perm[0].min_time + travel1, T1 >= perm[1].avail_start, T1 + perm[1].min_time <= perm[1].avail_end)\n                \n                if s.check() == sat:\n                    m = s.model()\n                    times = [m[T0].as_fraction(), m[T1].as_fraction()]\n                    best_count = 2\n                    best_schedule = times\n                    best_order = perm\n                    found_two = True\n                    break\n            if found_two:\n                break\n        \n        if not found_two:\n            for friend in all_friends:\n                s = Solver()\n                T0 = Real('T0')\n                loc0 = friend.location\n                travel0 = travel_time_dict[\"FW\"][loc0]\n                s.add(T0 >= travel0, T0 >= friend.avail_start, T0 + friend.min_time <= friend.avail_end)\n                if s.check() == sat:\n                    m = s.model()\n                    time0 = m[T0].as_fraction()\n                    best_count = 1\n                    best_schedule = [time0]\n                    best_order = [friend]\n                    break\n    \n    print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n    if best_count == 3:\n        print(f\"Start at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM.\")\n        for i in range(3):\n            friend = best_order[i]\n            start_time = float(best_schedule[i])\n            total_minutes = start_time\n            abs_hour = 9 + int(total_minutes) // 60\n            abs_minute = int(total_minutes) % 60\n            if abs_hour >= 13:\n                hour_str = str(abs_hour -

The `travel_time_dict` holds travel times between locations.\n2. **Meeting All Three Friends**: The code checks all permutations of the three friends to find a valid schedule where each meeting fits within the friend's availability window and travel times are accounted for.\n3. **Meeting Two Friends**: If meeting all three is impossible, the code checks pairs of friends in both possible orders to find a feasible schedule for two.\n4. **Meeting One Friend**: If no two-friend schedule works, the code checks each friend individually to ensure at least one meeting.\n5. **Output**: The solution prints the schedule starting from Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM, detailing travel and meeting times for each friend met, formatted in AM/PM.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores possible schedules using Z3's constraint-solving capabilities to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints."
