        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine a schedule that allows us to meet David at Chinatown for at least 105 minutes during his availability window (4:00 PM to 9:45 PM). We start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM and must account for travel times between locations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We start at Golden Gate Park (GGP) at 9:00 AM (540 minutes from midnight).\n   - David is available at Chinatown (CT) from 4:00 PM (960 minutes) to 9:45 PM (1305 minutes).\n   - Travel time from GGP to CT is 23 minutes.\n   - We need to be at CT for at least 105 minutes during David's availability window.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The meeting duration is the overlap between the time we are at CT and David's availability window.\n   - We must leave GGP at a time \\( T1 \\) such that we arrive at CT (\\( T1 + 23 \\)) before or during David's window.\n   - We leave CT at time \\( T2 \\), ensuring the overlap between \\([ \\max(T1 + 23, 960), \\min(T2, 1305) ]\\) is at least 105 minutes.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - \\( T1 \\geq 540 \\) (since we start at GGP at 9:00 AM).\n   - \\( T2 \\geq T1 + 23 \\) (travel time to CT).\n   - \\( \\min(T2, 1305) - \\max(T1 + 23, 960) \\geq 105 \\).\n\n4. **Solution**:\n   - Use Z3 solver to find integer values \\( T1 \\) (departure time from GGP) and \\( T2 \\) (departure time from CT) that satisfy the constraints.\n   - Convert the solution times from minutes back to a readable time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    T1 = Int('T1')  # Time leaving Golden Gate Park (in minutes from midnight)\n    T2 = Int('T2')  # Time leaving Chinatown (in minutes from midnight)\n    \n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Constraints\n    s.add(T1 >= 540)  # Must leave GGP after 9:00 AM\n    s.add(T2 >= T1 + 23)  # Travel time to Chinatown is 23 minutes\n    \n    # Calculate the start and end of the meeting window\n    start_meeting = If(T1 + 23 >= 960, T1 + 23, 960)\n    end_meeting = If(T2 <= 1305, T2, 1305)\n    \n    # Ensure meeting duration is at least 105 minutes\n    s.add(end_meeting - start_meeting >= 105)\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        t1_val = m.eval(T1).as_long()\n        t2_val = m.eval(T2).as_long()\n        arr_val = t1_val + 23  # Arrival time at Chinatown\n        \n        # Helper function to convert minutes to time string\n        def min_to_time(minutes):\n            hours = minutes // 60\n            mins = minutes % 60\n            if hours >= 12:\n                period = \"PM\"\n                if hours > 12:\n                    hours -= 12\n            else:\n                period = \"AM\"\n                if hours == 0:\n                    hours = 12\n            return f\"{hours}:{mins:02d} {period}\"\n        \n        time_leave_ggp = min_to_time(t1_val)\n        time_arrive_ct = min_to_time(arr_val)\n        time_leave_ct = min_to_time(t2_val)\n        \n        # Output the schedule\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Leave Golden Gate Park at {time_leave_ggp}.\")\n        print(f\"Arrive at Chinatown at {time_arrive_ct}.\")\n        print(f\"Leave Chinatown at {time_leave_ct}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No valid schedule found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Define integer variables \\( T1 \\) (time leaving GGP) and \\( T2 \\) (time leaving CT) for the Z3 solver.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - \\( T1 \\) must be at least 540 (9:00 AM).\n   - \\( T2 \\) must be at least \\( T1 + 23 \\) (accounting for travel time to CT).\n   - The meeting duration is calculated as the difference between the end of the meeting window (minimum of \\( T2 \\) and 9:45 PM) and the start of the meeting window (maximum of arrival time at CT and 4:00 PM). This duration must be at least 105 minutes.\n\n3. **Solution Extraction**:\n   - If a solution exists, convert \\( T1 \\) and \\( T2 \\) from minutes to readable time formats.\n   - Print the schedule: departure from GGP, arrival at CT, and departure from CT.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - The solution provides a valid schedule meeting all constraints, ensuring at least 105 minutes with David during his availability window."
