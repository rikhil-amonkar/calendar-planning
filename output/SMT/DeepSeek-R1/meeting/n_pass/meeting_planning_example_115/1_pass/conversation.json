        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while adhering to travel times and meeting constraints. The approach involves using the Z3 solver to check feasible schedules that meet the constraints for both friends, and if that's not possible, then checking schedules for meeting each friend individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to meet as many friends as possible given their availability windows and travel times between districts. The constraints include:\n   - Starting at Richmond District at 9:00 AM.\n   - Meeting Carol at Marina District between 11:30 AM and 3:00 PM for at least 60 minutes.\n   - Meeting Jessica at Pacific Heights between 3:30 PM and 4:45 PM for at least 45 minutes.\n   - Travel times between districts are provided.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal schedule should first attempt to meet both friends. If that's not feasible, then meeting either Carol or Jessica individually is the next best option. The sequence of meetings is constrained by travel times and overlapping availability windows.\n\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The Z3 solver is used to model the problem with integer variables representing meeting start times and durations. Constraints are added to ensure:\n   - Travel times are accounted for.\n   - Meetings occur within the friends' availability windows.\n   - Minimum meeting durations are satisfied.\n   - The schedule starts from Richmond District at 9:00 AM.\n\n4. **Solution Strategy**: The solver checks three scenarios in order of priority:\n   - **Both Friends**: Schedule meetings with both Carol and Jessica.\n   - **Carol Only**: Schedule a meeting only with Carol.\n   - **Jessica Only**: Schedule a meeting only with Jessica.\n   The first feasible scenario found is the solution.\n\n5. **Output**: The solution details the departure and arrival times, meeting times, and travel times in a human-readable format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{mins:02d}\"\n\ndef main():\n    #

For each scenario, the Z3 solver checks feasibility by modeling meeting start times, durations, and travel constraints.\n3. **Constraints Handling**: The solver ensures:\n   - Meetings start within the friends' availability windows.\n   - Minimum meeting durations are satisfied.\n   - Travel times between districts are accounted for in the schedule.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: The first feasible scenario found (prioritizing meeting both friends) is selected. The solution details the schedule, including departure, arrival, meeting times, and any waiting periods.\n5. **Output**: The schedule is printed in a human-readable time format, showing the sequence of activities and travel.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible meeting scenarios using constraint solving, ensuring the optimal schedule is found that maximizes the number of friends met within the given constraints."
