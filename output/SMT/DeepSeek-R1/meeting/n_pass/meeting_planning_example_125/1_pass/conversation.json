        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while adhering to their availability constraints and travel times between locations. The goal is to meet both friends if possible; otherwise, meet one. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to check feasibility for different meeting orders and durations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Start at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM.\n   - Stephanie is available at Financial District from 8:15 AM to 11:30 AM, requiring at least 90 minutes together.\n   - John is available at Alamo Square from 10:15 AM to 8:45 PM, requiring at least 30 minutes together.\n   - Travel times between locations are asymmetric and given in minutes.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Meeting both friends is optimal. Two meeting orders are possible:\n     - **Order 1**: Embarcadero \u2192 Financial District (Stephanie) \u2192 Alamo Square (John)\n     - **Order 2**: Embarcadero \u2192 Alamo Square (John) \u2192 Financial District (Stephanie)\n   - If meeting both is infeasible, meet one friend (Stephanie or John).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Use Z3 solver to model constraints for each meeting order.\n   - Check feasibility in the following order:\n     1. Order 1 (Stephanie then John)\n     2. Order 2 (John then Stephanie)\n     3. Only Stephanie\n     4. Only John\n   - Convert solution times from minutes to readable time format.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The Z3 solver efficiently checks constraint satisfaction, making it suitable for small scheduling problems.\n   - The approach systematically checks feasible schedules in decreasing order of preference (both friends, then one friend).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef min_to_time(m):\n    hour = 9 + m // 60\n    minutes = m % 60\n    am_pm = \"AM\" if hour < 12 else \"PM\"\n    display_hour = hour % 12\n    if display_hour == 0:\n        display_hour = 12\n    return f\"{display_hour}:{minutes:02d}{am_pm}\"\n\n# Try meeting both friends in order: Embarcadero -> Financial District -> Alamo Square\ns1, d1, s2, d2 = Ints('s1 d1 s2 d2')\nsolver1 = Solver()\nsolver1.add(s1 >= 5, d1 >= 90, s1 + d1 <= 150)\nsolver1.add(s2 >= s1 + d1 + 17, s2 >= 75, d2 >= 30, s2 + d2 <= 705)\n\nif solver1.check() == sat:\n    model = solver1.model()\n    s1_val = model[s1].as_long()\n    d1_val = model[d1].as_long()\n    s2_val = model[s2].as_long()\n    d2_val = model[d2].as_long()\n    schedule = \"Met both friends: Stephanie and John.\\n\"\n    schedule += f\"  Start at Embarcadero at 9:00AM.\\n\"\n    schedule += f\"  Travel to Financial District (5 minutes), arriving at {min_to_time(s1_val)}.\\n\"\n    schedule += f\"  Meet Stephanie from {min_to_time(s1_val)} to {min_to_time(s1_val + d1_val)} ({d1_val} minutes).\\n\"\n    schedule += f\"  Travel to Alamo Square (17 minutes), arriving at {min_to_time(s1_val + d1_val + 17)}.\\n\"\n    schedule += f\"  Meet John from {min_to_time(s2_val)} to {min_to_time(s2_val + d2_val)} ({d2_val} minutes).\\n\"\n    print(\"SOLUTION: \" + schedule)\nelse:\n    # Try meeting both in reverse order: Embarcadero -> Alamo Square -> Financial District\n    s1_o2, d1_o2, s2_o2, d2_o2 = Ints('s1_o2 d1_o2 s2_o2 d2_o2')\n    solver2 = Solver()\n    solver2.add(s2_o2 >= 19, s2_o2 >= 75, d2_o2 >= 30, s2_o2 + d2_o2 <= 705)\n    solver2.add(s1_o2 >= s2_o2 + d2_o2 + 17, d1_o2 >= 90, s1_o2 + d1_o2 <= 150)\n    \n    if solver2.check() == sat:\n        model = solver2.model()\n        s1_val = model[s1_o2].as_long()\n        d1_val = model[d1_o2].as_long()\n        s2_val = model[s2_o2].as_long()\n        d2_val = model[d2_o2].as_long()\n        schedule = \"Met both friends: Stephanie and John.\\n\"\n        schedule += f\"  Start at Embarcadero at 9:00AM.\\n\"\n        schedule += f\"  Travel to Alamo Square (19 minutes), arriving at {min_to_time(19)}.\\n\"\n        schedule += f\"  Meet John from {min_to_time(s2_val)} to {min_to_time(s2_val + d2_val)} ({d2_val} minutes).\\n\"\n        schedule += f\"  Travel to Financial District (17 minutes), arriving at {min_to_time(s2_val + d2_val + 17)}.\\n\"\n        schedule += f\"  Meet Stephanie from {min_to_time(s1_val)} to {min_to_time(s1_val + d1_val)} ({d1_val} minutes).\\n\"\n        print(\"SOLUTION: \" + schedule)\n    else:\n        # Try meeting only Stephanie\n        s1_o3, d1_o3 = Ints('s1_o3 d1_o3')\n        solver3 = Solver()\n        solver3.add(s1_o3 >= 5, d1_o3 >= 90, s1_o3 + d1_o3 <= 150)\n        if solver3.check() == sat:\n            model = solver3.model()\n            s1_val = model[s1_o3].as_long()\n            d1_val = model[d1_o3].as_long()\n            schedule = \"Met only Stephanie.\\n\"\n            schedule += f\"  Start at Embarcadero at 9:00AM.\\n\"\n            schedule += f\"  Travel to Financial District (5 minutes), arriving at {min_to_time(s1_val)}.\\n\"\n            schedule += f\"  Meet Stephanie from {min_to_time(s1_val)} to {min_to_time(s1_val + d1_val)} ({d1_val} minutes).\\n\"\n            print(\"SOLUTION: \" + schedule)\n        else:\n            # Try meeting only John\n            s2_o4, d2_o4 = Ints('s2_o4 d2_o4')\n            solver4 = Solver()\n            solver4.add(s2_o4 >= 19, s2_o4 >= 75, d2_o4 >= 30, s2_o4 + d2_o4 <= 705)\n            if solver4.check() == sat:\n                model = solver4.model()\n                s2_val = model[s2_o4].as_long()\n                d2_val = model[d2_o4].as_long()\n                schedule = \"Met only John.\\n\"\n                schedule += f\"  Start at Embarcadero at 9:00AM.\\n\"\n                schedule += f\"  Travel to Alamo Square (19 minutes), arriving at {min_to_time(19)}.\\n\"\n                schedule += f\"  Meet John from {min_to_time(s2_val)} to {min_to_time(s2_val + d2_val)} ({d2_val} minutes).\\n\"\n                print(\"SOLUTION: \" + schedule)\n            else:\n                print(\"SOLUTION: Could not meet any friend.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `min_to_time` function converts minutes from 9:00 AM into a readable time format (e.g., 90 minutes becomes 10:30 AM).\n2. **Order 1 Check**: The solver checks if meeting Stephanie first and then John is feasible by:\n   - Ensuring Stephanie's meeting starts after arrival (9:05 AM) and lasts at least 90 minutes within her availability (until 11:30 AM).\n   - Ensuring John's meeting starts after traveling from Stephanie's location and lasts at least 30 minutes within his availability (until 8:45 PM).\n3. **Order 2 Check**: If Order 1 is infeasible, the solver checks the reverse order (John then Stephanie) with similar constraints.\n4. **Single Friend Check**: If meeting both is infeasible, the solver checks meeting only Stephanie or only John, ensuring their respective constraints are met.\n5. **Output**: The solution prints the optimal schedule meeting the maximum number of friends, detailing travel and meeting times. The first feasible schedule found is printed, prioritizing meeting both friends."
