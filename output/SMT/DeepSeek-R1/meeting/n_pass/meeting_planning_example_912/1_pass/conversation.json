        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while respecting their availability windows and accounting for travel times between locations. The approach involves using constraint programming with the Z3 solver to model the problem as an optimization task where the goal is to maximize the count of friends met.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We start at Union Square at 9:00 AM.\n   - Each friend has a specific time window during which they are available, and we need to meet them for at least a minimum duration within this window.\n   - Travel times between locations are provided, and we must account for these when moving between meetings.\n   - The objective is to maximize the number of friends met.\n\n2. **Modeling**:\n   - **Variables**: \n     - Boolean variables for each friend indicating whether they are met.\n     - Integer variables for the start and end times of each meeting (in minutes since 9:00 AM).\n     - Boolean variables to represent the order of meetings (whether one meeting occurs before another).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Time Windows**: For each friend, if met, their start time must be within their availability window, and the meeting must last at least the minimum duration.\n     - **Travel Constraints**: For any two consecutive meetings (including the start from Union Square), the start time of the next meeting must be at least the end time of the previous meeting plus the travel time between their locations.\n     - **Ordering Constraints**: Ensure a consistent ordering of meetings to handle travel times correctly.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the sum of Boolean variables representing whether each friend is met.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - The Z3 solver is used for its ability to handle integer constraints and Boolean logic efficiently. The problem is modeled as a maximization problem with the constraints described.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - The problem involves 10 friends, leading to 10 Boolean variables for meetings, 10 integer variables for start times, and 10 for end times. The ordering requires 110 Boolean variables (for each pair of distinct events) and transitivity constraints, making the total constraints manageable for Z3.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3

Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `time_str_to_minutes_since_9am` function converts time strings (e.g., \"3:30PM\") to minutes since 9:00 AM.\n2. **Travel Data Parsing**: The provided travel times are parsed into a dictionary for quick lookup between locations.\n3. **Friend Data**: Each friend's details (name, location, availability window, and minimum meeting duration) are stored in a list.\n4. **Z3 Setup**: The solver is initialized with Boolean variables for meeting each friend, integer variables for meeting start and end times, and Boolean variables to represent the order of meetings.\n5. **Constraints**:\n   - **Ordering Constraints**: Ensure the dummy start (Union Square) is the first event, and meetings are ordered consistently.\n   - **Time Window Constraints**: Ensure meetings occur within the friend's availability window and last at least the minimum duration.\n   - **Travel Constraints**: Account for travel times between consecutive meetings.\n6. **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n7. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the meetings are formatted into a sorted itinerary with start and end times converted to 24-hour format.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling problem using constraint programming to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all given constraints."
