        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while respecting their availability windows and travel times between locations. The approach involves using the Z3 solver to model the problem with constraints on meeting times, travel durations, and the sequence of visits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM and need to meet friends at various locations in San Francisco. Each friend has a specific availability window and a minimum required meeting duration. Travel times between locations are provided.\n2. **Key Constraints**: \n   - **Meeting Constraints**: Each meeting must start within the friend's availability window and last at least the minimum required duration.\n   - **Travel Constraints**: The start time of the next meeting must account for the travel time from the previous location.\n   - **Sequence Constraints**: The sequence of visits must be contiguous, starting from the first meeting after leaving Golden Gate Park.\n3. **Z3 Modeling**: \n   - **Variables**: \n     - Boolean variables `meet_i` indicate if friend `i` is met.\n     - Real variables `start_i` represent the start time of each meeting.\n     - Integer variables `seq_k` denote the friend at position `k` in the sequence (or -1 if the slot is unused).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - Each `seq_k` is either -1 or a valid friend index (0-4).\n     - Non-negative entries in `seq` must be distinct.\n     - The sequence must be contiguous (no gaps between scheduled meetings).\n     - If a friend is met, they must appear exactly once in the sequence.\n     - The first meeting must start after leaving Golden Gate Park plus travel time.\n     - Consecutive meetings must account for travel time between locations.\n     - Each meeting must fit within the friend's availability window.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met (sum of `meet_i`).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Travel time matrix: [Golden Gate Park, Haight-Ashbury, Sunset District, Marina District, Financial District, Union Square]\n    T = [\n        [0, 7, 10, 16, 26, 22],\n        [7, 0, 15, 17, 21, 17],\n        [11, 15, 0, 21, 30, 30],\n        [18, 16, 19, 0, 17, 16],\n        [23, 19, 31, 15, 0, 9],\n        [22, 18, 26, 18, 9, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Friend data: [Matthew, Robert, Joseph, Patricia, Sarah]\n    # Each friend: [location_index, min_duration, available_start, available_end]\n    friends_data = [\n        (3, 15, 555, 720),    # Matthew: Marina, 9:15AM to 12:00PM\n        (5, 15, 615, 1305),    # Robert: Union Square, 10:15AM to 9:45PM\n        (4, 30, 855, 1125),    # Joseph: Financial, 2:15PM to 6:45PM\n        (2, 45, 1020, 1185),   # Patricia: Sunset, 5:00PM to 7:45PM\n        (1, 105, 1020, 1290)   # Sarah: Haight, 5:00PM to 9:30PM\n    ]\n    loc = [data[0] for data in friends_data]\n    duration = [data[1] for data in friends_data]\n    available_start = [data[2] for data in friends_data]\n    available_end = [data[3] for data in friends_data]\n    friend_names = [\"Matthew\", \"Robert\", \"Joseph\", \"Patricia\", \"Sarah\"]\n    \n    # Create solver and variables\n    opt = Optimize()\n    n_friends = 5\n    meet = [Bool(f\"meet_{i}\") for i in range(n_friends)]\n    start = [Real(f\"start_{i}\") for i in range(n_friends)]\n    seq = [Int(f\"seq_{k}\") for k in range(n_friends)]\n    \n    # Constraints for sequence variables: each seq[k] is in [-1, 4]\n    for k in range(n_friends):\n        opt.add(Or(seq[k] == -1, And(seq[k] >= 0, seq[k] < n_friends)))\n    \n    # Non-negative entries in seq must be distinct\n    for k1 in range(n_friends):\n        for k2 in range(k1 + 1, n_friends):\n            opt.add(Implies(And(seq[k1] != -1, seq[k2] != -1), seq[k1] != seq[k2]))\n    \n    # Sequence must be contiguous: if seq[k] is -1, then all subsequent must be -1\n    for k in range(n_friends -
