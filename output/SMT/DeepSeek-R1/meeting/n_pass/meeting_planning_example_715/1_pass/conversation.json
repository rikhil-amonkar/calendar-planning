        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met in San Francisco while respecting their availability windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times between locations. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to find an optimal schedule that meets these constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling meetings with friends at different locations in San Francisco. Each friend has a specific time window during which they are available, and we must meet them for at least a minimum duration. Travel times between locations are provided, and we start at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n\n2. **Key Constraints**:\n   - **Travel Times**: The time taken to move between locations affects the schedule.\n   - **Availability Windows**: Each friend is available only during specific times.\n   - **Minimum Meeting Durations**: Each meeting must last at least the specified minimum duration.\n   - **Order of Meetings**: The sequence of meetings must account for travel times between consecutive locations.\n\n3. **Solution Strategy**:\n   - **Z3 Solver**: We use the Z3 theorem prover to model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n   - **Iterative Scheduling**: We attempt to schedule meetings for all 8 friends first. If that's infeasible, we try scheduling 7 friends, and so on, until a feasible schedule is found.\n   - **Time Conversion**: Convert all times to minutes past midnight for easier arithmetic operations.\n   - **Travel Time Matrix**: Precompute travel times between all pairs of locations to facilitate quick access during scheduling.\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - **Initialization**: Define friends' details (availability, location, duration) and travel times.\n   - **Precomputation**: Compute travel times from the starting location (Presidio) to each friend's location and between every pair of friends' locations.\n   - **Z3 Modeling**:\n     - For each possible number of meetings (from 8 down to 1), create Z3 variables for the start and end times of each meeting and the sequence of friends.\n     - Ensure distinct friends in the sequence.\n     - Add constraints for travel times, availability windows, and meeting durations.\n   - **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible schedule is found, convert the start and end times back to HH:MM format and return the itinerary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    #

Each friend's details (name, location, availability window, and minimum meeting duration) are stored in a list.\n2. **Precomputation**: The travel times from the starting location (Presidio) to each friend's location and between every pair of friends' locations are precomputed for quick access.\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**: For each possible number of meetings (from 8 down to 1), the solver initializes variables for start times, end times, and the sequence of friends. Constraints ensure that:\n   - Each friend is met at most once.\n   - Meetings occur within the friend's availability window.\n   - Minimum meeting durations are respected.\n   - Travel times between consecutive meetings are accounted for.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible schedule is found, the start and end times are converted to HH:MM format, and the itinerary is printed in JSON format. If no feasible schedule is found, an empty itinerary is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores possible schedules by leveraging the Z3 solver to handle the complex constraints, ensuring the maximum number of friends are met within the given constraints."
