        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends we can meet in a day while respecting their availability windows and travel times between locations. The approach involves using constraint programming with the Z3 solver to model the problem and find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We start at The Castro at 9:00 AM (time 0).\n   - Each friend has a specific location, availability window, and minimum meeting duration.\n   - Travel times between all pairs of locations are provided.\n   - The goal is to maximize the number of friends met, ensuring each meeting:\n     - Starts within the friend's availability window.\n     - Lasts at least the minimum duration.\n     - Accounts for travel time from the previous location (or starting point).\n\n2. **Modeling**:\n   - **Variables**: For each friend (excluding Ronald, as we cannot meet him within his window), we define:\n     - A boolean variable indicating if we meet the friend.\n     - Integer variables for the start and end times of the meeting.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - If a friend is met, their meeting must start within their availability window and end before the window closes.\n     - The start time must allow for travel from the previous location (or starting point).\n     - For any two meetings, either one must start after the other ends plus travel time (disjunctive constraint to prevent overlaps).\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the sum of boolean variables (number of friends met).\n\n3. **Optimization**:\n   - Use Z3's optimizer to maximize the number of meetings.\n   - Convert the solution to human-readable times for output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    #
