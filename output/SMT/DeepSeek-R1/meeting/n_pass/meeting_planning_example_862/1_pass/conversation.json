        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends we can meet in San Francisco given their availability windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times between locations. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to model the constraints and find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We start at Mission District at 9:00 AM.\n   - Each friend has a specific time window during which they are available and a minimum meeting duration.\n   - Travel times between different locations are provided.\n   - The goal is to maximize the number of friends met while respecting their availability, meeting durations, and travel times.\n\n2. **Modeling**:\n   - **Variables**: \n     - `met[i]`: Boolean variable indicating if friend `i` is met.\n     - `start[i]`: Integer variable representing the start time (in minutes from 9:00 AM) of the meeting with friend `i`.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - If a friend is met (`met[i]` is true), their meeting must start within their availability window and last at least the minimum duration.\n     - The start time for any meeting must account for travel time from Mission District.\n     - For any two friends met, their meetings must not overlap, and the start time of the later meeting must include the travel time from the earlier meeting's location.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the sum of `met[i]` variables to meet as many friends as possible.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Use Z3's `Optimize` solver to maximize the number of friends met.\n   - Define constraints to ensure meetings fit within availability windows and include travel times.\n   - Use pairwise constraints to ensure no overlapping meetings and sufficient travel time between consecutive meetings.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The problem involves 9 friends, leading to 9 Boolean and 9 integer variables.\n   - There are 9 constraints for individual meetings and 36 pairwise constraints, which is manageable for Z3.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    #
