        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met in a day while respecting their availability windows and travel times between locations. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to model the constraints and find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at The Castro at 9:00 AM (540 minutes from midnight). Each friend has a specific availability window and a minimum meeting duration. Travel times between locations are asymmetric and provided in a matrix.\n2. **Modeling with Z3**: \n   - **Variables**: For each friend, we use a boolean variable to indicate if they are met, and real variables for the start and end times of their meetings.\n   - **Dummy Meeting**: A dummy meeting at The Castro at 9:00 AM with zero duration is used to simplify travel time constraints from the starting point.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Meeting Constraints**: If a friend is met, their meeting must start within their availability window and last at least the minimum duration.\n     - **Travel Constraints**: For any two meetings (including the dummy), if both are met, the start time of one must be after the end time of the other plus the travel time between their locations.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n3. **Solving**: The Z3 solver checks all possible schedules to find the one that meets the most friends while respecting all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\n# Define the travel time matrix (11x11) for locations 0 to 10\nT = [\n    [0, 20, 11, 22, 6, 16, 16, 21, 20, 19, 21],\n    [23, 0, 22, 6, 18, 18, 7, 9, 17, 7, 8],\n    [13, 23, 0, 25, 7, 7, 20, 16, 11, 22, 26],\n    [25, 5, 25, 0, 21, 21, 10, 12, 20, 10, 5],\n    [6, 19, 7, 20, 0, 10, 15, 17, 15, 19, 21],\n    [16, 17, 9, 19, 10, 0, 17, 9, 7, 21, 22],\n    [17, 8, 17, 9, 13, 14, 0, 11, 17, 7, 9],\n    [22, 11, 18, 14, 16, 11, 12, 0, 10, 16, 17],\n    [21, 18, 12, 20, 15, 7, 18, 11, 0, 22, 23],\n    [17, 10, 22, 11, 18, 20, 9, 18, 24, 0, 9],\n    [20, 7, 23, 4, 19, 21, 8, 15, 22, 9, 0]\n]\n\n# Meeting data: min_duration, avail_start, avail_end for meetings 0 to 10\n# Index 0 is dummy (handled separately)\nmin_dur = [0, 15, 75, 105, 75, 30, 90, 120, 120, 60, 45]\navail_start = [0, 1050, 1020, 855, 615, 840, 495, 675, 900, 690, 795]\navail_end = [0, 1230, 1155, 960, 735, 1170, 765, 795, 1095, 1260, 915]\n\n# Names of friends for each meeting index\nnames = [\n    \"Dummy (The Castro)\",\n    \"Steven (North Beach)\",\n    \"Sarah (Golden Gate Park)\",\n    \"Brian (Embarcadero)\",\n    \"Stephanie (Haight-Ashbury)\",\n    \"Melissa (Richmond District)\",\n    \"Nancy (Nob Hill)\",\n    \"David (Marina District)\",\n    \"James (Presidio)\",\n    \"Elizabeth (Union Square)\",\n    \"Robert (Financial District)\"\n]\n\n# Create Z3 variables and solver\ns = Optimize()\nnum_meetings = 11\n\n# met[i] is True if we meet friend i\nmet = [Bool(f'met_{i}') for i in range(num_meetings)]\n# start[i] and end[i] are the start and end times of meeting i\nstart = [Real(f'start_{i}') for i in range(num_meetings)]\nend = [Real(f'end_{i}') for i in range(num_meetings)]\n\n# Dummy meeting (index 0) is fixed at 9:00 AM (540 minutes)\ns.add(met[0] == True)\ns.add(start[0] == 540)\ns.add(end[0] == 540)\n\n# Constraints for meetings 1 to 10\nfor i in range(1, num_meetings):\n    #
