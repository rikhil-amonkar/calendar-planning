        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while adhering to their availability constraints and travel times between locations. The goal is to find an optimal schedule that allows meeting as many friends as possible, considering their specific time windows and minimum meeting durations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling meetings with friends at different locations (Alamo Square, Russian Hill, Presidio) starting from Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. Each friend has a specific availability window and a minimum meeting duration requirement. Travel times between locations are provided.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal schedule must respect travel times and availability windows. The sequence of meetings is constrained by the friends' availability: Timothy (12:00 PM to 4:15 PM), Joseph (4:45 PM to 9:30 PM), and Mark (6:45 PM to 9:00 PM). The feasible sequence for meeting all three is Timothy -> Joseph -> Mark.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use the Z3 solver to model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. Variables represent start and end times of each meeting, and constraints ensure:\n   - Start times are within the friend's availability window.\n   - Minimum meeting durations are met.\n   - Travel times between locations are accounted for.\n   - The schedule starts at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM.\n4. **Optimization**: The solver checks sequences in descending order of the number of meetings (3, 2, 1) to maximize the number of friends met. For each sequence, it verifies feasibility by satisfying all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    mins = minutes % 60\n    am_pm = \"AM\" if hours < 12 else \"PM\"\n    hours12 = hours % 12\n    if hours12 == 0:\n        hours12 = 12\n    return f\"{hours12}:{mins:02d}{am_pm}\"\n\ndef main():\n    travel_time = {\n        0: {1: 10, 2: 19, 3: 11},\n        1: {2: 13, 3: 18},\n        2: {3: 14},\n        3: {}\n    }\n    \n    meeting_info = {\n        1: {'loc': 'Alamo Square', 'start_avail': 720, 'end_avail': 975, 'min_dur': 105, 'friend': 'Timothy'},\n        2: {'loc': 'Russian Hill', 'start_avail': 1005, 'end_avail': 1170, 'min_dur': 60, 'friend': 'Joseph'},\n        3: {'loc': 'Presidio', 'start_avail': 1185, 'end_avail': 1260, 'min_dur': 60, 'friend': 'Mark'}\n    }\n    \n    combinations = [\n        (1, 2, 3, [0, 1, 2, 3]),\n        (1, 2, [0, 1, 2]),\n        (1, 3, [0, 1, 3]),\n        (2, 3, [0, 2, 3]),\n        (1, [0, 1]),\n        (2, [0, 2]),\n        (3, [0, 3])\n    ]\n    \n    for comb in combinations:\n        meetings = comb[:-1]\n        sequence = comb[-1]\n        s = Solver()\n        \n        t = Int('t')\n        s.add(t >= 540)\n        \n        A = {}\n        S = {}\n        E = {}\n        prev_loc = sequence[0]\n        for idx, loc in enumerate(sequence[1:], start=1):\n            meeting_id = meetings[idx-1] if len(meetings) < 3 else loc\n            info = meeting_info[meeting_id]\n            \n            if idx == 1:\n                A_i = t + travel_time[prev_loc][loc]\n            else:\n                prev_meeting_id = meetings[idx-2] if len(meetings) < 3 else sequence[idx-1]\n                A_i = E[prev_meeting_id] + travel_time[prev_loc][loc]\n            A[meeting_id] = A_i\n            \n            s.add(A_i <= info['end_avail'] - info['min_dur'])\n            \n            S_i = If(A_i >= info['start_avail'], A_i, info['start_avail'])\n            S[meeting_id] = S_i\n            E_i = S_i + info['min_dur']\n            E[meeting_id] = E_i\n            \n            prev_loc = loc\n        \n        if s.check() == sat:\n            m = s.model()\n            schedule = []\n            for meet_id in meetings:\n                start_val = m.eval(S[meet_id]).as_long()\n                end_val = m.eval(E[meet_id]).as_long()\n                schedule.append((meet_id, start_val, end_val))\n            \n            print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n            for meet_id, start, end in schedule:\n                friend = meeting_info[meet_id]['friend']\n                location = meeting_info[meet_id]['loc']\n                start_str = minutes_to_time(start)\n                end_str = minutes_to_time(end)\n                print(f\"Meet {friend} at {location} from {start_str} to {end_str}.\")\n            return\n    \n    print(\"SOLUTION: No feasible schedule found.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The `travel_time` dictionary stores travel times between locations, and `meeting_info` contains each friend's availability and meeting constraints.\n2. **Combination Handling**: The code checks sequences of meetings in descending order of the number of friends (3, 2, 1). For each sequence, it initializes a Z3 solver.\n3. **Constraints Setup**: \n   - **Start Time**: The departure time from Golden Gate Park (`t`) must be at or after 9:00 AM (540 minutes).\n   - **Arrival Time**: For each meeting, the arrival time at the location is computed considering travel from the previous location.\n   - **Meeting Constraints**: The arrival time must allow the minimum meeting duration within the friend's availability window. The start time is the maximum of the arrival time and the friend's availability start time.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible schedule is found, the start and end times for each meeting are converted to a readable format and printed. The solution stops at the first feasible schedule with the maximum number of friends.\n5. **Output**: The schedule details the friend, location, and meeting times. If no feasible schedule is found, it outputs a corresponding message.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all given constraints."
