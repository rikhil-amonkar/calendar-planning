        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we aim to maximize the number of friends met while respecting travel times and availability constraints. The approach involves using the Z3 solver to model the problem with constraints on meeting times, durations, and travel between locations. The solution will determine the optimal schedule by maximizing the number of friends met.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We start at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM.\n   - Each friend has specific availability windows and minimum meeting durations:\n     - Betty: Presidio (10:15 AM to 9:30 PM, 45 minutes)\n     - David: Richmond District (1:00 PM to 8:15 PM, 90 minutes)\n     - Barbara: Fisherman's Wharf (9:15 AM to 8:15 PM, 120 minutes)\n   - Travel times between locations are provided in minutes.\n\n2. **Modeling with Z3**:\n   - **Boolean Variables**: Represent whether each friend is met (`meet_Betty`, `meet_David`, `meet_Barbara`).\n   - **Integer Variables**: Represent the start times of meetings in minutes past 9:00 AM (`S_Betty`, `S_David`, `S_Barbara`).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Meeting Windows**: Each meeting must start within the friend's availability window and last at least the minimum duration.\n     - **Travel from Start**: The start time of each meeting must account for travel time from Embarcadero.\n     - **Order of Meetings**: For any two friends met, their meetings must not overlap and must account for travel time between locations.\n\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of Boolean variables to meet as many friends as possible.\n\n4. **Solution Extraction**: \n   - Check if a solution exists.\n   - Convert start times from minutes to readable time format.\n   - Output the schedule for each friend met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    #
