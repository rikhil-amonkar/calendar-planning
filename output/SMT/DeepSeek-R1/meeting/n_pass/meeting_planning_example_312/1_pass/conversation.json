        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends we can meet in San Francisco while adhering to their availability constraints and travel times between districts. The solution involves evaluating all possible subsets of friends and their permutations to find a feasible schedule that allows meeting as many friends as possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at the Richmond District at 9:00 AM. Each friend has specific availability windows and minimum meeting durations. Travel times between districts are provided.\n2. **Key Insight**: The goal is to maximize the number of friends met. We prioritize larger subsets first (from 4 down to 0) to ensure we meet as many friends as possible.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each subset size (4, 3, 2, 1, 0), generate all combinations of friends. For each combination, generate all permutations to explore different meeting orders.\n4. **Constraints Handling**: For each permutation, use the Z3 solver to check feasibility:\n   - **Travel Time**: Ensure travel time from the previous location to the next is accounted for.\n   - **Availability**: Meetings must start within the friend's availability window and last for at least the minimum duration.\n   - **Time Management**: The start time of each meeting must be after the end of the previous meeting plus travel time.\n5. **Output**: The first feasible schedule found (with the most friends) is printed, detailing the meeting times for each friend.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport z3\n\ndef main():\n    #

If no feasible schedule is found, it outputs that no friends can be met. \n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible schedules, leveraging constraint solving to ensure optimality and feasibility."
