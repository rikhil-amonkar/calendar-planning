        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while respecting their availability constraints and the travel times between different locations in San Francisco. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to model the constraints and optimize the schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at Bayview at 9:00 AM. Each friend is available at a specific location during a certain time window, and we must meet them for a minimum duration. Travel times between locations are asymmetric, meaning the time from location A to B may differ from B to A.\n2. **Modeling the Problem**: \n   - **Variables**: For each friend, we define a boolean variable indicating whether we meet them and an integer variable representing the start time of the meeting.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - If a friend is met, their meeting must start within their availability window and last for the minimum duration.\n     - The start time must account for travel time from Bayview to the friend's location.\n     - For any two friends met, their meetings must not overlap, and travel time between their locations must be considered if they are consecutive in the schedule.\n3. **Optimization Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: After solving the model, we decode the start times into human-readable formats and print the schedule.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    #

These times are used to build a distance matrix for quick access during constraint checking.\n2. **Friend Data**: Each friend's details (name, location, availability window, and minimum meeting duration) are stored in a list of dictionaries.\n3. **Z3 Variables**: For each friend, we create:\n   - A boolean variable (`meet`) to indicate if the friend is met.\n   - An integer variable (`start`) to represent the meeting start time in minutes from 9:00 AM.\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Constraints**: If a friend is met, their meeting must fit within their availability window, and the start time must account for travel from Bayview.\n   - **Pairwise Constraints**: For any two friends met, their meetings must be scheduled such that travel time between their locations is respected, ensuring no overlaps.\n5. **Optimization**: The objective is to maximize the number of friends met. The Z3 optimizer checks for a feasible schedule that meets this goal.\n6. **Output**: The solution decodes the start times into readable formats and prints the schedule, including which friends are met, their locations, and meeting times.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling problem using constraint programming and leverages Z3's optimization capabilities to find the best possible schedule."
