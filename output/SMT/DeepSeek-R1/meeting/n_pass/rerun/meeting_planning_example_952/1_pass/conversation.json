        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends we can meet in a day, considering their availability windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times between different locations in San Francisco. The solution involves using constraint programming to model the problem and the Z3 solver to find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires scheduling meetings with friends at specific locations within their available time windows while accounting for travel times between locations. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping schedules and ensuring travel times are respected.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Time Conversion**: Convert all time windows and travel durations into minutes from a common start time (9:00 AM).\n   - **Travel Time Matrix**: Use a precomputed dictionary to store travel times between all pairs of locations.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - Each meeting must start within the friend's availability window and last at least the minimum duration.\n     - For any two consecutive meetings, the start time of the next meeting must be after the end time of the previous meeting plus the travel time between their locations.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the number of friends met.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Z3 Solver**: Utilize Z3's integer and boolean variables to model meeting decisions, start times, and end times.\n   - **Constraints Handling**: Implement constraints for meeting windows, durations, and pairwise travel times between meetings.\n   - **Objective Function**: Maximize the sum of boolean variables representing whether a friend is met.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The problem involves 10 friends, leading to 10 boolean variables and 20 integer variables (start and end times). The pairwise constraints result in 110 constraints (11 meetings, including the start location). While the problem is NP-hard, Z3 efficiently handles this scale.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # List of friends: (name, location, window_start (minutes from 9:00AM), window_end, min_duration)\n    friends = [\n        (\"Brian\", \"North Beach\", 240, 600, 90),\n        (\"Richard\", \"Fisherman's Wharf\", 120, 225, 60),\n        (\"Ashley\", \"Haight-Ashbury\", 360, 690, 90),\n        (\"Elizabeth\", \"Nob Hill\", 165, 570, 75),\n        (\"Jessica\", \"Golden Gate Park\", 660, 765, 105),\n        (\"Deborah\", \"Union Square\", 510, 780, 60),\n        (\"Kimberly\", \"Alamo Square\", 510, 735, 45),\n        (\"Matthew\", \"Presidio\", -45, 0, 15),\n        (\"Kenneth\", \"Chinatown\", 285, 630, 105),\n        (\"Anthony\", \"Pacific Heights\", 315, 420, 30)\n    ]\n    \n    #
