        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met while adhering to the given constraints. The constraints include specific time windows for meeting each friend, minimum meeting durations, and travel times between locations. The solution involves determining an optimal schedule that allows meeting both friends by considering travel times and ensuring all constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We start at North Beach (location 0) at 9:00 AM (time 0 minutes).\n   - James is available at Mission District (location 1) from 12:45 PM (225 minutes after 9:00 AM) to 2:00 PM (300 minutes after 9:00 AM). We must meet him for exactly 75 minutes (the entire window).\n   - Robert is available at The Castro (location 2) from 12:45 PM (225 minutes) to 3:15 PM (375 minutes). We must meet him for at least 30 minutes.\n   - Travel times between locations are given as a matrix.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The only feasible schedule is to travel from North Beach to Mission District first (to meet James), then to The Castro (to meet Robert). The reverse order is infeasible because Robert's availability starts at the same time as James's, making it impossible to be at both locations simultaneously without being late for James.\n\n3. **Constraints Handling**:\n   - **James Meeting**: We must arrive at Mission District by 225 minutes and stay until 300 minutes.\n   - **Robert Meeting**: We must arrive at The Castro by 345 minutes (375 - 30) to allow a 30-minute meeting before 375 minutes.\n   - **Travel Times**: \n     - North Beach to Mission District: 18 minutes.\n     - Mission District to The Castro: 7 minutes.\n\n4. **Z3 Solver Setup**:\n   - Define integer variables for the departure times from North Beach (`t0_leave`) and Mission District (`t1_leave`).\n   - Add constraints:\n     - Departure from North Beach must be at least 0 minutes.\n     - Arrival at Mission District (`t0_leave + 18`) must be \u2264 225 minutes.\n     - Departure from Mission District (`t1_leave`) must be \u2265 300 minutes.\n     - Arrival at The Castro (`t1_leave + 7`) plus 30 minutes must be \u2264 375 minutes.\n   - The solver checks for a feasible schedule and outputs the times if found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    t0_leave = Int('t0_leave')\n    t1_leave = Int('t1_leave')\n    \n    s.add(t0_leave >= 0)\n    s.add(t1_leave >= t0_leave + 18)\n    s.add(t0_leave + 18 <= 225)\n    s.add(t1_leave >= 300)\n    s.add(t1_leave + 37 <= 375)\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        leave0 = m[t0_leave].as_long()\n        leave1 = m[t1_leave].as_long()\n        print(\"Schedule in minutes after 9:00 AM:\")\n        print(f\"  - Stay at North Beach until: {leave0} minutes\")\n        print(f\"  - Travel to Mission District (18 min), arrive at: {leave0 + 18} minutes\")\n        print(f\"  - Meet James from 225 to 300 minutes (exactly 75 minutes)\")\n        print(f\"  - Leave Mission District at: {leave1} minutes\")\n        print(f\"  - Travel to The Castro (7 min), arrive at: {leave1 + 7} minutes\")\n        print(f\"  - Meet Robert from {leave1 + 7} to {leave1 + 37} minutes (30 minutes duration)\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No valid schedule found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to find feasible departure times.\n2. **Variables**:\n   - `t0_leave`: Time to leave North Beach.\n   - `t1_leave`: Time to leave Mission District.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - Departure from North Beach must be non-negative.\n   - Arrival at Mission District must be by 225 minutes (ensuring we meet James on time).\n   - Departure from Mission District must be at or after 300 minutes (meeting James for the full duration).\n   - Arrival at The Castro plus 30 minutes must not exceed 375 minutes (ensuring we meet Robert within his availability).\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the schedule is printed, detailing each segment of the journey and meetings. If no solution is found, an appropriate message is displayed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to ensure all travel and meeting constraints are met, providing an optimal schedule to meet both friends."
