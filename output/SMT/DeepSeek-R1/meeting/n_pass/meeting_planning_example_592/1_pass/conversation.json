        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends met in San Francisco while adhering to their availability windows and travel times between locations. The solution involves modeling the problem using constraints and leveraging the Z3 solver to find an optimal schedule.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at North Beach at 9:00 AM. Each friend has a specific location, availability window, and minimum meeting duration. Travel times between locations are provided. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible without violating any constraints.\n\n2. **Time Conversion**: Convert all times to minutes from 9:00 AM for easier calculations. For example, 9:30 AM becomes 30 minutes, and 8:00 PM becomes 660 minutes.\n\n3. **Travel Time Dictionary**: Create a dictionary to store travel times between all pairs of locations for quick access during constraint checking.\n\n4. **Z3 Variables and Constraints**:\n   - **Boolean Variables**: For each friend, a boolean variable indicates whether they are met.\n   - **Real Variables**: For each friend, real variables represent the start and end times of their meeting.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Time Window Constraints**: If a friend is met, their meeting must start within their availability window, and the meeting duration must meet the minimum requirement.\n     - **Travel Time Constraints**: The start time of the first meeting must account for travel from North Beach. For subsequent meetings, the start time must include travel time from the previous meeting location.\n     - **Disjunctive Constraints**: For any two meetings, ensure they do not overlap by accounting for travel times between their locations.\n\n5. **Objective Function**: Maximize the sum of boolean variables (i.e., the number of friends met).\n\n6. **Solution Extraction**: After solving, check the model for the meetings that can be attended and their respective start and end times.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    #
