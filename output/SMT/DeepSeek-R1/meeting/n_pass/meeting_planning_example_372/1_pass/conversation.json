        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to maximize the number of friends we can meet in a day while respecting their availability windows and the travel times between different locations. The solution involves modeling the problem as a constraint optimization problem using the Z3 solver.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM. Each friend has specific time windows during which they are available, and we need to meet them for at least a minimum duration. Travel times between locations are asymmetric and given.\n2. **Key Insight**: The goal is to schedule meetings in an order that minimizes travel time and fits within the friends' availability windows, ensuring each meeting lasts at least the required minimum duration.\n3. **Modeling with Z3**:\n   - **Variables**: \n     - `do[i]`: Boolean indicating if we meet friend `i`.\n     - `order[j]`: Integer representing the meeting at position `j` in the sequence (or -1 if no meeting).\n     - `start[i]` and `end[i]`: Start and end times (in minutes from 9:00 AM) for meeting `i`.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Active Meetings**: Meetings must be scheduled in consecutive positions without gaps.\n     - **Distinct Meetings**: Each meeting can appear at most once in the sequence.\n     - **Time Windows**: Meetings must start within the friend's availability window and end before the window closes, with duration exactly the minimum required.\n     - **Travel Times**: The start time of the next meeting must account for the travel time from the previous location.\n   - **Objective**: Maximize the number of meetings scheduled.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: After solving, we decode the model to get the sequence of meetings and their start/end times, converting minutes back to readable time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    #

The Z3 solver finds the optimal sequence.\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed, showing the sequence of meetings with their start and end times in a readable format.\n\nThis approach efficiently schedules meetings by leveraging constraint optimization, ensuring all constraints are met while maximizing the number of friends visited."
