        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to determine the optimal times to leave Fisherman's Wharf, arrive at Nob Hill, and leave Nob Hill to meet Kenneth for at least 90 minutes during his availability window (2:15 PM to 7:45 PM). The travel time between locations is 11 minutes each way. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to schedule a visit to Nob Hill such that the meeting with Kenneth lasts at least 90 minutes within his available time frame (2:15 PM to 7:45 PM). We start at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM.\n2. **Key Constraints**: \n   - Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes.\n   - Kenneth is available from 14:15 (2:15 PM) to 19:45 (7:45 PM) in 24-hour format.\n   - The meeting duration must be at least 90 minutes.\n3. **Modeling**:\n   - Convert all times to minutes since 9:00 AM (e.g., 9:00 AM is 0 minutes, 2:15 PM is 315 minutes).\n   - Use integer variables for departure times from Fisherman's Wharf (`t_depart_fw`) and Nob Hill (`t_depart_nh`).\n   - The arrival time at Nob Hill is `t_depart_fw + 11`.\n   - The meeting start time is the later of the arrival time at Nob Hill or 315 minutes (2:15 PM).\n   - The meeting end time is the earlier of the departure time from Nob Hill or 645 minutes (7:45 PM).\n   - The meeting duration is the difference between the meeting end time and start time, which must be at least 90 minutes.\n4. **Solver Setup**: Utilize the Z3 solver to find values for `t_depart_fw` and `t_depart_nh` that satisfy all constraints.\n5. **Output**: Convert the solution times back to HH:MM format and print the schedule.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef minutes_to_time(t):\n    total_minutes = 540 + t  # 540 minutes = 9:00 AM\n    hours = total_minutes // 60\n    minutes = total_minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\ns = Solver()\n\nt_depart_fw = Int('t_depart_fw')\nt_depart_nh = Int('t_depart_nh')\n\nt_arrive_nh = t_depart_fw + 11\n\ns.add(t_depart_fw >= 0)\ns.add(t_depart_nh >= t_arrive_nh)\n\ns_start = If(t_arrive_nh < 315, 315, t_arrive_nh)\ne_end = If(t_depart_nh > 645, 645, t_depart_nh)\n\nmeeting_duration = If(e_end > s_start, e_end - s_start, 0)\ns.add(meeting_duration >= 90)\n\nif s.check() == sat:\n    m = s.model()\n    dep_fw = m[t_depart_fw].as_long()\n    dep_nh = m[t_depart_nh].as_long()\n    arr_nh = dep_fw + 11\n\n    time_dep_fw = minutes_to_time(dep_fw)\n    time_arr_nh = minutes_to_time(arr_nh)\n    time_dep_nh = minutes_to_time(dep_nh)\n\n    s_start_val = max(arr_nh, 315)\n    e_end_val = min(dep_nh, 645)\n    actual_duration = max(0, e_end_val - s_start_val)\n\n    print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n    print(f\"Leave Fisherman's Wharf at: {time_dep_fw}\")\n    print(f\"Arrive at Nob Hill at: {time_arr_nh}\")\n    print(f\"Leave Nob Hill at: {time_dep_nh}\")\n    print(f\"Meeting duration: {actual_duration} minutes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The function `minutes_to_time` converts minutes since 9:00 AM into a formatted time string (HH:MM).\n2. **Z3 Variables**: \n   - `t_depart_fw`: Departure time from Fisherman's Wharf (minutes since 9:00 AM).\n   - `t_depart_nh`: Departure time from Nob Hill.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - Departure from Fisherman's Wharf must be after 9:00 AM (`t_depart_fw >= 0`).\n   - Departure from Nob Hill must be after arrival at Nob Hill (`t_depart_nh >= t_arrive_nh`).\n   - The meeting start time (`s_start`) is the maximum of arrival time at Nob Hill and 315 minutes (2:15 PM).\n   - The meeting end time (`e_end`) is the minimum of departure time from Nob Hill and 645 minutes (7:45 PM).\n   - The meeting duration must be at least 90 minutes.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: The solver checks for a feasible schedule. If found, it converts the times to readable format and prints the schedule along with the actual meeting duration.\n5. **Output**: The solution includes departure and arrival times, and the meeting duration to verify the constraint is met. \n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling constraints using Z3 and outputs a feasible schedule that meets Kenneth for the required duration."
