You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michael, Eric and Arthur for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMichael has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nEric's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nArthur has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a time slot for a meeting that fits within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday and does not conflict with the existing schedules of the participants: Michael, Eric, and Arthur. The meeting duration is 30 minutes. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Translate all times into minutes relative to 9:00 AM (i.e., 9:00 AM becomes 0 minutes, 10:00 AM becomes 60 minutes, etc.).\n2. **Define Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start between 0 minutes (9:00 AM) and 450 minutes (4:30 PM) to ensure it ends by 5:00 PM.\n   - For each participant's busy intervals, ensure the meeting does not overlap. This is done by verifying that the meeting either ends before the busy interval starts or starts after the busy interval ends.\n3. **Use Z3 Solver**: Utilize the Z3 theorem prover to find a start time that satisfies all constraints.\n4. **Convert Back to Time**: Once a valid start time (in minutes) is found, convert it back to the 24-hour format for the output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize variables\n    s = Int('start')\n    duration = 30\n    total_minutes_in_work_day = 8 * 60  # 9:00 to 17:00 is 8 hours = 480 minutes\n\n    # Constraints: meeting must start between 0 and (480 - duration) minutes\n    constraints = [s >= 0, s <= total_minutes_in_work_day - duration]\n\n    # Michael's busy intervals (in minutes from 9:00)\n    michael_busy = [\n        (30, 90),    # 9:30-10:30\n        (360, 390),  # 15:00-15:30\n        (420, 450)   # 16:00-16:30\n    ]\n    for start_busy, end_busy in michael_busy:\n        constraints.append(Or(s + duration <= start_busy, s >= end_busy))\n\n    # Eric has no busy intervals\n\n    # Arthur's busy intervals (in minutes from 9:00)\n    arthur_busy = [\n        (0, 180),    # 9:00-12:00\n        (240, 360),  # 13:00-15:00\n        (390, 420),  # 15:30-16:00\n        (450, 480)   # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n    for start_busy, end_busy in arthur_busy:\n        constraints.append(Or(s + duration <= start_busy, s >= end_busy))\n\n    # Solve constraints\n    solver = Solver()\n    solver.add(constraints)\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_val = model[s].as_long()\n        # Convert start time from minutes to HH:MM format\n        start_hour = 9 + start_val // 60\n        start_minute = start_val % 60\n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        # Calculate end time\n        end_val = start_val + duration\n        end_hour = 9 + end_val // 60\n        end_minute = end_val % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All times are converted into minutes starting from 9:00 AM (e.g., 10:30 AM becomes 90 minutes).\n2. **Constraints Setup**:\n   - The meeting must start between 0 and 450 minutes (inclusive) to fit within the 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM window.\n   - For each busy interval of Michael and Arthur, constraints ensure the meeting does not overlap (i.e., the meeting ends before the busy interval starts or starts after it ends).\n3. **Z3 Solver**: The solver checks all constraints to find a valid start time. If found, it converts the start time from minutes back to HH:MM format.\n4. **Output**: The solution is printed in the specified format, showing the meeting day (Monday), start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to find a suitable meeting time that accommodates all participants' schedules."
