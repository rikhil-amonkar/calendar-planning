You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for John and Jennifer for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJohnhas no meetings the whole week.\nJennifer has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nJohn would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 14:30. Tuesday. Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a 30-minute meeting between John and Jennifer within their work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. The solution must respect Jennifer's existing meetings and John's preference to avoid meetings on Monday after 14:30.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Participants**: John and Jennifer.\n   - **Meeting Duration**: 30 minutes.\n   - **Available Days**: Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - Jennifer's existing meetings (busy slots) on each day.\n     - John's preference to avoid meetings on Monday after 14:30.\n   - **Objective**: Find a 30-minute slot where both participants are free, adhering to all constraints.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Jennifer's Busy Slots**: Convert her meeting times into minute-based intervals from midnight for easier computation.\n   - **John's Preference**: Treat as a hard constraint; any meeting on Monday must end by 14:30.\n   - **Z3 Solver**: Use constraints to ensure the meeting:\n     - Starts and ends within work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n     - Does not overlap with Jennifer's busy slots on the chosen day.\n     - On Monday, ends by 14:30.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Z3 Solver**: A constraint solver that efficiently finds feasible solutions by modeling the problem with integer variables and logical constraints.\n   - **Variables**:\n     - `d`: Day of the week (0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday).\n     - `start_time`: Meeting start time in minutes from midnight.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - Day must be one of Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n     - Start time must be between 9:00 (540 minutes) and 16:30 (990 minutes) to ensure the meeting ends by 17:00.\n     - For each day, ensure the meeting does not overlap with Jennifer's busy intervals.\n     - On Monday, ensure the meeting ends by 14:30 (870 minutes).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The constraints are linear and the solution space is small (3 days and limited time slots), making the problem tractable for Z3.\n   - Z3 efficiently checks feasible solutions without explicit enumeration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize solver\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Define variables\n    d = Int('d')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n    start_time = Int('start_time')  # in minutes from midnight\n    \n    # Constraints for day and time boundaries\n    solver.add(Or(d == 0, d == 1, d == 2))\n    solver.add(start_time >= 540)  # 9:00\n    solver.add(start_time <= 990)  # 16:30 (so that meeting ends by 17:00)\n    \n    # Jennifer's busy intervals in minutes from midnight\n    # Monday: [540,660], [690,780], [810,870], [900,1020]\n    monday_constraints = And(\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 540, start_time >= 660),\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 690, start_time >= 780),\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 810, start_time >= 870),\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 900, start_time >= 1020),\n        start_time + 30 <= 870  # John's preference: end by 14:30 (870 minutes)\n    )\n    \n    # Tuesday: [540,690], [720,1020]\n    tuesday_constraints = And(\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 540, start_time >= 690),\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 720, start_time >= 1020)\n    )\n    \n    # Wednesday: [540,690], [720,750], [780,840], [870,960], [990,1020]\n    wednesday_constraints = And(\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 540, start_time >= 690),\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 720, start_time >= 750),\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 780, start_time >= 840),\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 870, start_time >= 960),\n        Or(start_time + 30 <= 990, start_time >= 1020)\n    )\n    \n    # Apply day-specific constraints\n    solver.add(If(d == 0, monday_constraints, \n                  If(d == 1, tuesday_constraints, \n                     wednesday_constraints)))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        day_val = model[d].as_long()\n        start_minutes = model[start_time].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert day value to string\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_str = days[day_val]\n        \n        # Convert start time to HH:MM format\n        hours = start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + 30\n        end_hours = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes %= 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle constraints.\n2. **Variables**:\n   - `d` represents the day (0, 1, 2 for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday).\n   - `start_time` is the meeting start time in minutes from midnight.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - Day must be one of the specified days.\n   - Start time must be between 9:00 (540 minutes) and 16:30 (990 minutes).\n   - Day-specific constraints ensure the meeting avoids Jennifer's busy slots and respects John's preference on Monday.\n4. **Solution Extraction**:\n   - If a solution exists, the day and start/end times are converted to readable formats.\n   - The solution is printed in the required format: day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the Z3 solver to find a feasible meeting time that adheres to all given constraints."
