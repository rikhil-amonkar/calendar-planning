You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Eugene and Eric for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nEugene is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:30, Friday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30; \nEric is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 17:00, Friday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00; \n\nEric would like to avoid more meetings on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a suitable 30-minute meeting slot between Eugene and Eric within their work hours (9:00 to 17:00) from Monday to Friday. The solution must respect their existing busy schedules and Eric's preference to avoid Wednesday if possible. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves finding a 30-minute window where both participants are free. The constraints include:\n   - Work hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (480 minutes from 9:00).\n   - Busy intervals for Eugene and Eric on specific days.\n   - Eric's preference to avoid Wednesday if another day is available.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Convert time to minutes from 9:00 for easier arithmetic. For each day, check if there's a 30-minute slot free for both participants. Prioritize days other than Wednesday to respect Eric's preference.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Use the Z3 solver to model the problem as constraints:\n   - **Variables**: `day` (0-4 for Monday-Friday) and `start_minutes` (0-450, ensuring the meeting ends by 17:00).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - The meeting must fit within work hours.\n     - The meeting must not overlap with any busy interval for either participant.\n     - Prefer days other than Wednesday if possible.\n\n4. **Optimization**: First, attempt to find a solution excluding Wednesday. If none exists, include Wednesday in the search.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    day = Int('day')\n    start_minutes = Int('start_minutes')\n    \n    base_constraints = [\n        day >= 0,\n        day <= 4,\n        start_minutes >= 0,\n        start_minutes <= 450  # 450 + 30 = 480 (17:00)\n    ]\n    \n    eugene_busy = {\n        0: [(120, 180), (270, 300), (330, 360), (420, 450)],  # Monday\n        2: [(0, 30), (120, 150), (180, 210), (270, 360)],    # Wednesday\n        3: [(30, 60), (120, 210)],                           # Thursday\n        4: [(90, 120), (180, 210), (240, 270)]               # Friday\n    }\n    \n    eric_busy = {\n        0: [(0, 480)],   # Monday\n        1: [(0, 480)],   # Tuesday\n        2: [(0, 150), (180, 300), (330, 450)],  # Wednesday\n        3: [(0, 480)],   # Thursday\n        4: [(0, 120), (150, 480)]   # Friday\n    }\n    \n    def free_slot(start, intervals):\n        cond = True\n        for (s_busy, e_busy) in intervals:\n            cond = And(cond, Or(start + 30 <= s_busy, start >= e_busy))\n        return cond\n    \n    eugene_cond = True\n    for d, intervals in eugene_busy.items():\n        eugene_cond = And(eugene_cond, If(day == d, free_slot(start_minutes, intervals), True))\n    \n    eric_cond = True\n    for d, intervals in eric_busy.items():\n        eric_cond = And(eric_cond, If(day == d, free_slot(start_minutes, intervals), True))\n    \n    s1 = Solver()\n    s1.add(base_constraints)\n    s1.add(eugene_cond)\n    s1.add(eric_cond)\n    s1.add(day != 2)  # Avoid Wednesday if possible\n    \n    if s1.check() == sat:\n        m = s1.model()\n    else:\n        s2 = Solver()\n        s2.add(base_constraints)\n        s2.add(eugene_cond)\n        s2.add(eric_cond)\n        if s2.check() == sat:\n            m = s2.model()\n        else:\n            print(\"No solution found\")\n            return\n    \n    day_val = m.eval(day).as_long()\n    start_minutes_val = m.eval(start_minutes).as_long()\n    \n    total_minutes = start_minutes_val\n    hours = total_minutes // 60\n    minutes = total_minutes % 60\n    start_hour = 9 + hours\n    start_min = minutes\n    start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_min:02d}\"\n    \n    end_minutes_val = start_minutes_val + 30\n    end_hours = 9 + (end_minutes_val // 60)\n    end_minutes = end_minutes_val % 60\n    end_time = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n    \n    days_map = {\n        0: \"Monday\",\n        1: \"Tuesday\",\n        2: \"Wednesday\",\n        3: \"Thursday\",\n        4: \"Friday\"\n    }\n    day_str = days_map[day_val]\n    \n    print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n    print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n    print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n    print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: \n   - `day` represents the day of the week (0-4 for Monday-Friday).\n   - `start_minutes` is the meeting start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 to 450, ensuring the meeting ends by 17:00).\n\n2. **Busy Intervals**: \n   - Eugene's and Eric's busy intervals are converted to minutes from 9:00 and stored in dictionaries per day.\n\n3. **Free Slot Check**: \n   - The `free_slot` function checks if a 30-minute meeting slot doesn't overlap with any busy interval for a participant.\n\n4. **Solver Setup**:\n   - **Solver 1**: Tries to find a solution excluding Wednesday.\n   - **Solver 2**: If Solver 1 fails, includes Wednesday in the search.\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - The solution is formatted into the required day, start time, and end time (in 24-hour format).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down possible meeting times while respecting all constraints and preferences, leveraging the Z3 solver for constraint satisfaction."
