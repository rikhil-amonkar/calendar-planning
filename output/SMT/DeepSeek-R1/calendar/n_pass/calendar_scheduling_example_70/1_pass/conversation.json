You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Denise, Angela and Natalie for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDenise has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nAngelahas no meetings the whole day.\nNatalie is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find the earliest possible 30-minute time slot within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday that accommodates the busy schedules of all participants: Denise, Angela, and Natalie. Angela has no meetings, so her schedule is entirely free within the work hours. Denise and Natalie have specific busy intervals that must be avoided.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent each time in minutes starting from 9:00 (0 minutes) to 17:00 (480 minutes) for easier calculations.\n2. **Define Constraints**:\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must start at or after 9:00 (0 minutes) and end by 17:00 (start time + 30 minutes \u2264 480 minutes).\n   - **Denise's Busy Intervals**: \n     - 12:00 to 12:30 (180 to 210 minutes): The meeting must either end by 12:00 (start + 30 \u2264 180) or start after 12:30 (start \u2265 210).\n     - 15:30 to 16:00 (390 to 420 minutes): The meeting must either end by 15:30 (start + 30 \u2264 390) or start after 16:00 (start \u2265 420).\n   - **Natalie's Busy Intervals**:\n     - 9:00 to 11:30 (0 to 150 minutes): The meeting must start at or after 11:30 (start \u2265 150).\n     - 12:00 to 13:00 (180 to 240 minutes): The meeting must either end by 12:00 (start + 30 \u2264 180) or start after 13:00 (start \u2265 240).\n     - 14:00 to 14:30 (300 to 330 minutes): The meeting must either end by 14:00 (start + 30 \u2264 300) or start after 14:30 (start \u2265 330).\n     - 15:00 to 17:00 (360 to 480 minutes): The meeting must end by 15:00 (start + 30 \u2264 360) since starting after 17:00 is impossible within work hours.\n3. **Optimize for Earliest Start Time**: Use the Z3 solver to find the smallest start time (in minutes) that satisfies all constraints.\n4. **Convert Back to Time Format**: Once the earliest start time in minutes is found, convert it back to HH:MM format by adding the minutes to 9:00.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    s = Int('s')\n    opt = Optimize()\n    \n    # Work hours: 9:00 (0 minutes) to 17:00 (480 minutes)\n    opt.add(s >= 0)\n    opt.add(s + 30 <= 480)\n    \n    # Denise's constraints\n    opt.add(Or(s + 30 <= 180, s >= 210))  # Avoid 12:00-12:30\n    opt.add(Or(s + 30 <= 390, s >= 420))  # Avoid 15:30-16:00\n    \n    # Natalie's constraints\n    opt.add(s >= 150)  # Avoid 9:00-11:30\n    opt.add(Or(s + 30 <= 180, s >= 240))  # Avoid 12:00-13:00\n    opt.add(Or(s + 30 <= 300, s >= 330))  # Avoid 14:00-14:30\n    opt.add(Or(s + 30 <= 360, s >= 480))  # Avoid 15:00-17:00 (s>=480 is impossible but included for completeness)\n    \n    opt.minimize(s)\n    \n    if opt.check() == sat:\n        model = opt.model()\n        start_minutes = model[s].as_long()\n        \n        # Calculate start time in HH:MM\n        start_hour = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        start_min = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_min:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time (start_minutes + 30)\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + 30\n        end_hour = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_min = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_min:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to find an integer variable `s` representing the start time in minutes from 9:00.\n2. **Constraints Setup**:\n   - The meeting must fit within the workday (9:00 to 17:00), translating to `s` between 0 and 450 minutes (since 480 - 30 = 450).\n   - Denise's busy intervals are converted into constraints ensuring the meeting does not overlap with her scheduled meetings.\n   - Natalie's busy intervals are similarly converted, with additional constraints to ensure the meeting starts after her last free period.\n3. **Optimization**: The solver minimizes `s` to find the earliest possible start time that meets all constraints.\n4. **Time Conversion**: The solution in minutes is converted back to a readable HH:MM format by adding the minutes to 9:00 and formatting the result with leading zeros if necessary.\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed in the specified format, indicating the meeting day (Monday), start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to find the earliest feasible meeting time while respecting all participants' schedules."
