You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Doris, Theresa, Christian, Terry, Carolyn and Kyle for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDoris has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nTheresa has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 12:00; \nChristianhas no meetings the whole day.\nTerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nCarolyn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \nKyle has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that fits into the existing schedules of all participants: Doris, Theresa, Christian, Terry, Carolyn, and Kyle. Christian has no meetings, so his schedule doesn't impose any constraints. The solution involves converting each participant's blocked time intervals into minutes relative to 9:00 and then using the Z3 solver to find a start time that doesn't overlap with any blocked intervals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time Intervals to Minutes**: Each blocked time interval (e.g., \"9:00 to 11:00\") is converted into minutes starting from 9:00 as the reference point (0 minutes). For example, 9:00 becomes 0 minutes, 10:00 becomes 60 minutes, etc.\n2. **Define Constraints**: The meeting must start between 0 minutes (9:00) and 450 minutes (16:30) to ensure it ends by 17:00. For each participant's blocked intervals, the meeting time must not overlap. This means the meeting must either end before a blocked interval starts or start after the blocked interval ends.\n3. **Use Z3 Solver**: The Z3 solver is used to find a start time `S` (in minutes) that satisfies all constraints. The constraints ensure that for every blocked interval `[A, B)` of each participant, either the meeting ends before `A` (`S + 30 <= A`) or starts after `B` (`S >= B`).\n4. **Convert Solution to Time**: Once the solver finds a feasible start time `S`, it is converted back to the time of day by adding `S` minutes to 9:00.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 minutes = 9:00)\n    S = Int('S')\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Total available time: 9:00 (0 min) to 17:00 (480 min)\n    # Meeting must end by 480 min -> S <= 480 - 30 = 450\n    s.add(S >= 0)\n    s.add(S <= 450)\n    \n    # Define busy intervals for each person in minutes (relative to 9:00)\n    # Each interval is (start, end) in minutes [start inclusive, end exclusive)\n    busy_times = {\n        'Doris': [\n            (0, 120),    # 9:00-11:00\n            (270, 300),  # 13:30-14:00\n            (420, 450)   # 16:00-16:30\n        ],\n        'Theresa': [\n            (60, 180)    # 10:00-12:00\n        ],\n        'Terry': [\n            (30, 60),    # 9:30-10:00\n            (150, 180),  # 11:30-12:00\n            (210, 240),  # 12:30-13:00\n            (270, 300),  # 13:30-14:00\n            (330, 360),  # 14:30-15:00\n            (390, 480)   # 15:30-17:00\n        ],\n        'Carolyn': [\n            (0, 90),     # 9:00-10:30\n            (120, 150),  # 11:00-11:30\n            (180, 240),  # 12:00-13:00\n            (270, 330),  # 13:30-14:30\n            (360, 480)   # 15:00-17:00\n        ],\n        'Kyle': [\n            (0, 30),     # 9:00-9:30\n            (150, 180),  # 11:30-12:00\n            (210, 240),  # 12:30-13:00\n            (330, 480)   # 14:30-17:00\n        ]\n    }\n    \n    # Christian has no meetings, so no constraints\n    \n    # Add constraints for each person's busy intervals\n    for person, intervals in busy_times.items():\n        for (A, B) in intervals:\n            # The meeting [S, S+30) must not overlap with [A, B)\n            # So either: meeting ends before A starts, or meeting starts after B ends\n            s.add(Or(S + meeting_duration <= A, S >= B))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_minutes = model[S].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert minutes back to time string\n        hours = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # End time is start time + 30 minutes\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + 30\n        end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        print(f\"Monday {start_time} to {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The blocked time intervals for each participant are converted into minutes relative to 9:00. For example, \"9:00 to 11:00\" becomes `(0, 120)`.\n2. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver is initialized with a variable `S` representing the meeting start time in minutes. Constraints ensure `S` is within working hours (0 to 450 minutes).\n3. **Non-overlap Constraints**: For each blocked interval `[A, B)`, the solver ensures the meeting `[S, S+30)` does not overlap by requiring `S+30 <= A` or `S >= B`.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start time in minutes is converted back to a readable time format (e.g., `14:00`). The end time is simply the start time plus 30 minutes.\n5. **Output**: The solution prints the meeting time in the format \"Monday HH:MM to HH:MM\".\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to find a feasible meeting time that accommodates all participants' schedules."
