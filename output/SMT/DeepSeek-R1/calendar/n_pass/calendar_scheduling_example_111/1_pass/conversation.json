You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Gregory, Natalie, Christine and Vincent for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nGregory has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00; \nNatalie's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nChristine has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 17:00; \nVincent has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday that accommodates the busy schedules of Gregory, Natalie, Christine, and Vincent. The solution involves converting time intervals into minutes from a reference point (9:00), defining constraints using the Z3 solver, and finding a valid meeting start time that avoids all participants' busy slots.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: All time intervals are converted into minutes relative to 9:00 (e.g., 9:00 becomes 0 minutes, 10:00 becomes 60 minutes).\n2. **Define Busy Slots**: Each participant's busy intervals are converted into minute ranges.\n3. **Set Up Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start within the workday (0 to 480 minutes, since 17:00 is 8 hours after 9:00).\n   - The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so the end time is `start + 30`.\n   - For each participant, the meeting must not overlap with any of their busy slots. This means the meeting must either end before a busy slot starts or start after a busy slot ends.\n4. **Use Z3 Solver**: The Z3 solver checks for a start time that satisfies all constraints. If found, it converts the start time back to HH:MM format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define start time variable in minutes from 9:00\n    start = Int('start')\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Constraint: meeting within work hours (9:00 to 17:00)\n    s.add(start >= 0)\n    s.add(start + meeting_duration <= 480)  # 17:00 is 480 minutes from 9:00\n    \n    # Busy slots in minutes from 9:00\n    gregory_busy = [(0, 60), (90, 150), (210, 240), (270, 300)]\n    christine_busy = [(0, 150), (270, 480)]\n    vincent_busy = [(0, 30), (90, 180), (210, 300), (330, 480)]\n    # Natalie has no busy slots\n    \n    # Function to add constraints for a participant's busy slots\n    def add_busy_constraints(busy_slots):\n        constraints = []\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_slots:\n            # Meeting must be either before the busy slot or after it\n            constraints.append(Or(start + meeting_duration <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n        s.add(And(constraints))\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant with busy slots\n    add_busy_constraints(gregory_busy)\n    add_busy_constraints(christine_busy)\n    add_busy_constraints(vincent_busy)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_minutes = m[start].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes back to time string\n        hours = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All time intervals are converted into minutes starting from 9:00 (e.g., 10:30 becomes 90 minutes).\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting:\n   - Starts at or after 9:00 (0 minutes) and ends by 17:00 (480 minutes).\n   - Avoids all busy slots for Gregory, Christine, and Vincent. Natalie has no busy slots, so no constraints are added for her.\n3. **Z3 Solver**: The solver checks for a feasible start time that meets all constraints. If found, it converts the start time from minutes back to HH:MM format.\n4. **Output**: The solution is printed in the required format, specifying the day (Monday), start time, and end time of the meeting.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to find a meeting slot that fits within all participants' schedules, ensuring optimal use of available time."
