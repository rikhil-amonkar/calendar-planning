You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Martha and Beverly for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMartha has blocked their calendar on Monday during 16:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 15:00 to 15:30, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 14:00 to 14:30; \nBeverly has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a meeting between two participants, Martha and Beverly, within their available work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on specified days (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday). The meeting duration is one hour, and we must ensure the chosen time does not conflict with their existing blocked schedules. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find a 1-hour slot where both participants are free. Each participant has specific blocked time intervals on different days. The solution must respect these blocks and the work hours constraint.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: \n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must start and end within 9:00 to 17:00.\n   - **Blocked Intervals**: The meeting must not overlap with any blocked intervals of either participant on the chosen day.\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**: \n   - **Day Variable**: An integer variable (0, 1, 2) representing Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n   - **Start Time Variable**: An integer representing minutes from 9:00 (0 to 420, ensuring the meeting ends by 17:00).\n4. **Non-overlap Conditions**: For each blocked interval of a participant on a specific day, ensure the meeting either ends before the block starts or starts after the block ends.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: Once the solver finds a feasible day and start time, convert the start time to HH:MM format and compute the end time by adding 60 minutes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import Solver, Int, Or, If, And\n\ndef main():\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define variables\n    d = Int('d')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n    start_minutes = Int('start_minutes')  # minutes from 9:00\n    \n    # Constraints for day and start time\n    s.add(d >= 0, d <= 2)\n    s.add(start_minutes >= 0, start_minutes <= 420)  # 420 minutes = 7 hours -> 9:00 + 7h = 16:00, so meeting ends at 17:00\n    \n    # Martha's blocked intervals (day, start_min, end_min)\n    martha_intervals = [\n        (0, 420, 480),   # Monday: 16:00 to 17:00\n        (1, 360, 390),   # Tuesday: 15:00 to 15:30\n        (2, 60, 120),    # Wednesday: 10:00 to 11:00\n        (2, 300, 330)    # Wednesday: 14:00 to 14:30\n    ]\n    \n    # Beverly's blocked intervals\n    beverly_intervals = [\n        (0, 0, 270),     # Monday: 9:00 to 13:30\n        (0, 300, 480),   # Monday: 14:00 to 17:00\n        (1, 0, 480),     # Tuesday: entire day (9:00 to 17:00)\n        (2, 30, 390),    # Wednesday: 9:30 to 15:30\n        (2, 450, 480)    # Wednesday: 16:30 to 17:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Add constraints for Martha's intervals\n    for (day, s_start, s_end) in martha_intervals:\n        s.add(If(d == day, Or(start_minutes + 60 <= s_start, start_minutes >= s_end), True)\n    \n    # Add constraints for Beverly's intervals\n    for (day, s_start, s_end) in beverly_intervals:\n        s.add(If(d == day, Or(start_minutes + 60 <= s_start, start_minutes >= s_end), True)\n    \n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == z3.sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        d_val = model[d].as_long()\n        start_val = model[start_minutes].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert day value to string\n        days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n        day_str = days[d_val]\n        \n        # Calculate start time in HH:MM\n        total_minutes = start_val\n        hours = total_minutes // 60\n        minutes = total_minutes % 60\n        start_hour = 9 + hours\n        start_min = minutes\n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_minutes = start_val + 60\n        end_hour = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_min = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_min:02d}\"\n        \n        # Print solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to handle constraints.\n2. **Variables**: \n   - `d` represents the day (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, 2 for Wednesday).\n   - `start_minutes` represents the meeting start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 to 420, ensuring the meeting ends by 17:00).\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - **Day Constraint**: `d` must be 0, 1, or 2.\n   - **Start Time Constraint**: `start_minutes` must be between 0 and 420 minutes.\n   - **Non-overlap Constraints**: For each blocked interval of Martha and Beverly on a specific day, the meeting must either end before the block starts or start after the block ends.\n4. **Solution Extraction**:\n   - **Day Conversion**: The integer day value is converted to a string (e.g., 0 becomes \"Monday\").\n   - **Time Conversion**: The start time in minutes is converted to HH:MM format by adding to 9:00. The end time is computed by adding 60 minutes to the start time.\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed in the specified format, showing the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the Z3 solver to navigate constraints and find a feasible meeting slot, ensuring all given conditions are met."
