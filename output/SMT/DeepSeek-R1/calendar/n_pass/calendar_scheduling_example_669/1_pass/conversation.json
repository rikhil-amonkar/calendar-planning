You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jean and Doris for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJean is busy on Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDoris has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nDoris would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a meeting between Jean and Doris that adheres to their existing schedules, the meeting duration, and Doris's preference to avoid meetings after 14:00 on Monday. The solution must be within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The meeting must be scheduled for 30 minutes during 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday or Tuesday. Doris is busy all day on Tuesday, so the meeting must be on Monday. Jean has no constraints on Monday. Doris's schedule on Monday has free slots at 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, and 16:00-16:30. However, Doris prefers not to meet after 14:00, so we exclude the 16:00-16:30 slot.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: \n   - **Day Constraint**: The meeting must be on Monday (0) or Tuesday (1). Tuesday is infeasible due to Doris's schedule.\n   - **Time Constraint**: The meeting must start between 9:00 and 16:30 (since it ends by 17:00).\n   - **Jean's Constraints**: On Tuesday, avoid 11:30-12:00 and 16:00-16:30. No constraints on Monday.\n   - **Doris's Constraints**: On Monday, the meeting must fit into free slots (11:30-12:00 or 12:30-13:30) and end by 14:00.\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**: Use integer variables for the day and start time (in minutes from 9:00). Add constraints to ensure the meeting fits within the available slots and respects preferences.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: Convert the solver's output to the required day and time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Create solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Variables: day (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday), start_minute (minutes from 9:00)\n    day = Int('day')\n    start_minute = Int('start_minute')\n    \n    # Day must be Monday (0) or Tuesday (1)\n    s.add(Or(day == 0, day == 1))\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes, so start_minute must be between 0 and 450 (since 480 - 30 = 450)\n    s.add(start_minute >= 0)\n    s.add(start_minute <= 450)\n    \n    # Jean's constraints: only on Tuesday\n    # Avoid 11:30-12:00 (150 to 180 minutes from 9:00) and 16:00-16:30 (420 to 450 minutes)\n    jean_tue = Or(\n        start_minute + 30 <= 150,  # Meeting ends by 11:30\n        And(start_minute >= 180, start_minute + 30 <= 420),  # Between 12:00 and 16:00\n        start_minute >= 450  # At or after 16:30\n    )\n    s.add(If(day == 1, jean_tue, True))  # Only apply if Tuesday\n    \n    # Doris's constraints\n    # On Monday: free slots are 11:30-12:00 (150 to 180 minutes) and 12:30-13:30 (210 to 270 minutes)\n    doris_mon = Or(\n        And(150 <= start_minute, start_minute < 180),\n        And(210 <= start_minute, start_minute < 270)\n    )\n    # On Tuesday: no free time (entire day busy)\n    doris_tue = False\n    s.add(If(day == 0, doris_mon, doris_tue))\n    \n    # Doris's preference: on Monday, meeting must end by 14:00 (300 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(If(day == 0, start_minute + 30 <= 300, True))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        d = m[day].as_long()\n        sm = m[start_minute].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert day to string\n        day_str = \"Monday\" if d == 0 else \"Tuesday\"\n        \n        # Calculate start time in HH:MM\n        start_hour = 9 + sm // 60\n        start_min = sm % 60\n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_min:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time (start time + 30 minutes)\n        end_minutes = sm + 30\n        end_hour = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_min = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_min:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Solver Initialization**: The Z3 solver is initialized to find constraints that satisfy the scheduling problem.\n2. **Variables**: \n   - `day` represents the meeting day (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday).\n   - `start_minute` is the meeting start time in minutes from 9:00.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must be on Monday or Tuesday.\n   - The meeting must start between 9:00 and 16:30 to end by 17:00.\n   - On Tuesday, Jean's busy periods (11:30-12:00 and 16:00-16:30) are avoided.\n   - On Monday, Doris's free slots (11:30-12:00 and 12:30-13:30) are considered, and the meeting must end by 14:00.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: The solver checks for a feasible solution. If found, it converts the day and start minute into readable formats (day string and HH:MM times) and prints the meeting details.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the feasible meeting times using constraint programming with Z3, ensuring all given constraints and preferences are met."
