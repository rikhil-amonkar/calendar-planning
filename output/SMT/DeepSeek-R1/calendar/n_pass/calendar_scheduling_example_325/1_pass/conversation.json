You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jose, Keith, Logan, Megan, Gary and Bobby for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJose has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nKeith has meetings on Monday during 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nLogan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nMegan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 16:30; \nGary has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30; \nBobby is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 16:00; \n\nJose do not want to meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot for six participants (Jose, Keith, Logan, Megan, Gary, and Bobby) on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The solution must accommodate each participant's existing busy times and additional constraints (e.g., Jose cannot meet after 15:30).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Translate all time slots into minutes relative to 9:00 AM (e.g., 9:00 becomes 0 minutes, 10:00 becomes 60 minutes, etc.).\n2. **Define Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start between 0 and 450 minutes (9:00 AM to 4:30 PM) to ensure it ends by 5:00 PM.\n   - Jose's constraint: the meeting must end by 15:30 (390 minutes from 9:00 AM).\n3. **Model Busy Intervals**: For each participant, list their busy intervals in minutes.\n4. **Non-overlap Conditions**: For each busy interval, ensure the meeting does not overlap by requiring the meeting to either end before the busy interval starts or start after the busy interval ends.\n5. **Use Z3 Solver**: Utilize the Z3 theorem prover to find a start time that satisfies all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 minutes = 9:00)\n    S = Int('S')\n    s.add(S >= 0, S <= 450)  # Meeting must start between 9:00 and 16:30\n    \n    # Jose's constraint: meeting must end by 15:30 (390 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(S + 30 <= 390)\n    \n    # Busy intervals for each participant (start and end in minutes from 9:00)\n    jose_busy = [(120, 150), (210, 240)]\n    keith_busy = [(300, 330), (360, 390)]\n    logan_busy = [(0, 60), (180, 210)]\n    megan_busy = [(0, 90), (120, 180), (240, 270), (330, 450)]\n    gary_busy = [(0, 30), (60, 90), (150, 240), (270, 300), (330, 450)]\n    bobby_busy = [(120, 150), (180, 210), (240, 420)]\n    \n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    all_busy = jose_busy + keith_busy + logan_busy + megan_busy + gary_busy + bobby_busy\n    \n    # Add constraints: meeting [S, S+30] must not overlap with any busy interval [b_start, b_end]\n    for (b_start, b_end) in all_busy:\n        s.add(Or(S + 30 <= b_start, S >= b_end))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_minutes = model.eval(S).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes back to time string (from minutes since 9:00)\n        total_minutes = start_minutes\n        hours = total_minutes // 60\n        minutes = total_minutes % 60\n        start_hour = 9 + hours\n        start_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time (start_minutes + 30)\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + 30\n        end_hours = end_minutes // 60\n        end_mins = end_minutes % 60\n        end_hour = 9 + end_hours\n        end_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_mins:02d}\"\n        \n        # Print the solution in the required format\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All times are converted into minutes relative to 9:00 AM for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The meeting start time `S` is constrained to be between 0 and 450 minutes (9:00 AM to 4:30 PM). Additionally, Jose's constraint ensures the meeting ends by 15:30 (390 minutes from 9:00 AM).\n3. **Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are listed in minutes. For example, Jose's first meeting from 11:00 to 11:30 is converted to (120, 150) minutes.\n4. **Non-overlap Condition**: For each busy interval, the solver ensures the meeting either ends before the interval starts or starts after the interval ends.\n5. **Solution Extraction**: If a valid start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format. The solution is printed with the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling problem using constraints and leverages the Z3 solver to find a feasible meeting time that accommodates all participants' schedules and constraints."
