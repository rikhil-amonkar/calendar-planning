You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ryan and Adam for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nRyan has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 12:00 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nAdam is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nRyan can not meet on Wednesday. Adam would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:30. Tuesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a 30-minute meeting between Ryan and Adam within their work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on either Monday or Tuesday (since Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday). The solution must respect their existing schedules and Adam's preference to avoid meetings on Monday before 14:30 if possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves finding a 30-minute window where both Ryan and Adam are free. The meeting must occur between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday or Tuesday. Ryan's existing meetings on these days and Adam's existing meetings, along with his preference to avoid Monday meetings before 14:30, are key constraints.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Convert the given schedules into time intervals (in minutes from 9:00) for each day. For each day, check intervals where both participants are free. The solution should first try to honor Adam's preference (avoid Monday before 14:30) by prioritizing Tuesday or Monday after 14:30. If no such slot exists, consider Monday before 14:30.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Use the Z3 solver to model the constraints. Define integer variables for the meeting day (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday) and start time (in minutes from 9:00). The constraints ensure the meeting does not overlap with any existing meetings and fits within the work hours. The preference is added as an additional constraint, which is relaxed if no solution is found initially.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The Z3 solver efficiently handles the constraints, which are linear inequalities over integer variables. The complexity is manageable given the small number of constraints (busy intervals) and variables.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Convert busy times to minutes from 9:00\n    # Monday\n    ryan_busy_m = [(30,60), (120,180), (240,270), (390,420)]\n    adam_busy_m = [(0,90), (120,270), (300,420), (450,480)]\n    # Tuesday\n    ryan_busy_t = [(150,210), (390,420)]\n    adam_busy_t = [(0,60), (90,390), (420,480)]\n    \n    # Create solver and variables\n    day = Int('day')\n    start = Int('start')\n    \n    # Domain constraints\n    constraints = [\n        Or(day == 0, day == 1),\n        start >= 0,\n        start <= 450  # because 17:00 is 480 minutes, 480-30=450\n    ]\n    \n    # Monday constraints: not overlapping with any busy interval for Ryan or Adam\n    monday_constraints = []\n    for s, e in ryan_busy_m:\n        monday_constraints.append(Or(start + 30 <= s, start >= e))\n    for s, e in adam_busy_m:\n        monday_constraints.append(Or(start + 30 <= s, start >= e))\n    monday_case = And(day == 0, *monday_constraints)\n    \n    # Tuesday constraints\n    tuesday_constraints = []\n    for s, e in ryan_busy_t:\n        tuesday_constraints.append(Or(start + 30 <= s, start >= e))\n    for s, e in adam_busy_t:\n        tuesday_constraints.append(Or(start + 30 <= s, start >= e))\n    tuesday_case = And(day == 1, *tuesday_constraints)\n    \n    # Overall constraint: either Monday or Tuesday works\n    constraints.append(Or(monday_case, tuesday_case))\n    \n    # Preference constraint: avoid Monday before 14:30 (330 minutes from 9:00)\n    preference = Or(day != 0, start >= 330)\n    \n    # First try with preference\n    s1 = Solver()\n    s1.add(constraints)\n    s1.add(preference)\n    \n    if s1.check() == sat:\n        m = s1.model()\n    else:\n        s2 = Solver()\n        s2.add(constraints)\n        if s2.check() == sat:\n            m = s2.model()\n        else:\n            print(\"No solution found\")\n            return\n\n    d = m[day].as_long()\n    st_val = m[start].as_long()\n    \n    # Convert start time to HH:MM\n    total_minutes_start = st_val\n    start_hour = 9 + total_minutes_start // 60\n    start_minute = total_minutes_start % 60\n    start_time_str = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n    \n    # End time is start time + 30 minutes\n    total_minutes_end = st_val + 30\n    end_hour = 9 + total_minutes_end // 60\n    end_minute = total_minutes_end % 60\n    end_time_str = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n    \n    day_str = \"Monday\" if d == 0 else \"Tuesday\"\n    \n    print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n    print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n    print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n    print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Setup**: The existing schedules for Ryan and Adam are converted into time intervals in minutes from 9:00 for Monday and Tuesday.\n2. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver uses integer variables for the meeting day and start time. Constraints ensure the meeting fits within work hours and avoids existing meetings.\n3. **Preference Handling**: The solver first tries to find a solution that avoids Monday before 14:30. If no solution is found, it relaxes this constraint.\n4. **Output**: The solution is printed in the required format, showing the day, start time, and end time in 24-hour format with two-digit hours and minutes.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down possible meeting times using constraint solving, ensuring all hard constraints are met while respecting preferences where possible."
