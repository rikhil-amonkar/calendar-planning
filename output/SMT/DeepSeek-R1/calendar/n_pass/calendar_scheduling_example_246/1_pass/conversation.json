        "content": "Given the following scheduling problem:\nYou are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jacob, Diana, Adam, Angela and Dennis for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJacob is busy on Monday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nDiana has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nAdam has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nAngela is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDennis has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday that accommodates all participants' busy schedules. The solution involves converting time intervals to minutes for easier manipulation, defining constraints to ensure the meeting does not overlap with any participant's busy times, and using the Z3 solver to find a feasible start time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Each time slot is converted into minutes past midnight for uniformity. For example, 9:00 becomes 540 minutes.\n2. **Define Meeting Constraints**: The meeting must start between 9:00 (540 minutes) and 16:30 (990 minutes) to ensure it ends by 17:00.\n3. **Model Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are converted into minute ranges.\n4. **Non-overlap Constraints**: For each participant's busy interval, ensure the meeting slot (S to S+30) does not overlap by requiring either the meeting ends before the busy interval starts or starts after the busy interval ends.\n5. **Solve with Z3**: Use the Z3 solver to find a start time S that satisfies all constraints. Convert the solution back to HH:MM format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time variable (in minutes)\n    S = Int('S')\n    \n    # Meeting duration is 30 minutes\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Work hours: 9:00 (540) to 17:00 (1020)\n    work_start = 540\n    work_end = 1020\n    \n    # Constraint: meeting must start between 9:00 and 16:30 (so that it ends by 17:00)\n    s.add(S >= work_start, S <= work_end - meeting_duration)\n    \n    # Busy intervals for each person in minutes\n    # Jacob\n    jacob_busy = [(13*60+30, 14*60), (14*60+30, 15*60)]\n    # Diana\n    diana_busy = [(9*60+30, 10*60), (11*60+30, 12*60), (13*60, 13*60+30), (16*60, 16*60+30)]\n    # Adam\n    adam_busy = [(9*60+30, 10*60+30), (11*60, 12*60+30), (15*60+30, 16*60)]\n    # Angela\n    angela_busy = [(9*60+30, 10*60), (10*60+30, 12*60), (13*60, 15*60+30), (16*60, 16*60+30)]\n    # Dennis\n    dennis_busy = [(9*60, 9*60+30), (10*60+30, 11*60+30), (13*60, 15*60), (16*60+30, 17*60)]\n    \n    # Combine all busy intervals\n    all_busy = jacob_busy + diana_busy + adam_busy + angela_busy + dennis_busy\n    \n    # For each busy interval, add constraint that meeting does not overlap\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in all_busy:\n        s.add(Or(S + meeting_duration <= busy_start, S >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Check if there's a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_minutes = model.eval(S).as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes to HH:MM\n        start_hour = start_minutes // 60\n        start_minute = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hour = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All time slots are converted to minutes past midnight (e.g., 9:00 becomes 540 minutes) for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting starts between 9:00 and 16:30 (540 to 990 minutes) to fit within work hours.\n3. **Non-overlap Conditions**: For each participant's busy interval, the solver checks that the meeting either ends before the interval starts or starts after it ends.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format. The meeting end time is simply the start time plus 30 minutes.\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed in the specified format, indicating the day (Monday), start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving, ensuring the solution meets all given scheduling constraints."
