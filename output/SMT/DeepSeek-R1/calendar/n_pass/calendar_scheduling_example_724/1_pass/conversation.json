You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Tyler and Ruth for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nTyler is busy on Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:30 to 15:00, Wednesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nRuth has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nTyler would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a meeting between Tyler and Ruth that fits within their existing schedules and constraints. The meeting must last 30 minutes and occur between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Additionally, Tyler prefers to avoid meetings on Monday before 16:00.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Participants**: Tyler and Ruth.\n   - **Meeting Duration**: 30 minutes.\n   - **Available Days**: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (work hours 9:00 to 17:00).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Ruth's Busy Times**:\n       - Monday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-14:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n       - Tuesday: Entire day (9:00-17:00).\n       - Wednesday: Entire day (9:00-17:00).\n     - **Tyler's Busy Times**:\n       - Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 14:30-15:00.\n       - Wednesday: 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 16:30-17:00.\n     - **Tyler's Preference**: Avoid meetings on Monday before 16:00.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Ruth is unavailable all day on Tuesday and Wednesday, so the meeting must be scheduled on Monday.\n   - On Monday, Ruth has available slots at 10:00-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 14:30-15:00, and 16:00-16:30.\n   - Tyler's preference restricts the meeting to start at or after 16:00 on Monday, leaving only the 16:00-16:30 slot available.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Use the Z3 solver to model the problem constraints and find a feasible meeting time.\n   - Represent days as integers (0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday).\n   - Represent start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 to 480 minutes).\n   - Define constraints based on participants' busy times and Tyler's preference.\n   - Solve the constraints to find the meeting day and start time.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The Z3 solver efficiently handles the constraints, which are linear and limited, making the solution feasible even for larger schedules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Create solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define variables\n    day = Int('day')  # 0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday\n    start_minutes = Int('start_minutes')  # minutes from 9:00, range [0, 450] (since meeting is 30 min and must end by 17:00)\n    \n    # Basic constraints for day and start time\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 2)\n    s.add(start_minutes >= 0, start_minutes <= 450)  # 450 = 480 -

`day` represents the meeting day (0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday).\n   - `start_minutes` represents the meeting start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 to 450, ensuring the meeting ends by 17:00).\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - **Monday**: The meeting must fit within Ruth's available slots and start at or after 16:00 (Tyler's preference).\n   - **Tuesday and Wednesday**: Ruth is busy all day, so no feasible meeting times exist.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: \n   - The solver checks for a feasible solution. If found, it converts the day and start time to human-readable format.\n   - The start and end times are calculated by converting minutes back to the 24-hour format.\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed in the required format, specifying the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving, ensuring all given constraints are satisfied."
