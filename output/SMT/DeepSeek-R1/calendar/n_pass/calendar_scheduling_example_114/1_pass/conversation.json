You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Stephanie, Cheryl, Bradley and Steven for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nStephanie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nCheryl has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBradley has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nSteven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we use the Z3 theorem prover to find a one-hour meeting slot that fits within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday and avoids all participants' busy intervals. The solution involves converting time to minutes past 9:00, defining constraints for each participant's busy periods, and ensuring the meeting lies entirely within free time.\n\n```python\nfrom z3 import Int, Or, And, Solver, sat\n\n# Convert time string to minutes past 9:00\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return (hours - 9) * 60 + minutes\n\n# Convert minutes back to time string\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    total_minutes = minutes\n    hours = 9 + total_minutes // 60\n    minutes = total_minutes % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Meeting duration in minutes\n    duration = 60\n    \n    # Define busy intervals for each participant (converted to minutes past 9:00)\n    stephanie_busy = [(time_to_minutes(\"10:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"10:30\")),\n                      (time_to_minutes(\"16:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"16:30\"))]\n    \n    cheryl_busy = [(time_to_minutes(\"10:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"10:30\")),\n                   (time_to_minutes(\"11:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"12:00\")),\n                   (time_to_minutes(\"13:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"14:00\")),\n                   (time_to_minutes(\"16:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"17:00\"))]\n    \n    bradley_busy = [(time_to_minutes(\"9:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"10:00\")),\n                    (time_to_minutes(\"10:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"11:30\")),\n                    (time_to_minutes(\"13:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"14:00\")),\n                    (time_to_minutes(\"14:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"15:00\")),\n                    (time_to_minutes(\"15:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"17:00\"))]\n    \n    steven_busy = [(time_to_minutes(\"9:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"12:00\")),\n                   (time_to_minutes(\"13:00\"), time_to_minutes(\"13:30\")),\n                   (time_to_minutes(\"14:30\"), time_to_minutes(\"17:00\"))]\n    \n    # Z3 variables and solver\n    s = Int('start_time')\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Global constraints: meeting within 9:00-17:00\n    solver.add(s >= 0)                     # Start at or after 9:00\n    solver.add(s + duration <= 8 * 60)     # End at or before 17:00 (480 minutes)\n    \n    # Avoid busy intervals for each participant\n    def add_busy_constraints(busy_intervals):\n        for start, end in busy_intervals:\n            # Meeting must be entirely before or after each busy interval\n            solver.add(Or(s + duration <= start, s >= end))\n    \n    add_busy_constraints(stephanie_busy)\n    add_busy_constraints(cheryl_busy)\n    add_busy_constraints(bradley_busy)\n    add_busy_constraints(steven_busy)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model[s].as_long()\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + duration\n        \n        # Convert to time strings\n        start_time = minutes_to_time(start_minutes)\n        end_time = minutes_to_time(end_minutes)\n        \n        print(f\"Monday {start_time} to {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **Time Conversion:** The `time_to_minutes` function converts HH:MM times to minutes past 9:00 (e.g., 10:00 becomes 60 minutes). The `minutes_to_time` function reverses this.\n2. **Busy Intervals:** Each participant's busy intervals are converted into minute ranges relative to 9:00.\n3. **Z3 Constraints:**\n   - The meeting start time `s` must be \u22650 (after 9:00) and end by 480 minutes (17:00).\n   - For each busy interval `[start, end]`, the meeting must either end before `start` or start after `end`.\n4. **Solution Extraction:** The Z3 solver finds a valid start time. If found, it converts the start and end times back to HH:MM format and prints the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds a meeting time that respects all constraints using declarative programming with Z3."
