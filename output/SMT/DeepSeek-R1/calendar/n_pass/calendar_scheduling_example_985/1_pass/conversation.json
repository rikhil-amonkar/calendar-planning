You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diane and Matthew for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nDiane is busy on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 15:30, Tuesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 15:30 to 16:30, Friday during 9:30 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \nMatthew has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 16:00, Friday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nMatthew would rather not meet on Wednesday before 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a one-hour meeting between Diane and Matthew within their work hours (9:00 to 17:00) from Monday to Friday. The solution must respect their existing busy schedules and Matthew's preference to avoid meeting before 12:30 on Wednesday. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Busy Schedules**: Convert the given busy schedules of Diane and Matthew into a structured format where each day maps to a list of busy intervals (start and end times in minutes since midnight).\n2. **Set Up Constraints**: \n   - The meeting must start between 9:00 (540 minutes) and 16:00 (960 minutes) to ensure it ends by 17:00 (1020 minutes).\n   - The day must be one of Monday to Friday (represented as integers 0 to 4).\n   - If the meeting is on Wednesday (day 2), it must start at or after 12:30 (750 minutes).\n   - The meeting interval (start to start+60 minutes) must not overlap with any busy interval of either participant on the chosen day.\n3. **Use Z3 Solver**: Utilize the Z3 theorem prover to find a day and start time that satisfies all constraints. The solver checks each possible day and start time combination against the constraints derived from the busy schedules.\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once a solution is found, convert the start time from minutes back to HH:MM format and print the day, start time, and end time in the required format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport re\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    h, m = time_str.split(':')\n    return int(h) * 60 + int(m)\n\ndef parse_busy_string(s):\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n    pattern = '|'.join(days)\n    tokens = re.split(f'({pattern})', s)\n    busy_dict = {day: [] for day in days}\n    for i in range(len(tokens)):\n        if tokens[i] in days:\n            day_name = tokens[i]\n            if i + 1 < len(tokens):\n                content = tokens[i + 1]\n                intervals = []\n                parts = content.split(',')\n                for part in parts:\n                    part = part.strip()\n                    if part == '':\n                        continue\n                    if ' to ' in part:\n                        times = part.split(' to ', 1)\n                        t1 = times[0].strip()\n                        t2 = times[1].strip()\n                        try:\n                            start_min = time_to_minutes(t1)\n                            end_min = time_to_minutes(t2)\n                            intervals.append((start_min, end_min))\n                        except:\n                            continue\n                busy_dict[day_name] = intervals\n    return busy_dict\n\ndef main():\n    diane_input = \"Diane is busy on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 15:30, Tuesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 15:30 to 16:30, Friday during 9:30 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00\"\n    matthew_input = \"Matthew has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 16:00, Friday during 9:00 to 17:00\"\n    \n    diane_busy = parse_busy_string(diane_input)\n    matthew_busy = parse_busy_string(matthew_input)\n    \n    day = Int('day')\n    start_minutes = Int('start_minutes')\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 4)\n    s.add(start_minutes >= 540)\n    s.add(start_minutes <= 960)\n    \n    s.add(Implies(day == 2, start_minutes >= 750))\n    \n    day_names = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n    for d in range(5):\n        day_name = day_names[d]\n        if day_name in diane_busy:\n            for (bs, be) in diane_busy[day_name]:\n                s.add(Implies(day == d, Or(start_minutes + 60 <= bs, start_minutes >= be)))\n        if day_name in matthew_busy:\n            for (bs, be) in matthew_busy[day_name]:\n                s.add(Implies(day == d, Or(start_minutes + 60 <= bs, start_minutes >= be)))\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        d_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start_minutes].as_long()\n        end_val = start_val + 60\n        day_name = day_names[d_val]\n        start_hour = start_val // 60\n        start_minute = start_val % 60\n        end_hour = end_val // 60\n        end_minute = end_val % 60\n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        end_time = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_name}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Parsing Schedules**: The `parse_busy_string` function processes the input strings for Diane and Matthew, converting their busy times into a dictionary where each day maps to a list of busy intervals (each interval is a tuple of start and end times in minutes).\n2. **Z3 Setup**: The Z3 solver is initialized with variables for the meeting day (0-4 representing Monday-Friday) and start time (in minutes). Constraints ensure the meeting fits within work hours and avoids busy intervals.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start between 9:00 (540 minutes) and 16:00 (960 minutes).\n   - On Wednesday (day 2), the meeting must start at or after 12:30 (750 minutes).\n   - For each day, the meeting interval must not overlap with any busy interval of either participant.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the solver returns the day and start time. The start time is converted back to HH:MM format, and the end time is calculated by adding 60 minutes. The solution is printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving, ensuring all given conditions are met."
