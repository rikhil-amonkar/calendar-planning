You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Danielle, Bruce and Eric for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDanielle has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBruce has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nEric has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a one-hour meeting slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that accommodates the existing schedules of Danielle, Bruce, and Eric. The solution involves converting time to minutes for easier manipulation, defining constraints using the Z3 solver, and ensuring the meeting does not overlap with any existing commitments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Translate all time slots into minutes from a reference point (9:00 as 0 minutes).\n2. **Define Meeting Constraints**: The meeting must start and end within working hours (0 to 480 minutes) and last exactly 60 minutes.\n3. **Avoid Overlapping Meetings**: For each participant, ensure the proposed meeting does not overlap with their existing meetings by checking that the meeting is either entirely before or after each existing slot.\n4. **Solve with Z3**: Use the Z3 solver to find a valid start time that satisfies all constraints.\n5. **Convert Back to Time**: Once a solution is found, convert the start time from minutes back to HH:MM format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 minutes = 9:00)\n    start = Int('start')\n    duration = 60\n    end = start + duration\n    \n    # Working hours: 9:00 (0 min) to 17:00 (480 min)\n    s.add(start >= 0)\n    s.add(end <= 480)\n    \n    # Danielle's meetings: converted to minutes\n    danielle_meetings = [\n        (0, 60),    # 9:00-10:00\n        (90, 120),   # 10:30-11:00\n        (330, 360),  # 14:30-15:00\n        (390, 420),  # 15:30-16:00\n        (450, 480)   # 16:30-17:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Bruce's meetings\n    bruce_meetings = [\n        (120, 150), # 11:00-11:30\n        (210, 240), # 12:30-13:00\n        (300, 330), # 14:00-14:30\n        (390, 420)  # 15:30-16:00\n    ]\n    \n    # Eric's meetings\n    eric_meetings = [\n        (0, 30),    # 9:00-9:30\n        (60, 120),  # 10:00-11:00\n        (150, 240), # 11:30-13:00\n        (330, 390)  # 14:30-15:30\n    ]\n    \n    # Function to add non-overlap constraints for each person's meetings\n    def add_non_overlap(meetings):\n        for meet_start, meet_end in meetings:\n            s.add(Or(end <= meet_start, start >= meet_end))\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    add_non_overlap(danielle_meetings)\n    add_non_overlap(bruce_meetings)\n    add_non_overlap(eric_meetings)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_min = m[start].as_long()\n        # Convert minutes back to time string\n        hours = 9 + start_min // 60\n        minutes = start_min % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        end_min = start_min + 60\n        end_hours = 9 + end_min // 60\n        end_minutes = end_min % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        print(f\"Monday {start_time} to {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All times are converted into minutes relative to 9:00 (e.g., 10:30 becomes 90 minutes).\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting starts after 9:00 and ends before 17:00, lasting exactly 60 minutes.\n3. **Non-overlap Handling**: For each existing meeting of every participant, the solver checks that the new meeting is scheduled either entirely before or after the existing slot.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a valid start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format for readability. The solution outputs the meeting time in the required format (e.g., \"Monday 13:00 to 14:00\").\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint programming with Z3 to find a feasible meeting time that respects all participants' existing schedules within the specified work hours."
