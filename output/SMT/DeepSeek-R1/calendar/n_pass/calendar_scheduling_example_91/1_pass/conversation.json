You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Danielle, Bruce and Eric for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDanielle has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBruce has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nEric has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a one-hour time slot within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday that is free for all participants: Danielle, Bruce, and Eric. The solution involves checking their existing meeting schedules and ensuring the proposed meeting time does not overlap with any of their commitments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent each participant's busy intervals in minutes starting from 9:00 (e.g., 9:00 becomes 0 minutes, 10:00 becomes 60 minutes, etc.).\n2. **Define Constraints**: The meeting must start between 0 minutes (9:00) and 420 minutes (16:00) to ensure it ends by 17:00.\n3. **Non-overlapping Conditions**: For each participant, ensure the meeting time does not overlap with any of their busy intervals. This is done by checking that either the meeting ends before a busy interval starts or the meeting starts after the busy interval ends.\n4. **Use Z3 Solver**: Utilize the Z3 theorem prover to find a valid start time that satisfies all constraints.\n5. **Convert Solution to Time Format**: Once a valid start time (in minutes) is found, convert it back to the 24-hour time format for the output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    s = Int('s')\n    \n    # Convert busy times to minutes from 9:00\n    # Danielle's meetings\n    danielle = [(0, 60), (90, 120), (330, 360), (390, 420), (450, 480)]\n    # Bruce's meetings\n    bruce = [(120, 150), (210, 240), (300, 330), (390, 420)]\n    # Eric's meetings\n    eric = [(0, 30), (60, 120), (150, 240), (330, 390)]\n    \n    all_busy = [danielle, bruce, eric]\n    \n    constraints = [s >= 0, s <= 420]  # Meeting must start by 16:00 to end by 17:00\n    \n    for person in all_busy:\n        for interval in person:\n            a, b = interval\n            constraints.append(Or(s + 60 <= a, s >= b))\n    \n    solver = Solver()\n    solver.add(constraints)\n    \n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model.eval(s).as_long()\n        \n        # Calculate start time (HH:MM)\n        start_hour = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        start_minute = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time (start_minutes + 60 minutes)\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + 60\n        end_hour = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The busy intervals for each participant are converted into minutes relative to 9:00. For example, Danielle's meeting from 9:00 to 10:00 becomes the interval (0, 60).\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver is constrained to find a start time `s` between 0 (9:00) and 420 (16:00) minutes. This ensures the meeting ends by 17:00.\n3. **Non-overlapping Check**: For each participant's busy interval, the solver checks that the meeting either ends before the interval starts (`s + 60 <= a`) or starts after the interval ends (`s >= b`).\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a valid start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format. For instance, 240 minutes becomes 13:00 (since 9:00 + 4 hours = 13:00). The end time is simply the start time plus 60 minutes.\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed in the specified format, indicating the day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to find a suitable meeting time that accommodates all participants' schedules."
