You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Wayne, Melissa, Catherine, Gregory, Victoria, Thomas and Jennifer for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nWayne is free the entire day.\nMelissa has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nCatherine is free the entire day.\nGregory has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nVictoria is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \nThomas has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:00; \nJennifer has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nWayne would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 that accommodates all participants' existing schedules and constraints. The participants are Wayne, Melissa, Catherine, Gregory, Victoria, Thomas, and Jennifer. Wayne has a preference to avoid meetings before 14:00, which we treat as a hard constraint initially. If no solution is found with this constraint, we relax it and search for any available slot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent all times in minutes starting from 9:00 (i.e., 9:00 is 0 minutes, 10:00 is 60 minutes, etc.).\n2. **Define Busy Intervals**: For each participant, list their busy intervals during the day in minutes.\n3. **Set Up Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start between 0 and 450 minutes (9:00 to 16:30) to ensure it ends by 17:00.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any participant's busy intervals.\n   - Wayne's preference: the meeting should start at or after 14:00 (300 minutes).\n4. **Check for Solution with Preference**:\n   - Use the Z3 solver to find a meeting time that satisfies all constraints, including Wayne's preference.\n5. **Check Without Preference if Needed**:\n   - If no solution is found with Wayne's preference, solve without this constraint.\n6. **Convert Solution to Time Format**: Once a start time is found, convert it back to HH:MM format for the output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Convert time to minutes from 9:00\n    def time_to_minutes(time_str):\n        h, m = time_str.split(':')\n        return int(h) * 60 + int(m) - 9 * 60  # Offset from 9:00\n\n    # Busy intervals for each participant in minutes from 9:00\n    busy_intervals = {\n        'Melissa': [(time_to_minutes('10:00'), time_to_minutes('11:00')),\n                    (time_to_minutes('12:30'), time_to_minutes('14:00')),\n                    (time_to_minutes('15:00'), time_to_minutes('15:30'))],\n        'Catherine': [],\n        'Gregory': [(time_to_minutes('12:30'), time_to_minutes('13:00')),\n                    (time_to_minutes('15:30'), time_to_minutes('16:00'))],\n        'Victoria': [(time_to_minutes('09:00'), time_to_minutes('09:30')),\n                     (time_to_minutes('10:30'), time_to_minutes('11:30')),\n                     (time_to_minutes('13:00'), time_to_minutes('14:00')),\n                     (time_to_minutes('14:30'), time_to_minutes('15:00')),\n                     (time_to_minutes('15:30'), time_to_minutes('16:30'))],\n        'Thomas': [(time_to_minutes('10:00'), time_to_minutes('12:00')),\n                   (time_to_minutes('12:30'), time_to_minutes('13:00')),\n                   (time_to_minutes('14:30'), time_to_minutes('16:00'))],\n        'Jennifer': [(time_to_minutes('09:00'), time_to_minutes('09:30')),\n                     (time_to_minutes('10:00'), time_to_minutes('10:30')),\n                     (time_to_minutes('11:00'), time_to_minutes('13:00')),\n                     (time_to_minutes('13:30'), time_to_minutes('14:30')),\n                     (time_to_minutes('15:00'), time_to_minutes('15:30')),\n                     (time_to_minutes('16:00'), time_to_minutes('16:30'))],\n        'Wayne': []  # No meetings, but preference to avoid before 14:00\n    }\n\n    # Create solver and start time variable\n    start = Int('start')\n    s1 = Solver()\n    s2 = Solver()\n\n    # Basic constraints: meeting within 9:00-17:00 and duration 30 minutes\n    s1.add(start >= 0)\n    s1.add(start <= 450)  # 17:00 -

If none is found, it checks without the preference.\n6. **Output**: The solution is converted back to HH:MM format and printed in the required format, showing the meeting day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible meeting times while respecting both hard constraints (busy intervals) and soft constraints (preferences), ensuring an optimal solution is found."
