You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Wayne, Melissa, Catherine, Gregory, Victoria, Thomas and Jennifer for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nWayne is free the entire day.\nMelissa has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nCatherine is free the entire day.\nGregory has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nVictoria is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \nThomas has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:00; \nJennifer has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nWayne would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot that accommodates all participants' existing schedules and constraints within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. The solution must respect each participant's busy times and Wayne's preference to avoid meetings before 14:00.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent all times as minutes from 9:00 (e.g., 9:00 is 0 minutes, 10:00 is 60 minutes, etc.).\n2. **Define Busy Intervals**: For each participant, list their busy intervals in minutes from 9:00.\n3. **Set Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start and end within the working day (9:00 to 17:00), so the start time must be between 0 and 450 minutes (inclusive).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any participant's busy intervals.\n   - Wayne's preference requires the meeting to start at or after 14:00 (300 minutes from 9:00).\n4. **Use Z3 Solver**: Model the problem using Z3's integer solver to find a start time that satisfies all constraints.\n5. **Convert Solution to Time**: Once a valid start time is found, convert it back to HH:MM format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import Solver, Int, Or, And\n\ndef main():\n    s = Solver()\n    start = Int('start')\n    \n    # Meeting duration in minutes\n    duration = 30\n    \n    # Total working minutes (9:00 to 17:00 is 480 minutes)\n    max_start = 480 - duration  # 450 minutes (17:00 - 30 minutes)\n    \n    # Constraint: meeting must be within working hours\n    s.add(start >= 0, start <= max_start)\n    \n    # Wayne's preference: avoid before 14:00 (14:00 is 300 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(start >= 300)\n    \n    # Busy intervals for each participant (in minutes from 9:00)\n    busy_intervals = [\n        # Melissa\n        (60, 120), (210, 300), (360, 390),\n        # Gregory\n        (210, 240), (390, 420),\n        # Victoria\n        (0, 30), (90, 150), (240, 300), (330, 360), (390, 450),\n        # Thomas\n        (60, 180), (210, 240), (330, 420),\n        # Jennifer\n        (0, 30), (60, 90), (120, 240), (270, 330), (360, 390), (420, 450)\n    ]\n    \n    # Add constraints for each busy interval\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in busy_intervals:\n        # The meeting must not overlap: either entirely before or entirely after the busy interval\n        s.add(Or(\n            start + duration <= busy_start,\n            start >= busy_end\n        ))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_minutes = model[start].as_long()\n        # Convert start_minutes to time string\n        hours = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + duration\n        end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        print(f\"Monday {start_time} to {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All times are converted into minutes relative to 9:00 to simplify arithmetic operations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting:\n   - Fits within the 9:00 to 17:00 window.\n   - Starts at or after 14:00 (300 minutes from 9:00) per Wayne's preference.\n   - Avoids all specified busy intervals for each participant by ensuring no overlap.\n3. **Z3 Solver**: The solver checks all constraints to find a feasible start time. If found, it converts the start time from minutes back to HH:MM format and prints the meeting slot (start and end times).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times by leveraging constraint solving, ensuring all participants' schedules and preferences are respected."
