You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Deborah and Albert for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDeborah is free the entire day.\nAlbert has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 15:00 to 16:30; \n\nAlbert can not meet on Monday after 11:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a meeting between Deborah and Albert that adheres to their constraints. The meeting must be 30 minutes long, scheduled between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Deborah has no conflicts, but Albert has specific blocked times and cannot meet after 11:00. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent all times in minutes relative to 9:00 (i.e., 9:00 is 0 minutes).\n2. **Define Constraints**:\n   - **Work Hours**: The meeting must start between 0 minutes (9:00) and 450 minutes (16:30) to ensure it ends by 17:00.\n   - **Albert's Constraint**: The meeting must end by 11:00, which is 120 minutes from 9:00. Thus, the start time plus 30 minutes must be \u2264 120.\n   - **Blocked Times**: Albert has blocked intervals: 9:00-10:00 (0-60 minutes), 10:30-12:00 (90-180 minutes), and 15:00-16:30 (360-450 minutes). The meeting must not overlap with these intervals.\n3. **Use Z3 Solver**: Model the start time as an integer variable and apply the constraints using the Z3 solver to find a feasible start time.\n4. **Convert Back to Time**: Once a solution is found, convert the start time from minutes back to a 24-hour time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Reference: 9:00 is 0 minutes\n    work_start_min = 0\n    work_end_min = 8 * 60  # 17:00 is 480 minutes from 9:00\n    duration = 30  # Meeting duration in minutes\n    \n    # Albert cannot meet after 11:00, which is 120 minutes from 9:00\n    albert_deadline = 2 * 60  # 120 minutes\n    \n    # Blocked times represented as half-open intervals [start, end)\n    blocked_intervals = [\n        (0, 60),    # 9:00-10:00\n        (90, 180),  # 10:30-12:00\n        (360, 450)  # 15:00-16:30\n    ]\n    \n    # Initialize Z3 solver and variable\n    s = Solver()\n    start_time_min = Int('start_time_min')\n    \n    # Constraints\n    # Meeting must start within work hours and end by 17:00\n    s.add(start_time_min >= work_start_min)\n    s.add(start_time_min <= work_end_min - duration)\n    \n    # Meeting must end by 11:00 (Albert's constraint)\n    s.add(start_time_min + duration <= albert_deadline)\n    \n    # Meeting must not overlap any blocked interval\n    for (b_start, b_end) in blocked_intervals:\n        s.add(Or(start_time_min + duration <= b_start, start_time_min >= b_end))\n    \n    # Check for solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_min_val = model[start_time_min].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start time back to HH:MM format\n        total_min = 9 * 60 + start_min_val\n        hours = total_min // 60\n        minutes = total_min % 60\n        start_time_str = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_min_val = start_min_val + duration\n        total_end_min = 9 * 60 + end_min_val\n        hours_end = total_end_min // 60\n        minutes_end = total_end_min % 60\n        end_time_str = f\"{hours_end:02d}:{minutes_end:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time_str}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time_str}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All times are converted into minutes relative to 9:00 to simplify arithmetic operations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**:\n   - The meeting must fit within the workday (9:00 to 17:00), ensuring it starts by 16:30 at the latest.\n   - Albert's constraint requires the meeting to end by 11:00, translating to a start time no later than 10:30.\n   - Blocked intervals are checked to ensure no overlap with the meeting time. Each interval is treated as half-open (end-exclusive) to avoid boundary overlaps.\n3. **Z3 Solver**: The solver finds a start time that satisfies all constraints. The solution is converted back to HH:MM format for readability.\n4. **Output**: The solution is printed in the specified format, indicating the meeting day, start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling constraints using the Z3 solver, ensuring an optimal and feasible meeting time is found."
