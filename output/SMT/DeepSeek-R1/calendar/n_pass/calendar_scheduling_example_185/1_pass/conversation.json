You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kimberly, Megan, Marie and Diana for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMeganhas no meetings the whole day.\nMarie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDiana is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nMegan would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 10:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that accommodates the busy schedules of all participants (Kimberly, Megan, Marie, and Diana) while respecting Megan's preference to avoid meetings before 10:00. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert all given time slots into minutes relative to 9:00 AM for easier arithmetic operations. For example, 10:00 AM becomes 60 minutes (since 10:00 AM is 60 minutes after 9:00 AM).\n2. **Define Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start at or after 10:00 AM (60 minutes).\n   - The meeting must end by 5:00 PM (480 minutes), so the latest start time is 4:30 PM (450 minutes).\n   - The meeting duration is exactly 30 minutes.\n   - The meeting should not overlap with any participant's existing busy intervals. For each busy interval `[start, end)`, the meeting must either end before `start` or start after `end`.\n3. **Use Z3 Solver**: Utilize the Z3 theorem prover to find a start time that satisfies all constraints. The solver checks possible start times within the valid range (60 to 450 minutes) against all busy intervals of each participant.\n4. **Convert Solution Back to Time**: Once a valid start time is found, convert it back to the HH:MM format for the start and end times of the meeting.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Int('s')\n    solver = Solver()\n    \n    # Meeting must be between 9:00 and 17:00, duration 30 minutes.\n    # Also, Megan's preference: avoid before 10:00, so start at or after 10:00 (60 minutes from 9:00).\n    solver.add(s >= 60)\n    solver.add(s <= 450)  # because 450 + 30 = 480 (17:00)\n    \n    # Define busy intervals for each participant in minutes from 9:00 (start inclusive, end exclusive)\n    kimberly_busy = [(60, 90), (120, 180), (420, 450)]\n    marie_busy = [(60, 120), (150, 360), (420, 450)]\n    diana_busy = [(30, 60), (90, 330), (390, 480)]\n    \n    # Add constraints for Kimberly\n    for (b_start, b_end) in kimberly_busy:\n        solver.add(Or(s + 30 <= b_start, s >= b_end))\n    \n    # Add constraints for Marie\n    for (b_start, b_end) in marie_busy:\n        solver.add(Or(s + 30 <= b_start, s >= b_end))\n    \n    # Add constraints for Diana\n    for (b_start, b_end) in diana_busy:\n        solver.add(Or(s + 30 <= b_start, s >= b_end))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        m = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = m[s].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes back to time string\n        total_minutes_from_midnight_start = 9 * 60 + start_minutes\n        hours_start = total_minutes_from_midnight_start // 60\n        minutes_start = total_minutes_from_midnight_start % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours_start}:{minutes_start:02d}\"\n        \n        end_minutes = start_minutes + 30\n        total_minutes_from_midnight_end = 9 * 60 + end_minutes\n        hours_end = total_minutes_from_midnight_end // 60\n        minutes_end = total_minutes_from_midnight_end % 60\n        end_time = f\"{hours_end}:{minutes_end:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output the meeting time\n        print(\"Monday\", start_time, end_time)\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The code converts all time slots into minutes relative to 9:00 AM. For instance, 10:00 AM is represented as 60 minutes.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting starts at or after 10:00 AM (60 minutes) and ends by 5:00 PM (450 minutes start time to allow 30 minutes).\n3. **Busy Intervals Handling**: For each participant's busy intervals, the solver adds constraints ensuring the meeting does not overlap. This is done by checking that the meeting either ends before the busy interval starts or starts after it ends.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a valid start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format. The meeting start and end times are then printed in the required format (e.g., \"Monday 15:00 15:30\").\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible meeting times within the given constraints using the Z3 solver, ensuring an optimal and correct solution is found."
