You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Mary and Alexis for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMary has meetings on Tuesday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30; \nAlexis has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 10:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find the earliest possible time slot for a 30-minute meeting between Mary and Alexis within their work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. The solution must avoid any existing meetings in their schedules and prioritize the earliest available time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Translate all given time slots into minutes relative to 9:00 AM (e.g., 9:00 AM is 0 minutes, 10:00 AM is 60 minutes).\n2. **Define Busy Intervals**: Create dictionaries that list the busy intervals for each participant (Mary and Alexis) for each day.\n3. **Set Up Constraints**: Use the Z3 solver to define variables for the meeting day (0 to 3 representing Monday to Thursday) and start time (0 to 450 minutes, ensuring the meeting ends by 17:00).\n4. **Non-Overlap Conditions**: For each day, ensure the meeting does not overlap with any of Mary's or Alexis's busy intervals.\n5. **Objective Function**: Minimize a weighted sum of the day and start time to find the earliest possible meeting slot.\n6. **Convert Solution**: Translate the solution back into the required day and time format (HH:MM).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Convert time string to minutes from 9:00\n    def time_to_minutes(time_str):\n        h, m = time_str.split(':')\n        return (int(h) -
