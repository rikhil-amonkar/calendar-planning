You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Cheryl and James for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nCheryl's calendar is wide open the entire week.\nJames has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 16:00, Thursday during 9:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nCheryl would rather not meet on Wednesday. Thursday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find the earliest possible time slot for a 30-minute meeting between Cheryl and James within their work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Cheryl's calendar is completely free, but James has several meetings on each day. Additionally, Cheryl prefers not to meet on Wednesday or Thursday. The solution must respect all constraints and find the earliest available time slot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key is to find a 30-minute slot where James is free during the specified work hours. Cheryl's availability is unrestricted except for her preference to avoid Wednesday and Thursday, which we handle by prioritizing earlier days (Monday and Tuesday) in the optimization.\n2. **Modeling with Z3**: We use the Z3 solver to model the problem. The variables are:\n   - `D`: Day of the week (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, 2 for Wednesday, 3 for Thursday).\n   - `T`: Start time in minutes from midnight of the respective day.\n   - `S`: Absolute start time in minutes from Monday 00:00, used to find the earliest slot.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - `D` must be between 0 and 3 (representing Monday to Thursday).\n   - `T` must be between 540 (9:00) and 990 (16:30) to ensure the meeting ends by 17:00.\n   - For each day, if `D` matches, the meeting time `[T, T+30)` must not overlap any of James's busy intervals on that day.\n4. **Optimization**: Minimize `S` (absolute start time) to find the earliest feasible slot. This naturally prioritizes Monday and Tuesday over Wednesday and Thursday, aligning with Cheryl's preference.\n5. **Output**: Convert the solution to the required format (day, start time, end time).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Define variables\n    D = Int('D')\n    T = Int('T')\n    S = D * (24 * 60) + T  # absolute start time in minutes from Monday 00:00\n\n    # Constraints list\n    constraints = [\n        Or(D == 0, D == 1, D == 2, D == 3),  # Day must be Mon, Tue, Wed, or Thu\n        T >= 540,  # 9:00 in minutes\n        T <= 990   # 16:30 in minutes (since meeting ends at 17:00)\n    ]\n\n    # Busy intervals for James per day (start, end) in minutes of the day (half-open intervals [start, end))\n    busy = {\n        0: [(540, 570), (630, 660), (750, 780), (870, 930), (990, 1020)],  # Monday\n        1: [(540, 660), (690, 720), (750, 930), (960, 1020)],  # Tuesday\n        2: [(600, 660), (720, 780), (810, 960)],  # Wednesday\n        3: [(570, 690), (720, 750), (780, 810), (840, 870), (990, 1020)]   # Thursday\n    }\n\n    # For each day, add constraints to avoid overlapping with busy intervals\n    for day, intervals in busy.items():\n        day_constraints = []\n        for start, end in intervals:\n            # Meeting [T, T+30) must not overlap with [start, end): either ends before start or starts after end\n            day_constraints.append(Or(T + 30 <= start, T >= end))\n        # If D is this day, apply the constraints for all intervals\n        constraints.append(If(D == day, And(day_constraints), True))\n\n    # Use Optimize to minimize S (earliest time)\n    opt = Optimize()\n    opt.add(constraints)\n    opt.minimize(S)\n\n    # Check for a solution\n    if opt.check() == sat:\n        m = opt.model()\n        d_val = m.eval(D).as_long()\n        t_val = m.eval(T).as_long()\n        days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday']\n        day_str = days[d_val]\n        # Format start time (HH:MM)\n        start_hour = t_val // 60\n        start_minute = t_val % 60\n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        # Calculate end time (start time + 30 minutes)\n        end_minutes = t_val + 30\n        end_hour = end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        # Output the solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: The Z3 solver is used to define day (`D`) and start time (`T`) variables. The absolute start time (`S`) is minimized to find the earliest slot.\n2. **Busy Intervals**: James's busy intervals for each day are predefined. The meeting must not overlap any of these intervals.\n3. **Non-overlap Condition**: For each day, if selected, the meeting time must not intersect any busy interval. This is enforced by ensuring the meeting either ends before a busy interval starts or starts after it ends.\n4. **Optimization**: The solver minimizes `S`, ensuring the earliest possible meeting time. This inherently respects Cheryl's preference for earlier days (Monday or Tuesday) by their lower `S` values.\n5. **Output**: The solution is formatted to show the day, start time, and end time in 24-hour format, meeting all specified constraints and preferences."
