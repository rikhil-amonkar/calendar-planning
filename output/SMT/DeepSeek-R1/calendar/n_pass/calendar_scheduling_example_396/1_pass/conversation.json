You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Andrea, Jack, Madison, Rachel, Douglas and Ryan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAndrea's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nJack has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:00 to 14:30; \nMadison has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nRachel is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nDouglas is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 16:30; \nRyan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot that fits within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday for all participants: Andrea, Jack, Madison, Rachel, Douglas, and Ryan. The solution involves converting each participant's busy intervals into minutes relative to 9:00, then using the Z3 solver to find a start time such that the meeting does not overlap with any busy intervals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: All times are converted into minutes starting from 9:00 as 0 minutes. For example, 10:00 becomes 60 minutes, and 17:00 becomes 480 minutes.\n2. **Define Meeting Constraints**: The meeting duration is 30 minutes, so the start time must be between 0 and 450 minutes (since 450 + 30 = 480, the end of the working day).\n3. **Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are listed in minutes. For instance, Jack's meeting from 9:00 to 9:30 is converted to (0, 30).\n4. **Z3 Solver Setup**: \n   - Initialize an integer variable `s` representing the start time in minutes.\n   - Add constraints ensuring `s` is within valid bounds (0 to 450).\n   - For each participant, add constraints that the meeting interval `[s, s+30]` does not overlap with any of their busy intervals.\n5. **Check Solution**: The solver checks for a feasible start time. If found, convert the start time back to HH:MM format and determine the end time by adding 30 minutes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Convert all times to minutes from 9:00 (so 9:00 is 0, 17:00 is 480)\n    min_start = 0\n    max_end = 480\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    max_start = max_end - meeting_duration  # 450\n\n    # Define busy intervals for each person in minutes\n    andrea_busy = []\n    jack_busy = [(0, 30), (300, 330)]\n    madison_busy = [(30, 90), (240, 300), (360, 390), (450, 480)]\n    rachel_busy = [(30, 90), (120, 150), (180, 270), (330, 390), (420, 480)]\n    douglas_busy = [(0, 150), (180, 450)]\n    ryan_busy = [(0, 30), (240, 300), (330, 480)]\n\n    # Create Z3 solver and variable\n    s = Int('s')\n    solver = Solver()\n    solver.add(s >= min_start, s <= max_start)\n\n    # Function to add constraints for each person\n    def add_busy_constraints(intervals):\n        for a, b in intervals:\n            solver.add(Or(s + meeting_duration <= a, s >= b))\n\n    # Add constraints for each person\n    add_busy_constraints(andrea_busy)\n    add_busy_constraints(jack_busy)\n    add_busy_constraints(madison_busy)\n    add_busy_constraints(rachel_busy)\n    add_busy_constraints(douglas_busy)\n    add_busy_constraints(ryan_busy)\n\n    # Check for solution\n    if solver.check() == sat:\n        model = solver.model()\n        start_minutes = model[s].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes to time string\n        hours = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes_remainder = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes_remainder:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output solution\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All times are converted into minutes from a base time of 9:00. This simplifies arithmetic operations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting starts between 0 and 450 minutes (inclusive) to fit within the 9:00-17:00 window.\n3. **Non-overlap Conditions**: For each participant, the solver checks that the meeting does not overlap with any of their busy intervals. This is done by ensuring the meeting either ends before a busy interval starts or starts after it ends.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a feasible start time is found, it is converted back to HH:MM format. The end time is derived by adding 30 minutes to the start time.\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed in the specified format, indicating the meeting day (Monday), start time, and end time in 24-hour format.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the Z3 solver to handle complex scheduling constraints, ensuring an optimal meeting time that accommodates all participants."
