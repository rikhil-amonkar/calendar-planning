Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kayla and Rebecca for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKayla has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 14:30 to 16:00; \nRebecca has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a one-hour meeting slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that fits within the existing schedules of all participants (Kayla and Rebecca). The solution involves identifying free time slots by avoiding blocked intervals in each participant's calendar and ensuring the meeting fits within the work hours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert all time strings (like \"10:00\") into minutes from a base time (9:00) for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Define Blocked Intervals**: Represent each participant's blocked time intervals as tuples of start and end minutes (from the base time).\n3. **Set Up Constraints**: Use the Z3 solver to define constraints:\n   - The meeting must start after or at 9:00 (0 minutes from base) and end by 17:00 (480 minutes from base).\n   - The meeting duration is exactly 60 minutes.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any blocked interval of any participant. For each blocked interval [a, b), the meeting must either end before `a` or start after `b`.\n4. **Solve Constraints**: Use Z3 to find a valid start time that satisfies all constraints.\n5. **Convert Back to Time**: Convert the solution (start time in minutes) back to the \"HH:MM\" format for output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef time_to_minutes(time_str):\n    parts = time_str.split(':')\n    hour = int(parts[0])\n    minute = int(parts[1])\n    return (hour - 9) * 60 + minute\n\nkayla_blocks = [\n    (\"10:00\", \"10:30\"),\n    (\"14:30\", \"16:00\")\n]\n\nrebecca_blocks = [\n    (\"9:00\", \"13:00\"),\n    (\"13:30\", \"15:00\"),\n    (\"15:30\", \"16:00\")\n]\n\nkayla_intervals = [(time_to_minutes(start), time_to_minutes(end)) for start, end in kayla_blocks]\nrebecca_intervals = [(time_to_minutes(start), time_to_minutes(end)) for start, end in rebecca_blocks]\n\nS = Int('S')\nsolver = Solver()\n\nsolver.add(S >= 0)\nsolver.add(S + 60 <= 480)\n\nfor (a, b) in kayla_intervals:\n    solver.add(Or(S + 60 <= a, S >= b))\n\nfor (a, b) in rebecca_intervals:\n    solver.add(Or(S + 60 <= a, S >= b))\n\nif solver.check() == sat:\n    model = solver.model()\n    start_minutes = model[S].as_long()\n    total_minutes = start_minutes\n    hours = total_minutes // 60\n    minutes = total_minutes % 60\n    start_time = f\"{9 + hours}:{minutes:02d}\"\n    end_minutes = start_minutes + 60\n    end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n    end_minutes_remainder = end_minutes % 60\n    end_time = f\"{end_hours}:{end_minutes_remainder:02d}\"\n    print(\"Day: Monday\")\n    print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n    print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The `time_to_minutes` function converts time strings (e.g., \"10:00\") into minutes elapsed since 9:00. For example, \"10:00\" becomes 60 minutes.\n2. **Blocked Intervals**: Each participant's blocked intervals are converted into tuples of start and end minutes. For instance, Kayla's block from 10:00 to 10:30 is stored as (60, 90).\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver is initialized with constraints:\n   - The meeting start time `S` must be between 0 (9:00) and 420 (16:00) minutes to ensure it ends by 17:00.\n   - For each blocked interval, the meeting must either end before the interval starts or start after the interval ends.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start time in minutes is converted back to \"HH:MM\" format. For example, 420 minutes becomes 16:00. The end time is calculated by adding 60 minutes to the start time.\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed in the specified format, showing the meeting day (Monday), start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the available time slots by leveraging constraint solving, ensuring the meeting fits within all participants' schedules and the given work hours."
