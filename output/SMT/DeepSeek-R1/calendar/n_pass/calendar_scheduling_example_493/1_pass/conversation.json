You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Tyler, Kelly, Stephanie, Hannah, Joe, Diana and Deborah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nTyler is free the entire day.\nKellyhas no meetings the whole day.\nStephanie has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nHannahhas no meetings the whole day.\nJoe has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 17:00; \nDiana has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nDeborah is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot that fits within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday for all participants: Tyler, Kelly, Stephanie, Hannah, Joe, Diana, and Deborah. The solution must avoid any time slots where any participant has a conflicting meeting.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent each time slot in minutes starting from 9:00 (0 minutes) to 17:00 (480 minutes). This simplifies the arithmetic for checking overlaps.\n2. **Define Constraints**: For each participant's busy intervals, ensure the meeting (start time to start time + 30 minutes) does not overlap. Specifically, the meeting must either end before the busy interval starts or start after the busy interval ends.\n3. **Use Z3 Solver**: Utilize the Z3 theorem prover to find a start time that satisfies all constraints. The solver checks possible start times (0 to 450 minutes, since the meeting must end by 17:00) against all constraints derived from participants' busy intervals.\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid start time is found, convert it back to HH:MM format and output the meeting details (day, start time, end time).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    s = Solver()\n    start = Int('start')\n    s.add(start >= 0)\n    s.add(start <= 450)  # Meeting must end by 17:00 (480 minutes)\n\n    # Busy intervals for each participant (in minutes from 9:00)\n    stephanie_busy = [(120, 150), (330, 360)]\n    joe_busy = [(0, 30), (60, 180), (210, 240), (300, 480)]\n    diana_busy = [(0, 90), (150, 180), (240, 300), (330, 390), (420, 480)]\n    deborah_busy = [(0, 60), (90, 180), (210, 240), (270, 300), (330, 390), (420, 450)]\n\n    # Combine all participants' busy intervals\n    all_busy = [stephanie_busy, joe_busy, diana_busy, deborah_busy]\n\n    for participant in all_busy:\n        for (a, b) in participant:\n            s.add(Or(start + 30 <= a, start >= b))\n\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_min = m[start].as_long()\n        hours = start_min // 60\n        minutes = start_min % 60\n        start_hour = 9 + hours\n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n        end_min = start_min + 30\n        end_hours = end_min // 60\n        end_minutes = end_min % 60\n        end_time = f\"{9 + end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n\n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Monday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The code converts the 9:00-17:00 workday into minutes (0 to 480) for easier arithmetic operations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**: For each participant's busy intervals, the code adds constraints to the solver ensuring the meeting does not overlap. The constraint is that the meeting must either end before the busy interval starts (`start + 30 <= a`) or start after the busy interval ends (`start >= b`).\n3. **Solver Execution**: The Z3 solver checks all possible start times (0 to 450 minutes) against the constraints. If a valid start time is found, it converts the start and end times back to HH:MM format.\n4. **Output**: The solution is printed in the specified format, showing the meeting day (Monday), start time, and end time.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to find a feasible meeting time that accommodates all participants' schedules. The Z3 solver ensures correctness by systematically checking all constraints and finding a valid solution if one exists."
