You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Betty and Megan for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBetty is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Friday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nMegan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30, Friday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nBetty can not meet on Wednesday. Thursday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a one-hour meeting slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on a weekday (Monday to Friday) that accommodates the busy schedules of both Betty and Megan. The solution involves analyzing their existing schedules and constraints to identify a suitable time slot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Betty cannot meet on Wednesday and Thursday, leaving Monday, Tuesday, and Friday as possible days.\n   - Megan is busy all day on Monday and Friday, so the only feasible day is Tuesday.\n   - On Tuesday, we convert both participants' busy intervals into minutes relative to 9:00 AM (e.g., 9:30 AM becomes 30 minutes).\n   - We need to find a 60-minute window within 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM (0 to 480 minutes) that does not overlap with any of their busy intervals.\n\n2. **Constraints Handling**:\n   - For each busy interval, ensure the meeting either ends before the interval starts or starts after the interval ends.\n   - The meeting must start after 9:00 AM and end by 5:00 PM.\n\n3. **Z3 Solver**:\n   - Use the Z3 theorem prover to model the start time (in minutes from 9:00 AM) as an integer variable.\n   - Add constraints based on the busy intervals of both participants.\n   - Solve for the start time and convert it back to HH:MM format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # We are only scheduling for Tuesday\n    t = Int('t')   # minutes from 9:00\n\n    s = Solver()\n\n    # Meeting must be within [0, 420] minutes (so that it ends by 480, which is 17:00)\n    s.add(t >= 0)\n    s.add(t <= 420)\n\n    # Betty's Tuesday intervals in minutes from 9:00 (start inclusive, end exclusive)\n    betty_tue = [(30, 60), (90, 120), (180, 210), (270, 360), (450, 480)]\n    for (start, end) in betty_tue:\n        s.add(Or(t + 60 <= start, t >= end))\n\n    # Megan's Tuesday intervals in minutes from 9:00\n    megan_tue = [(0, 30), (60, 90), (180, 300), (360, 390), (420, 450)]\n    for (start, end) in megan_tue:\n        s.add(Or(t + 60 <= start, t >= end))\n\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_minutes = m[t].as_long()\n        # Convert to time: 9:00 + start_minutes minutes\n        hours = start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        total_minutes = 9 * 60 + start_minutes\n        start_hour = total_minutes // 60\n        start_minute = total_minutes % 60\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + 60\n        total_end_minutes = 9 * 60 + end_minutes\n        end_hour = total_end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = total_end_minutes % 60\n        \n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        end_time = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(\"Day: Tuesday\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Day Selection**: \n   - Betty's unavailability on Wednesday and Thursday, combined with Megan's all-day commitments on Monday and Friday, leaves Tuesday as the only feasible day.\n\n2. **Time Conversion**:\n   - Busy intervals for both participants on Tuesday are converted into minutes relative to 9:00 AM. For example, 9:30 AM is 30 minutes, and 10:00 AM is 60 minutes.\n\n3. **Z3 Constraints**:\n   - The solver ensures the meeting does not overlap with any busy interval by requiring the meeting to either end before the interval starts or start after the interval ends.\n   - The meeting must fit within the 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM window, hence the start time `t` is constrained between 0 and 420 minutes (since the meeting duration is 60 minutes).\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - The solution is printed in the required format, specifying the day (Tuesday), start time, and end time in 24-hour format. For instance, a start time of 120 minutes from 9:00 AM converts to 11:00 AM.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible meeting times using logical constraints and leverages the Z3 solver to find a valid solution, ensuring all given constraints are satisfied."
