You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diane, Jack, Eugene and Patricia for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDiane has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nJack has blocked their calendar on Monday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nEugene has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30; \nPatricia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that accommodates all participants (Diane, Jack, Eugene, Patricia) without overlapping any of their blocked time intervals. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Translate all time intervals into minutes relative to 9:00 AM (e.g., 9:00 becomes 0, 10:00 becomes 60, etc.).\n2. **Define Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start and end within the working hours (0 to 480 minutes).\n   - The meeting duration is exactly 30 minutes.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any blocked intervals of any participant. For each blocked interval `[start, end]`, the meeting must either end before `start` or start after `end`.\n3. **Use Z3 Solver**: Utilize the Z3 theorem prover to find a feasible start time that satisfies all constraints. The solver checks all possible start times within the working hours against the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import Int, Solver, Or, And\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize the solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Define the start time in minutes from 9:00\n    S = Int('S')\n    \n    # Meeting duration in minutes\n    duration = 30\n    \n    # Total work day in minutes: 9:00 (0) to 17:00 (480)\n    work_start = 0\n    work_end = 480\n    \n    # Constraints: meeting must be within work hours\n    s.add(S >= work_start)\n    s.add(S + duration <= work_end)\n    \n    # Blocked intervals for each participant (in minutes from 9:00)\n    diane_blocked = [(30, 60), (330, 360)]\n    jack_blocked = [(270, 300), (330, 360)]\n    eugene_blocked = [(0, 60), (90, 150), (180, 330), (360, 450)]\n    patricia_blocked = [(30, 90), (120, 180), (150, 300), (360, 450)]\n    \n    # Function to add constraints for each participant's blocked intervals\n    def add_participant_constraints(intervals):\n        constraints = []\n        for start, end in intervals:\n            constraints.append(Or(S + duration <= start, S >= end))\n        s.add(And(constraints))\n    \n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    add_participant_constraints(diane_blocked)\n    add_participant_constraints(jack_blocked)\n    add_participant_constraints(eugene_blocked)\n    add_participant_constraints(patricia_blocked)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_minutes = model[S].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes back to time string\n        hours = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + duration\n        end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        print(f\"Monday {start_time} to {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: All time intervals are converted into minutes from 9:00 AM to simplify arithmetic operations.\n2. **Constraints Setup**:\n   - The meeting must start after 9:00 AM (0 minutes) and end before 5:00 PM (480 minutes).\n   - For each participant, the solver checks that the meeting does not overlap any of their blocked intervals. This is done by ensuring the meeting either ends before the start of a blocked interval or starts after the end of a blocked interval.\n3. **Z3 Solver**: The solver processes these constraints to find a feasible start time. If found, it converts the start time from minutes back to a readable format (HH:MM) and prints the meeting slot. If no solution exists, it outputs an appropriate message.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to find a suitable meeting time that respects all participants' schedules within the given workday."
