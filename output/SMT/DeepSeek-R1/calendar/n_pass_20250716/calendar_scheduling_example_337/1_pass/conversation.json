You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for John, Megan, Brandon, Kimberly, Sean and Lori for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJohn has meetings on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30; \nMegan has meetings on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nBrandonhas no meetings the whole day.\nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nSean has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nLori has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday that accommodates the busy schedules of all participants: John, Megan, Brandon, Kimberly, Sean, and Lori. The solution involves converting each participant's busy intervals into minutes relative to 9:00 AM, then using the Z3 solver to find a start time where none of the participants have overlapping meetings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Translate all meeting times into minutes starting from 9:00 AM (e.g., 9:00 AM is 0 minutes, 10:00 AM is 60 minutes).\n2. **Define Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start between 0 and 450 minutes (since 17:00 is 480 minutes, and the meeting lasts 30 minutes).\n   - For each participant, ensure the meeting does not overlap with any of their existing meetings. This means the meeting must either end before a busy interval starts or start after a busy interval ends.\n3. **Use Z3 Solver**: Utilize the Z3 theorem prover to find a valid start time that satisfies all constraints.\n4. **Convert Solution to Time**: Once a start time in minutes is found, convert it back to the HH:MM format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import Solver, Int, Or, And\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize Z3 solver and variable\n    s = Solver()\n    start_min = Int('start_min')\n\n    # Total available time: 9:00 (0 min) to 17:00 (480 min)\n    # Meeting duration: 30 minutes, so start must be between 0 and 450 minutes\n    s.add(start_min >= 0)\n    s.add(start_min <= 450)  # 480 - 30 = 450\n\n    # Define busy intervals in minutes for each participant (relative to 9:00)\n    john_busy = [(150, 180), (300, 330)]\n    megan_busy = [(180, 210), (300, 360), (390, 420)]\n    brandon_busy = []  # No meetings\n    kimberly_busy = [(0, 30), (60, 90), (120, 330), (360, 420), (450, 480)]\n    sean_busy = [(60, 120), (150, 300), (360, 390)]\n    lori_busy = [(0, 30), (90, 180), (240, 330), (420, 450)]\n\n    # Combine all participants' busy intervals\n    all_busy = [john_busy, megan_busy, brandon_busy, kimberly_busy, sean_busy, lori_busy]\n\n    # Add constraints for each participant\n    for participant in all_busy:\n        for (busy_start, busy_end) in participant:\n            # Ensure meeting does not overlap with busy interval\n            s.add(Or(\n                start_min + 30 <= busy_start,\n                start_min >= busy_end\n            ))\n\n    # Check if a solution exists\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_val = model[start_min].as_long()\n        # Convert minutes back to time string\n        total_minutes = start_val\n        hours = 9 + total_minutes // 60\n        minutes = total_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        end_minutes = total_minutes + 30\n        end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_min = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hours}:{end_min:02d}\"\n        print(f\"Monday {start_time} to {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: Each participant's busy intervals are converted into minutes relative to 9:00 AM. For example, 11:30 AM becomes 150 minutes (2.5 hours after 9:00 AM).\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting starts within the valid range (0 to 450 minutes). For each busy interval of every participant, it checks that the meeting either ends before the interval starts or starts after the interval ends.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: The solver finds a valid start time in minutes, which is then converted back to the HH:MM format. The start time and end time (start time + 30 minutes) are printed as the solution.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to find a feasible meeting time that accommodates all participants' schedules."
