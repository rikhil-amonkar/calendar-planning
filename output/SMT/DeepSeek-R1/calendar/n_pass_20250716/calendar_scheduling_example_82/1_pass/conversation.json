You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michael, Eric and Arthur for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMichael has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nEric's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nArthur has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot that fits within the working hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday for all participants (Michael, Eric, and Arthur) without overlapping with their existing meetings. Eric has no meetings, so only Michael and Arthur's schedules impose constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent all times in minutes from 9:00 AM (0 minutes) to 5:00 PM (480 minutes).\n2. **Define Constraints**:\n   - **Meeting Duration**: The meeting must last 30 minutes, so the start time must be between 0 and 450 minutes (inclusive).\n   - **Michael's Busy Slots**: \n     - 9:30-10:30 \u2192 30-90 minutes\n     - 15:00-15:30 \u2192 360-390 minutes\n     - 16:00-16:30 \u2192 420-450 minutes\n     - For each slot, ensure the meeting does not overlap (i.e., meeting ends before the slot starts or starts after the slot ends).\n   - **Arthur's Busy Slots**:\n     - 9:00-12:00 \u2192 0-180 minutes\n     - 13:00-15:00 \u2192 240-360 minutes\n     - 15:30-16:00 \u2192 390-420 minutes\n     - 16:30-17:00 \u2192 450-480 minutes\n     - Similarly, ensure no overlap with these slots.\n3. **Use Z3 Solver**: \n   - Create an integer variable for the meeting start time.\n   - Add constraints to avoid overlaps with all busy slots.\n   - Check for a feasible solution and convert the start time back to HH:MM format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Work day: 9:00 (0 minutes) to 17:00 (480 minutes)\n    start = Int('start')\n    meeting_duration = 30\n    \n    # Start time must be within [0, 450] to fit the meeting before 17:00\n    s.add(start >= 0)\n    s.add(start <= 450)\n    \n    # Michael's busy intervals (in minutes)\n    michael_busy = [(30, 90), (360, 390), (420, 450)]\n    # For each busy interval, ensure the meeting doesn't overlap\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in michael_busy:\n        s.add(Or(start + meeting_duration <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Arthur's busy intervals (in minutes)\n    arthur_busy = [(0, 180), (240, 360), (390, 420), (450, 480)]\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in arthur_busy:\n        s.add(Or(start + meeting_duration <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_minutes = model[start].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes to time string\n        hours = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        hours_end = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        minutes_end = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{hours_end:02d}:{minutes_end:02d}\"\n        \n        # Output the meeting time\n        print(f\"Monday {start_time} to {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The code converts all times into minutes relative to 9:00 AM (e.g., 9:30 AM becomes 30 minutes).\n2. **Constraints Setup**: \n   - The meeting must start between 0 and 450 minutes (inclusive) to ensure it ends by 5:00 PM.\n   - For each busy slot of Michael and Arthur, the solver adds constraints ensuring the meeting does not overlap (either ending before the slot starts or starting after the slot ends).\n3. **Solution Extraction**: \n   - The Z3 solver checks for a feasible start time. If found, it converts the start time from minutes back to HH:MM format.\n   - The meeting start and end times are printed in the required format (e.g., \"Monday 12:00 to 12:30\").\n\nThis approach efficiently finds a meeting slot that respects all given constraints using logical reasoning and constraint solving with Z3."
