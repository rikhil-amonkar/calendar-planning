You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Mary and Alexis for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMary has meetings on Tuesday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30; \nAlexis has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 10:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nYour output should be a string that starts with 'SOLUTION:' followed by three lines in this exact format:\nDay: <day>\nStart Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nEnd Time: <HH:MM> (24-hour format)\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find the earliest possible time slot for a 30-minute meeting between Mary and Alexis within their work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. The solution must avoid their existing busy times and prioritize the earliest available slot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Represent each time slot in minutes starting from 9:00 (i.e., 9:00 is 0 minutes, 10:00 is 60 minutes, etc.).\n2. **Define Busy Intervals**: For each participant, map their busy intervals for each day to minutes relative to 9:00.\n3. **Set Up Constraints**: Use the Z3 solver to define constraints ensuring the meeting:\n   - Fits within the workday (9:00 to 17:00), i.e., starts between 0 and 450 minutes (since 450 minutes from 9:00 is 16:30, allowing a 30-minute meeting to end by 17:00).\n   - Does not overlap with any busy interval of either participant on the chosen day.\n4. **Optimize for Earliest Slot**: Minimize a cost function combining the day and start time to find the earliest feasible meeting slot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Day mapping: 0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, 2=Wednesday, 3=Thursday\n    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday']\n    \n    # Busy intervals in minutes from 9:00 (start of the workday)\n    mary_busy = {\n        1: [(60, 90), (390, 420)],   # Tuesday: 10:00-10:30, 15:30-16:00\n        2: [(30, 60), (360, 390)],   # Wednesday: 9:30-10:00, 15:00-15:30\n        3: [(0, 60), (90, 150)]      # Thursday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30\n    }\n    \n    alexis_busy = {\n        0: [(0, 60), (90, 180), (210, 450)],   # Monday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-16:30\n        1: [(0, 60), (90, 150), (180, 390), (420, 480)],  # Tuesday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n        2: [(0, 120), (150, 480)],   # Wednesday: 9:00-11:00, 11:30-17:00\n        3: [(60, 180), (300, 330), (390, 420), (450, 480)]  # Thursday: 10:00-12:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n    }\n    \n    # Initialize Z3 variables\n    day_var = Int('day')\n    start_var = Int('start')\n    \n    # Initialize optimizer\n    opt = Optimize()\n    \n    # Day must be between 0 and 3 (Monday to Thursday)\n    opt.add(day_var >= 0, day_var <= 3)\n    # Start time must allow a 30-minute meeting within 9:00-17:00 (0 to 450 minutes)\n    opt.add(start_var >= 0, start_var <= 450)\n    \n    # Add constraints for Mary's busy intervals\n    for day, intervals in mary_busy.items():\n        for s, e in intervals:\n            # Meeting must not overlap: either ends before busy starts or starts after busy ends\n            opt.add(Implies(day_var == day, Or(start_var + 30 <= s, start_var >= e)))\n    \n    # Add constraints for Alexis's busy intervals\n    for day, intervals in alexis_busy.items():\n        for s, e in intervals:\n            opt.add(Implies(day_var == day, Or(start_var + 30 <= s, start_var >= e)))\n    \n    # Minimize: earlier day and then earlier start time\n    cost = day_var * 10000 + start_var\n    opt.minimize(cost)\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if opt.check() == sat:\n        model = opt.model()\n        d = model[day_var].as_long()\n        s = model[start_var].as_long()\n        \n        day_str = days[d]\n        total_minutes_start = s\n        start_hour = 9 + total_minutes_start // 60\n        start_minute = total_minutes_start % 60\n        end_minutes = total_minutes_start + 30\n        end_hour = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minute = end_minutes % 60\n        \n        start_time = f\"{start_hour:02d}:{start_minute:02d}\"\n        end_time = f\"{end_hour:02d}:{end_minute:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"SOLUTION:\")\n        print(f\"Day: {day_str}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: Time slots are converted into minutes from 9:00 to simplify arithmetic operations (e.g., 10:00 becomes 60 minutes).\n2. **Busy Intervals**: Each participant's busy intervals are mapped to their respective days using dictionaries, where keys are day indices (0-3) and values are lists of busy intervals in minutes.\n3. **Z3 Constraints**: The solver ensures the meeting:\n   - Starts within valid work hours (0 to 450 minutes from 9:00).\n   - Avoids all busy intervals for both participants on the selected day by either ending before a busy interval starts or starting after it ends.\n4. **Optimization**: The cost function `day * 10000 + start` prioritizes earlier days first, then earlier start times within those days.\n5. **Output**: The solution is formatted into the required day, start time, and end time, converting minutes back to 24-hour time format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the earliest feasible meeting slot while respecting all constraints using the Z3 solver's optimization capabilities."
