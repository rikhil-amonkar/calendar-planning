You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Eugene and Eric for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nEugene is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:30, Friday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30; \nEric is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 17:00, Friday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00; \n\nEric would like to avoid more meetings on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a suitable time slot for a 30-minute meeting between Eugene and Eric within their work hours (9:00 to 17:00) from Monday to Friday. The solution must respect their existing busy schedules and Eric's preference to avoid scheduling the meeting on Wednesday if possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find a 30-minute slot where both participants are free. The constraints include:\n   - Work hours are from 9:00 to 17:00.\n   - Each participant has specific busy intervals on certain days.\n   - Eric prefers not to have the meeting on Wednesday.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Represent time in minutes from 9:00 (0 minutes) to 17:00 (480 minutes). For each day, check the free intervals of both participants to find overlapping 30-minute slots. Prioritize days other than Wednesday to respect Eric's preference.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Use the Z3 solver to model the problem. Define integer variables for the day (0 to 4 representing Monday to Friday) and start time (0 to 450 minutes, ensuring the meeting ends by 17:00). Add constraints that the meeting must not overlap with any busy interval for either participant on the chosen day.\n\n4. **Optimization**: First, attempt to find a solution excluding Wednesday. If no solution is found, include Wednesday in the search.\n\n5. **Complexity**: The constraints involve checking against predefined busy intervals for each day. The Z3 solver efficiently handles these constraints without significant computational overhead for this problem size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    day = Int('day')\n    start = Int('start')\n    s = Solver()\n\n    s.add(day >= 0, day <= 4)\n    s.add(start >= 0, start <= 450)\n\n    eugene_busy = {\n        0: [(120, 180), (270, 300), (330, 360), (420, 450)],\n        1: [],\n        2: [(0, 30), (120, 150), (180, 210), (270, 360)],\n        3: [(30, 60), (120, 210)],\n        4: [(90, 120), (180, 210), (240, 270)]\n    }\n\n    eric_busy = {\n        0: [(0, 480)],\n        1: [(0, 480)],\n        2: [(0, 150), (180, 300), (330, 450)],\n        3: [(0, 480)],\n        4: [(0, 120), (150, 480)]\n    }\n\n    for d in range(5):\n        for interval in eugene_busy[d]:\n            b_start, b_end = interval\n            s.add(If(day == d, Or(start + 30 <= b_start, start >= b_end), True))\n        for interval in eric_busy[d]:\n            b_start, b_end = interval\n            s.add(If(day == d, Or(start + 30 <= b_start, start >= b_end), True))\n\n    s1 = Solver()\n    s1.add(s.assertions())\n    s1.add(day != 2)\n\n    if s1.check() == sat:\n        m = s1.model()\n        d_val = m[day].as_long()\n        start_val = m[start].as_long()\n    else:\n        s2 = Solver()\n        s2.add(s.assertions())\n        if s2.check() == sat:\n            m = s2.model()\n            d_val = m[day].as_long()\n            start_val = m[start].as_long()\n        else:\n            print(\"No solution found\")\n            return\n\n    days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n    day_str = days[d_val]\n    total_minutes = start_val\n    hours = 9 + total_minutes // 60\n    minutes = total_minutes % 60\n    start_time = f\"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}\"\n    end_minutes = start_val + 30\n    end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n    end_minutes %= 60\n    end_time = f\"{end_hours:02d}:{end_minutes:02d}\"\n\n    print(f\"Day: {day_str}, Start: {start_time}, End: {end_time}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Variables and Constraints**: \n   - `day` represents the meeting day (0 to 4 for Monday to Friday).\n   - `start` represents the meeting start time in minutes from 9:00 (0 to 450 minutes, ensuring the meeting ends by 17:00).\n   - Constraints ensure the meeting does not overlap with any busy interval for Eugene or Eric on the chosen day.\n\n2. **Busy Intervals**: \n   - Eugene's and Eric's busy intervals are predefined for each day in minutes from 9:00.\n   - For each day, constraints are added to ensure the meeting does not overlap with any busy interval.\n\n3. **Preference Handling**: \n   - First, solve with `day != 2` (avoid Wednesday). If a solution is found, use it.\n   - If no solution is found without Wednesday, solve again including Wednesday.\n\n4. **Output**: \n   - Convert the solution (day and start time) to readable format (day name, start time, and end time in HH:MM format).\n\nThis approach efficiently finds a suitable meeting time while respecting all constraints and preferences using the Z3 solver."
