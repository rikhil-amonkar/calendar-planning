Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a one-hour meeting slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that accommodates the busy schedules of James and John. The solution involves converting time intervals into minutes past 9:00, defining constraints to avoid busy periods, and using the Z3 solver to find a valid meeting start time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: All time intervals are converted into minutes relative to 9:00 AM (e.g., 9:00 is 0 minutes, 17:00 is 480 minutes).\n2. **Define Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start between 0 and 420 minutes (inclusive) to ensure it ends by 17:00.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any busy intervals of James or John. For each busy interval `[start, end)`, the meeting must either end before `start` or start after `end`.\n3. **Use Z3 Solver**: The Z3 solver is employed to find a start time `S` (in minutes) that satisfies all constraints. The constraints are derived from the busy intervals of both participants.\n4. **Convert Back to Time**: Once a valid start time `S` is found, it is converted back to the format \"HH:MM\" for the start and end times of the meeting.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import Solver, Int, Or, sat\n\ndef main():\n    s = Solver()\n    # Start time in minutes after 9:00\n    S = Int('S')\n    \n    # Meeting must be within 9:00 (0 min) to 17:00 (480 min), duration 60 min -> S in [0, 420]\n    s.add(S >= 0)\n    s.add(S <= 420)\n    \n    # James' busy intervals in minutes (exclusive end)\n    # 11:30-12:00 -> [150, 180)\n    # 14:30-15:00 -> [330, 360)\n    s.add(Or(S + 60 <= 150, S >= 180))\n    s.add(Or(S + 60 <= 330, S >= 360))\n    \n    # John's busy intervals in minutes (exclusive end)\n    # 9:30-11:00 -> [30, 120)\n    # 11:30-12:00 -> [150, 180)\n    # 12:30-13:30 -> [210, 270)\n    # 14:30-16:30 -> [330, 450)\n    s.add(Or(S + 60 <= 30, S >= 120))\n    s.add(Or(S + 60 <= 150, S >= 180))\n    s.add(Or(S + 60 <= 210, S >= 270))\n    s.add(Or(S + 60 <= 330, S >= 450))\n    \n    # Check for a solution\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        start_minutes = model[S].as_long()\n        \n        # Convert start_minutes to hours and minutes\n        hours = start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{9 + hours}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        # Calculate end time (start + 60 minutes)\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + 60\n        end_hours = end_minutes // 60\n        end_min = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{9 + end_hours}:{end_min:02d}\"\n        \n        print(\"Monday\", start_time, end_time)\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Time Conversion**: The code converts all time points into minutes past 9:00 AM. For example, 11:30 becomes 150 minutes (2.5 hours * 60 minutes).\n2. **Constraints Setup**: The solver ensures the meeting:\n   - Starts between 0 and 420 minutes (inclusive) to fit within the 9:00-17:00 window.\n   - Avoids all busy intervals for James and John by either ending before the interval starts or starting after the interval ends.\n3. **Z3 Solver**: The solver checks for a feasible start time `S` that meets all constraints. If found, it converts `S` back to \"HH:MM\" format.\n4. **Output**: The solution prints the meeting day (Monday) and the start and end times in \"HH:MM\" format. For instance, a start time of 270 minutes (4.5 hours after 9:00) results in \"13:30\" to \"14:30\".\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages constraint solving to find a mutually available meeting slot, ensuring all given schedules and preferences are respected."
