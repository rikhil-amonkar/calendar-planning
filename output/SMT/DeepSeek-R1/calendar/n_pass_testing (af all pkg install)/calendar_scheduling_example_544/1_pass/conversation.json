You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Deborah and Albert for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDeborah is free the entire day.\nAlbert has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 15:00 to 16:30; \n\nAlbert can not meet on Monday after 11:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \nYour solution should always have three things: the day to meet, the start time, and the end time.\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver. Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a 30-minute meeting slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 that accommodates both Deborah and Albert's constraints. Deborah has no busy slots, but Albert has specific busy times and an additional constraint that he cannot meet after 11:00. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The meeting must be scheduled within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday, lasting exactly 30 minutes. Albert's busy intervals are:\n   - 9:00 to 10:00\n   - 10:30 to 12:00\n   - 15:00 to 16:30\nAdditionally, Albert cannot meet after 11:00, meaning the meeting must end by 11:00.\n\n2. **Time Conversion**: Convert all times into minutes relative to 9:00 (e.g., 9:00 becomes 0 minutes, 10:00 becomes 60 minutes, 11:00 becomes 120 minutes, etc.).\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start at or after 0 minutes (9:00).\n   - The meeting must end by 120 minutes (11:00), so `start + 30 \u2264 120`.\n   - The meeting must not overlap with any of Albert's busy intervals. For each interval `[b_start, b_end)`, ensure the meeting either ends before `b_start` or starts after `b_end`.\n\n4. **Solver Setup**: Use the Z3 solver to find a start time that satisfies all constraints. Convert the solution back to a readable time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    day = \"Monday\"\n    work_start = 0  # 9:00 in minutes\n    work_end = 480  # 17:00 in minutes (8 hours * 60 minutes)\n    meeting_duration = 30  # minutes\n\n    s = Solver()\n    start = Int('start')\n\n    # Constraint: Meeting must be within work hours\n    s.add(start >= work_start)\n    s.add(start + meeting_duration <= work_end)\n\n    # Albert cannot meet after 11:00 (120 minutes from 9:00)\n    s.add(start + meeting_duration <= 120)\n\n    # Albert's busy intervals (in minutes from 9:00)\n    albert_busy = [\n        (0, 60),    # 9:00-10:00\n        (90, 180),  # 10:30-12:00\n        (360, 450)   # 15:00-16:30\n    ]\n\n    # Ensure no overlap with Albert's busy intervals\n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in albert_busy:\n        s.add(Or(start + meeting_duration <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n\n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_minutes = m.eval(start).as_long()\n\n        # Convert start_minutes back to time string\n        hours = 9 + start_minutes // 60\n        minutes = start_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\n        # Calculate end time\n        end_minutes = start_minutes + meeting_duration\n        end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes_remainder = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hours}:{end_minutes_remainder:02d}\"\n\n        print(f\"Day: {day}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The solver is initialized with the meeting day (\"Monday\"), work hours (9:00 to 17:00 converted to 0 to 480 minutes), and meeting duration (30 minutes).\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting must start within work hours (`start \u2265 0` and `start + 30 \u2264 480`).\n   - Albert cannot meet after 11:00, so the meeting must end by 120 minutes (`start + 30 \u2264 120`).\n   - The meeting must not overlap with Albert's busy intervals. For each interval, the meeting must either end before the interval starts or start after the interval ends.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start time in minutes is converted back to a readable format (e.g., 60 minutes becomes 10:00). The end time is calculated by adding 30 minutes to the start time.\n4. **Output**: The solution is printed as the day, start time, and end time. The only feasible slot meeting all constraints is 10:00 to 10:30."
