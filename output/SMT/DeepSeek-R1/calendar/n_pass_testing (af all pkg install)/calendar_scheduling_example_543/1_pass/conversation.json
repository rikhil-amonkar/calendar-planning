Always surround your final code with ```python\nYOUR_CODE\n```.\n"

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to find a one-hour meeting slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that fits within the busy schedules of both James and John. The solution involves modeling the participants' busy intervals and using constraint programming to find a suitable meeting time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The meeting must last exactly 60 minutes and must occur within the working hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. Each participant has specific busy intervals during this period. The goal is to find a time slot where neither participant has any overlapping commitments.\n\n2. **Modeling Time**: Convert time into minutes starting from 9:00 (i.e., 9:00 is 0 minutes, 10:00 is 60 minutes, etc.). The working day spans from 0 to 480 minutes (9:00 to 17:00).\n\n3. **Busy Intervals**: Represent each participant's busy intervals as half-open intervals `[start, end)`, meaning the participant is busy from `start` inclusive to `end` exclusive. \n   - James' busy intervals: [150, 180) and [330, 360)\n   - John's busy intervals: [30, 120), [150, 180), [210, 270), and [330, 450)\n\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - The meeting start time must be within working hours (0 \u2264 start \u2264 420 minutes, since 480 - 60 = 420).\n   - The meeting interval `[start, start + 60)` must not overlap with any of James' or John's busy intervals. This means either:\n     - The meeting ends before a busy interval starts (`start + 60 \u2264 busy_start`), or\n     - The meeting starts after the busy interval ends (`start \u2265 busy_end`).\n\n5. **Solver Setup**: Use the Z3 solver to find a start time that satisfies all constraints. Convert the solution back to a readable time format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    day = \"Monday\"\n    work_start_minutes = 0\n    work_end_minutes = 480\n    meeting_duration = 60\n    \n    s = Solver()\n    start = Int('start')\n    \n    s.add(start >= work_start_minutes)\n    s.add(start + meeting_duration <= work_end_minutes)\n    \n    james_busy = [(150, 180), (330, 360)]\n    john_busy = [(30, 120), (150, 180), (210, 270), (330, 450)]\n    \n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in james_busy:\n        s.add(Or(start + meeting_duration <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n    \n    for (busy_start, busy_end) in john_busy:\n        s.add(Or(start + meeting_duration <= busy_start, start >= busy_end))\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        start_val = m.eval(start).as_long()\n        \n        total_minutes = start_val\n        hours = 9 + total_minutes // 60\n        minutes = total_minutes % 60\n        start_time = f\"{hours}:{minutes:02d}\"\n        \n        end_minutes = start_val + meeting_duration\n        end_hours = 9 + end_minutes // 60\n        end_minutes_remainder = end_minutes % 60\n        end_time = f\"{end_hours}:{end_minutes_remainder:02d}\"\n        \n        print(f\"Day: {day}\")\n        print(f\"Start Time: {start_time}\")\n        print(f\"End Time: {end_time}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The working day is set from 0 to 480 minutes (9:00 to 17:00), and the meeting duration is 60 minutes.\n2. **Solver Setup**: The Z3 solver is initialized with an integer variable `start` representing the meeting start time in minutes from 9:00.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The start time must be within working hours (0 to 420 minutes).\n   - For each busy interval of James and John, the solver ensures the meeting does not overlap by either ending before the busy interval starts or starting after it ends.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the start time is converted back to hours and minutes. For example, 270 minutes becomes 13:30 (since 270 minutes = 4 hours 30 minutes after 9:00). The end time is 60 minutes later (14:30).\n5. **Output**: The solution is printed as the day (Monday), start time (13:30), and end time (14:30).\n\nThis approach efficiently models the scheduling constraints using Z3's constraint-solving capabilities to find a feasible meeting time that accommodates both participants' busy schedules."
