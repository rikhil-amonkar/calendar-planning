        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 12-day itinerary for visiting three European cities (Vilnius, Munich, and Mykonos) using direct flights between them. The constraints are:\n- Spend 4 days in Vilnius.\n- Spend 3 days in Munich.\n- Spend 7 days in Mykonos.\n- Direct flights are available from Vilnius to Munich and between Munich and Mykonos.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each flight day counts as a day in both the departure and arrival cities. The total days spent in all cities is the sum of days in each city minus the flight days. Given the days required (4 + 3 + 7 = 14), and the total trip days (12), there must be 2 flight days (since 14 - 12 = 2).\n\n2. **Flight Constraints**: The available flights are:\n   - Vilnius to Munich (unidirectional).\n   - Munich to Mykonos (bidirectional).\n   The only feasible route is Vilnius \u2192 Munich \u2192 Mykonos because there's no return flight from Munich to Vilnius.\n\n3. **Day Calculation**:\n   - **Vilnius**: Days 1 to 4 (4 days, with Day 4 as the flight day to Munich).\n   - **Munich**: Days 4 to 6 (3 days: Day 4 in both Vilnius and Munich, Days 5 and 6 in Munich, with Day 6 as the flight day to Mykonos).\n   - **Mykonos**: Days 6 to 12 (7 days: Day 6 in both Munich and Mykonos, Days 7 to 12 in Mykonos).\n\n4. **Itinerary Construction**: For each city, include:\n   - A continuous range of days spent in the city (including flight days).\n   - Separate entries for flight days to indicate presence in both departure and arrival cities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import Int, Solver, sat\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    F1 = Int('F1')\n    F2 = Int('F2')\n    s = Solver()\n    s.add(F1 >= 1, F1 <= 12)\n    s.add(F2 >= 1, F2 <= 12)\n    s.add(F1 < F2)\n    s.add(F1 == 4)\n    s.add(F2 - F1 + 1 == 3)\n    s.add(12 - F2 + 1 == 7)\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        f1 = m[F1].as_long()\n        f2 = m[F2].as_long()\n        \n        itinerary = []\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day 1-{f1}\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"})\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {f1}\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"})\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {f1}\", \"place\": \"Munich\"})\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {f1}-{f2}\", \"place\": \"Munich\"})\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {f2}\", \"place\": \"Munich\"})\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {f2}\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"})\n        itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {f2}-12\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"})\n        \n        result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary}\n        print(json.dumps(result))\n    else:\n        print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No solution found\"}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver determines the flight days (F1 and F2) constrained by:\n   - F1 must be between 1 and 12 (day of flight from Vilnius to Munich).\n   - F2 must be between 1 and 12 (day of flight from Munich to Mykonos).\n   - F1 must occur before F2.\n   - Days in Vilnius = F1 = 4.\n   - Days in Munich = F2 - F1 + 1 = 3.\n   - Days in Mykonos = 12 - F2 + 1 = 7.\n\n2. **Itinerary Construction**:\n   - **Vilnius**: Continuous stay from Day 1 to F1 (Day 4), with a separate entry for the flight day (Day 4).\n   - **Munich**: Continuous stay from Day F1 (4) to F2 (6), with separate entries for the flight day (Day 6).\n   - **Mykonos**: Continuous stay from Day F2 (6) to Day 12, with a separate entry for the flight day (Day 6).\n\n3. **Output**: The itinerary is printed as a JSON-formatted dictionary with entries for each continuous stay and flight day, ensuring flight days are listed for both departure and arrival cities. The solution efficiently meets all constraints using the Z3 solver to validate the flight days."
