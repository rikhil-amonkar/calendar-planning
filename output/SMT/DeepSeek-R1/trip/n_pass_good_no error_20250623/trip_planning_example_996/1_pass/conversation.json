        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 22-day itinerary for visiting 7 European cities, ensuring that the traveler spends the required number of days in each city and adheres to specific time constraints for certain cities. The solution must also account for direct flights between cities, and on flight days, the traveler is considered to be in both the departure and arrival cities.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling visits to 7 cities over 22 days with specific day requirements for each city. The traveler must attend a wedding in Mykonos between days 1-3 and visit relatives in Prague between days 7-9. Direct flights between certain cities are given, and the itinerary must use only these direct flights for commuting.\n2. **Key Insights**: \n   - The total days spent in cities (28) exceeds the trip duration (22) because flight days count towards both the departure and arrival cities. With 7 cities, there will be 6 flights, adding 6 extra days (22 + 6 = 28).\n   - The itinerary can be modeled as a sequence of contiguous stays in each city, with flights connecting consecutive cities. Each segment (city stay) has a start and end day, and consecutive segments share a flight day.\n3. **Constraints Handling**:\n   - **Mykonos Constraint**: The stay in Mykonos must start by day 3 to cover the wedding days (1-3).\n   - **Prague Constraint**: The stay in Prague must overlap with days 7-9, meaning its start day must be \u22649 and end day \u22657.\n   - **Flight Constraints**: Consecutive cities in the sequence must have a direct flight.\n4. **Algorithm Selection**: We use the Z3 solver to model the problem as a permutation of cities with constraints on flight connections and day requirements. The solver finds a valid sequence of cities and their respective stay periods.\n5. **Output Generation**: The itinerary is constructed by:\n   - Listing contiguous stays for each city.\n   - Adding separate entries for flight days, indicating presence in both departure and arrival cities on the same day.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    cities = ['Mykonos', 'Nice', 'Prague', 'Bucharest', 'Zurich', 'Valencia', 'Riga']\n    days_list = [3, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n    city_to_index = {city: idx for idx, city in enumerate(cities)}\n    \n    edges = [\n        ('Mykonos', 'Nice'), ('Mykonos', 'Zurich'),\n        ('Prague', 'Bucharest'), ('Valencia', 'Bucharest'),\n        ('Zurich', 'Prague'), ('Riga', 'Nice'),\n        ('Zurich', 'Riga'), ('Zurich', 'Bucharest'),\n        ('Zurich', 'Valencia'), ('Bucharest', 'Riga'),\n        ('Prague', 'Riga'), ('Prague', 'Valencia'),\n        ('Zurich', 'Nice')\n    ]\n    directed_edges = []\n    for a, b in edges:\n        idx_a = city_to_index[a]\n        idx_b = city_to_index[b]\n        directed_edges.append((idx_a, idx_b))\n        directed_edges.append((idx_b, idx_a))\n    \n    c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7 = Ints('c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7')\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    for ci in [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7]:\n        s.add(ci >= 0, ci < 7)\n    s.add(Distinct(c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7))\n    \n    for i in range(6):\n        curr = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7][i]\n        nxt = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7][i+1]\n        s.add(Or([And(curr == a, nxt == b) for (a, b) in directed_edges]))\n    \n    def day_func(c):\n        return If(c == 0, 3,\n              If(c == 1, 2,\n              If(c == 2, 3,\n              If(c == 3, 5,\n              If(c == 4, 5,\n              If(c == 5, 5, 5))))))\n    \n    d1 = day_func(c1)\n    d2 = day_func(c2)\n    d3 = day_func(c3)\n    d4 = day_func(c4)\n    d5 = day_func(c5)\n    d6 = day_func(c6)\n    d7 = day_func(c7)\n    \n    S0 = 0\n    S1 = Int('S1')\n    S2 = Int('S2')\n    S3 = Int('S3')\n    S4 = Int('S4')\n    S5 = Int('S5')\n    S6 = Int('S6')\n    S7 = Int('S7')\n    s.add(S1 == S0 + d1)\n    s.add(S2 == S1 + d2)\n    s.add(S3 == S2 + d3)\n    s.add(S4 == S3 + d4)\n    s.add(S5 == S4 + d5)\n    s.add(S6 == S5 + d6)\n    s.add(S7 == S6 + d7)\n    \n    S = [S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7]\n    positions = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7]\n    \n    mykonos_index = city_to_index['Mykonos']\n    prague_index = city_to_index['Prague']\n    \n    for j in range(7):\n        s.add(Implies(positions[j] == mykonos_index, S[j] - j <= 2))\n    \n    for j in range(7):\n        s.add(Implies(positions[j] == prague_index, \n                      And(S[j] - j >= 4, S[j] - j <= 8)))\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        order = [m.evaluate(c1), m.evaluate(c2), m.evaluate(c3), \n                 m.evaluate(c4), m.evaluate(c5), m.evaluate(c6), m.evaluate(c7)]\n        city_names = []\n        for idx in order:\n            city_names.append(cities[idx.as_long()])\n        \n        cum = 0\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(7):\n            city_idx = order[i].as_long()\n            d = days_list[city_idx]\n            start_day = 1 + cum - i\n            end_day = start_day + d - 1\n            segments.append((start_day, end_day, cities[city_idx]))\n            cum += d\n        \n        itinerary = []\n        for i in range(len(segments)):\n            start, end, city = segments[i]\n            itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {start}-{end}\", \"place\": city})\n            if i < len(segments) - 1:\n                itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {end}\", \"place\": city})\n                next_city = segments[i+1][2]\n                itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {end}\", \"place\": next_city})\n        \n        result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary}\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **City and Flight Setup**: The cities and their required stay durations are defined. Direct flight connections are converted into directed edges for flexibility.\n2. **Z3 Variables and Constraints**: \n   - Seven integer variables represent the sequence of cities.\n   - Constraints ensure each city is visited exactly once and consecutive cities have direct flights.\n   - Cumulative sums of days are tracked to compute start and end days for each city segment.\n3. **Special Constraints**:\n   - **Mykonos**: The stay must start by day 3.\n   - **Prague**: The stay must overlap with days 7-9.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: \n   - The solver finds a valid city sequence and stay periods.\n   - The itinerary is built by listing contiguous stays and adding separate entries for flight days.\n5. **Output**: The result is a JSON-formatted itinerary with contiguous stays and flight day records. \n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem using constraint solving to ensure all requirements are met, providing a valid and optimized travel itinerary."
