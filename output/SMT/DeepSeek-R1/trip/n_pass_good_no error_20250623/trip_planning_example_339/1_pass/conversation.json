        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 17-day itinerary for visiting four European cities (Warsaw, Budapest, Paris, and Riga) while adhering to specific constraints on the number of days spent in each city and ensuring direct flights are used for commuting between cities. The constraints include attending events on specific days and ensuring the wedding in Riga is attended between days 11 and 17.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling visits to four cities over 17 days with specific day constraints:\n   - 7 days in Riga, with at least one day between days 11 and 17.\n   - 7 days in Budapest.\n   - 4 days in Paris.\n   - 2 days in Warsaw, with days 1 and 2 fixed in Warsaw for an annual show.\n   - Direct flights are available between specific city pairs: Warsaw-Budapest, Warsaw-Riga, Warsaw-Paris, Budapest-Paris, and Paris-Riga.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: \n   - Each flight day counts as a day in both the departure and arrival cities, contributing to the total days in each city.\n   - The total \"city-days\" (sum of days spent in all cities) is 20 (7+7+4+2), but there are only 17 calendar days. This implies there are 3 flight days (since each flight day adds an extra day by being counted in two cities).\n\n3. **Modeling the Itinerary**:\n   - The itinerary starts in Warsaw for days 1 and 2.\n   - Flights occur on specific days, and the sequence of cities must respect direct flight availability.\n   - Using the Z3 solver, we model the cities visited, the start and end days of each stay, and ensure constraints on days per city and flight connections are satisfied.\n\n4. **Constraints Handling**:\n   - **City Days**: Ensure the total days spent in each city meet the specified requirements.\n   - **Flight Connections**: Consecutive cities must have direct flights.\n   - **Wedding Constraint**: Ensure Riga is visited between days 11 and 17.\n   - **Sequence**: The itinerary is divided into four stays (including the initial stay in Warsaw), connected by three flights.\n\n5. **Solution Extraction**: \n   - Once Z3 finds a valid model, the itinerary is constructed by formatting the stay ranges and flight days as specified.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    # Create solver\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    # Variables for the cities of the three stays after Warsaw\n    s1 = Int('s1')\n    s2 = Int('s2')\n    s3 = Int('s3')\n    \n    # Variables for the end days of the second and third stays\n    a = Int('a')  # end day of stay1 (which starts at day2)\n    b = Int('b')  # end day of stay2 (which starts at day a)\n    \n    # Constraints for s1, s2, s3: each is one of 1,2,3 (Budapest, Paris, Riga) and they are distinct\n    s.add(s1 >= 1, s1 <= 3)\n    s.add(s2 >= 1, s2 <= 3)\n    s.add(s3 >= 1, s3 <= 3)\n    s.add(Distinct(s1, s2, s3))\n    \n    # Constraints for a and b: a is at least 2, b is at least a, and both at most 17\n    s.add(a >= 2, a <= 17)\n    s.add(b >= a, b <= 17)\n    \n    # Days in each city (city0: Warsaw, city1: Budapest, city2: Paris, city3: Riga)\n    # Warsaw: stay0: days 1 to 2 -> 2 days (fixed)\n    # For the other cities: sum over the stays\n    days_city1 = If(s1 == 1, a -

The cities `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` must be distinct and within the set {1 (Budapest), 2 (Paris), 3 (Riga)}.\n   - The end days `a` and `b` must adhere to the sequence: `2 \u2264 a \u2264 17`, `a \u2264 b \u2264 17`.\n   - The total days spent in each city must satisfy the given constraints (7 in Budapest, 4 in Paris, 7 in Riga).\n   - The wedding in Riga must be attended between days 11 and 17, ensured by checking if Riga is in one of the stays overlapping this period.\n   - Direct flights must exist between consecutive cities in the itinerary.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the itinerary is constructed by formatting the stay ranges and flight days. The output is a JSON object with the itinerary as a list of day-place mappings, including separate entries for flight days to denote both departure and arrival cities.\n4. **Output**: The resulting itinerary is printed in the specified JSON format, detailing the continuous stays and flight days for each city."
