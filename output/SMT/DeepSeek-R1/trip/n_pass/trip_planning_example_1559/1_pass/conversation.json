        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 25-day itinerary for visiting 10 European cities with specific constraints on the duration of stays in each city, meeting friends on certain days, and ensuring that all flights between cities are direct. The solution involves constructing a sequence of city visits that adheres to all constraints and flight availability.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting 10 cities over 25 days with specific stay durations. Key constraints include:\n   - Fixed stays in Seville (days 5-9) and Mykonos (days 21-25).\n   - Meeting friends in Valencia (between days 3-4) and Oslo (between days 13-15).\n   - Direct flights between cities as specified.\n   - Each flight day counts as a day in both the departure and arrival cities.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - The itinerary must start on day 1 and end on day 25.\n   - Seville and Mykonos have fixed dates, so the remaining cities must be scheduled around these intervals.\n   - Flight days are shared between cities, reducing the total calendar days required.\n   - The last city before Mykonos must be Nice (since only Nice has a direct flight to Mykonos).\n\n3. **Solution Strategy**:\n   - **Segment Planning**: Divide the trip into segments:\n     - **Segment 1 (Days 1-5)**: Cities before Seville.\n     - **Segment 2 (Days 9-21)**: Cities between Seville and Mykonos.\n     - **Fixed Stays**: Seville (days 5-9) and Mykonos (days 21-25).\n   - **City Assignment**:\n     - Segment 1 includes Tallinn, Prague, and Valencia to meet the Valencia meeting constraint.\n     - Segment 2 includes Paris, Lyon, Oslo, Lisbon, and Nice to meet the Oslo meeting constraint and ensure Nice is the last city before Mykonos.\n   - **Flight Connections**: Ensure all consecutive cities have direct flights.\n\n4. **Itinerary Construction**:\n   - For each city, record the continuous stay range.\n   - For flight days, record the departure from the current city and arrival in the next city on the same day.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport json\n\nitinerary = [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Tallinn\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2\", \"place\": \"Tallinn\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-4\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-5\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5\", \"place\": \"Seville\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Seville\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9\", \"place\": \"Seville\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-12\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-15\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-17\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17\", \"place\": \"Lisbon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-18\", \"place\": \"Lisbon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 18\", \"place\": \"Lisbon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 18\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 18-21\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21-25\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"}\n]\n\nresult = {\"itinerary\": itinerary}\nprint(json.dumps(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Itinerary Structure**:\n   - The itinerary is structured as a list of dictionaries, each specifying a day range and the corresponding city.\n   - For continuous stays (e.g., Tallinn from day 1 to 2), a single entry covers the entire duration.\n   - Flight days (e.g., day 2 from Tallinn to Prague) include separate entries for departure and arrival.\n\n2. **Segment Handling**:\n   - **Segment 1 (Days 1-5)**: Tallinn (days 1-2), Prague (days 2-4), and Valencia (days 4-5). Ensures the meeting in Valencia on day 4.\n   - **Fixed Stay in Seville (Days 5-9)**: Direct flight from Valencia to Seville on day 5.\n   - **Segment 2 (Days 9-21)**: Paris (days 9-12), Lyon (days 12-15), Oslo (days 15-17), Lisbon (days 17-18), and Nice (days 18-21). Ensures the meeting in Oslo on day 15.\n   - **Fixed Stay in Mykonos (Days 21-25)**: Direct flight from Nice to Mykonos on day 21.\n\n3. **Flight Connections**:\n   - All consecutive cities have direct flights as per the problem's flight list (e.g., Tallinn to Prague, Prague to Valencia, Lisbon to Nice, Nice to Mykonos).\n\nThis solution efficiently schedules the trip, meeting all constraints and ensuring minimal overlap of flight days with city stays. The JSON output provides a clear and structured itinerary for the 25-day trip."
