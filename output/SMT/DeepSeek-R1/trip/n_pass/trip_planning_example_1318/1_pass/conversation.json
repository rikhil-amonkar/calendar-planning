        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 25-day itinerary for visiting 9 European cities, ensuring that each city is visited for a specified number of consecutive days, and that direct flights are available between consecutive cities in the itinerary. Additionally, certain cities have specific constraints on the days they must be visited.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling visits to 9 cities over 25 days with specific duration constraints for each city. The key constraints are:\n   - Each city must be visited for a consecutive block of days.\n   - Direct flights must exist between consecutive cities in the itinerary.\n   - Oslo must be visited on day 23 or 24 (to meet the friend between days 24 and 25).\n   - Tallinn must start by day 8 (to attend the wedding between days 4 and 8).\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and direct flights as a directed graph where nodes are cities and edges represent direct flights (both directions where applicable).\n\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**: Use the Z3 solver to find a valid sequence of cities:\n   - **Order Variables**: Define integer variables for the sequence of cities.\n   - **Distinct Constraint**: Ensure each city appears exactly once in the sequence.\n   - **Flight Constraints**: Ensure consecutive cities in the sequence have a direct flight.\n   - **Event Constraints**: Ensure Oslo starts on day 23 or 24, and Tallinn starts by day 8.\n\n4. **Position and Start Day Calculation**: For Oslo and Tallinn, compute their positions in the sequence and their start days based on the durations of preceding cities.\n\n5. **Solution Extraction**: After finding a valid sequence, compute the start and end days for each city in the itinerary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    s = Solver()\n    \n    cities = [\"Oslo\", \"Helsinki\", \"Edinburgh\", \"Riga\", \"Tallinn\", \"Budapest\", \"Vilnius\", \"Porto\", \"Geneva\"]\n    durations = [2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4]\n    \n    graph = [[False] * 9 for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    def add_edge(u, v):\n        graph[u][v] = True\n    \n    add_edge(7, 0); add_edge(0, 7)\n    add_edge(2, 5); add_edge(5, 2)\n    add_edge(2, 8); add_edge(8, 2)\n    add_edge(3, 4)\n    add_edge(2, 7); add_edge(7, 2)\n    add_edge(6, 1); add_edge(1, 6)\n    add_edge(4, 6)\n    add_edge(3, 0); add_edge(0, 3)\n    add_edge(8, 0); add_edge(0, 8)\n    add_edge(2, 0); add_edge(0, 2)\n    add_edge(2, 1); add_edge(1, 2)\n    add_edge(6, 0); add_edge(0, 6)\n    add_edge(3, 1); add_edge(1, 3)\n    add_edge(5, 8); add_edge(8, 5)\n    add_edge(1, 5); add_edge(5, 1)\n    add_edge(1, 0); add_edge(0, 1)\n    add_edge(2, 3); add_edge(3, 2)\n    add_edge(4, 1); add_edge(1, 4)\n    add_edge(8, 7); add_edge(7, 8)\n    add_edge(5, 0); add_edge(0, 5)\n    add_edge(1, 8); add_edge(8, 1)\n    add_edge(3, 6)\n    add_edge(4, 0); add_edge(0, 4)\n    \n    order = [Int(f'order_{i}') for i in range(9)]\n    for i in range(9):\n        s.add(order[i] >= 0, order[i] < 9)\n    s.add(Distinct(order))\n    \n    for i in range(8):\n        edge_exists = False\n        conditions = []\n        for u in range(9):\n            for v in range(9):\n                if graph[u][v]:\n                    conditions.append(And(order[i] == u, order[i+1] == v))\n        s.add(Or(conditions))\n    \n    dur_arr = Array('dur_arr', IntSort(), IntSort())\n    for idx in range(9):\n        s.add(dur_arr[idx] == durations[idx])\n    \n    pos0 = Int('pos0')\n    s.add(Or([And(order[j] == 0, pos0 == j) for j in range(9)]))\n    start0 = 1 + Sum([If(j < pos0, dur_arr[order[j]] - 1, 0) for j in range(9)])\n    s.add(Or(start0 == 23, start0 == 24))\n    \n    pos4 = Int('pos4')\n    s.add(Or([And(order[j] == 4, pos4 == j) for j in range(9)]))\n    start4 = 1 + Sum([If(j < pos4, dur_arr[order[j]] - 1, 0) for j in range(9)])\n    s.add(start4 <= 8)\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        ord_val = [m.evaluate(order[i]).as_long() for i in range(9)]\n        current_start = 1\n        for i in range(9):\n            city_idx = ord_val[i]\n            dur = durations[city_idx]\n            end_day = current_start + dur - 1\n            print(f\"City: {cities[city_idx]}, Start day: {current_start}, End day: {end_day}\")\n            current_start = end_day\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Construction**: The directed graph is built based on the given direct flight information. Each edge represents a direct flight from one city to another.\n2. **Z3 Variables and Constraints**: \n   - `order` variables represent the sequence of cities.\n   - `Distinct` ensures each city is visited exactly once.\n   - Flight constraints ensure consecutive cities in the sequence have a direct flight.\n   - `dur_arr` maps city indices to their respective durations.\n   - `pos0` and `pos4` find the positions of Oslo and Tallinn in the sequence.\n   - `start0` and `start4` compute the start days for Oslo and Tallinn, enforcing their constraints.\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a valid sequence is found, the start and end days for each city are computed by accumulating the durations, considering that each subsequent city starts on the end day of the previous city (due to travel days being shared). The itinerary is printed, showing the city sequence with their respective start and end days."
