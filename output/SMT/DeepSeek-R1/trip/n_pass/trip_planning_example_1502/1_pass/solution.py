        # Now, for each flight day (i.e., a day where a departure and arrival coincide), we add single day entries for both cities
        # But note: the example output includes both the continuous and the single day for the flight day.
        # So we add for each city, for the departure day (if it is also an arrival day for the next) we already have the continuous, but we need to add a single day for the next city on that day?
        # Actually, the example: 
        #   {"day_range": "Day 1-3", "place": "Venice"}, 
        #   {"day_range": "Day 3", "place": "Venice"}, 
        #   {"day_range": "Day 3", "place": "Vienna"}, 
        #   {"day_range": "Day 3-5", "place": "Vienna"}
        # We already have "Day 1-3" for Venice and "Day 3-5" for Vienna. Then we add:
        #   {"day_range": "Day 3", "place": "Venice"}
        #   {"day_range": "Day 3", "place": "Vienna"}
        # So we need to add for every city, every day in the stay as a single day? 
        # But that would be too many. Alternatively, we only need to add the flight days? But the example includes every day as a single day? 
        # Rereading the example: they include the continuous block, and then separately for the flight day they break the continuous block at the flight day and add single day for both.
        #
        # How to do it: 
        #   For each city, for the departure day, we add a single day entry for that city on that day.
        #   For each city, for the arrival day, we add a single day entry for that city on that day.
        #   But note: if a city has a continuous stay without flight on the first or last day, we don't need to break? 
        #   However, the example output includes the continuous block and then the single day for the flight day separately.
        #
        # We'll do:
        #   For each city, we add a single day entry for the arrival day and for the departure day.
        #   But note: if the stay is only one day, we already have a single day entry and we don't add another.
        #
        # However, the problem says: "For flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city."
        # And also: "For flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city"
        # So we only need to do this for days that are flight days? But the example includes the flight day (day3) for both, even though it's the last day of Venice and first day of Vienna.
        #
        # We can simply: for every city and for every day in [a_vals[city], d_vals[city]], we add a single day entry.
        # But that would be 27 * 10 = 270 entries? But we only have 27 days and 10 cities, but not all days are used by all cities.
        # Alternatively, we can add only the flight days? But the example output includes non-flight days as well? 
        #   The example includes "Day 1-3" and then "Day 3", and "Day 3" and "Day 3-5". 
        #   So they include both the continuous and the single day for the boundary days.
        #
        # We'll follow the example: 
        #   For each city, we add:
        #       The continuous block: e.g., "Day 1-3"
        #       Then for each day in the block that is either the arrival or departure day of a flight, we add a single day? 
        #   But the example does not do that: they added the continuous block and then added the boundary day as a single day.
        #
        # Actually, the example has:
        #   {"day_range": "Day 1-3", "place": "Venice"}   -> the whole block
        #   {"day_range": "Day 3", "place": "Venice"}      -> the last day (flight day)
        #   {"day_range": "Day 3", "place": "Vienna"}      -> the first day (flight day)
        #   {"day_range": "Day 3-5", "place": "Vienna"}    -> the whole block
        #
        # So we will do:
        #   For each city, we add the continuous block.
        #   Additionally, for each flight day (i.e., any day that is either an arrival or departure of a flight) we add a single day for that city on that day.
        #   But note: the flight days are the days where a city is departed from or arrived at. And these are exactly the arrival and departure days of each city.
        #
        # Therefore, for each city, we add two single-day entries: one for the arrival day and one for the departure day, unless the stay is only one day (then we already have one entry and we don't need extra).
        #
        # However, the example has an extra entry for the continuous block and then the single day for the boundaries. 
        # We have already added the continuous block. Now, we add for each city and for each day that is an arrival or a departure, a single day entry, but note:
        #   For a one-day stay, we have one continuous entry (which is the same as the single day) and then we would add two more? 
        #   So we must avoid duplicates?
        #
        # We can do: 
        #   We'll create a list of events: for each city, for each day from a_vals[city] to d_vals[city]:
        #        we add an entry for that city and that day as a single day.
        #   But then we would have multiple entries for the same day and city? 
        #   And also, we don't need the continuous block if we do that? 
        #   The example output includes both.
        #
        # Let me re-read: "For flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city."
        # and "For flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city"
        # So they want both the continuous block and the single day for the flight day. 
        #
        # We'll do as the example: 
        #   For a city with a multi-day stay, we have:
        #        {day_range: "Day X-Y", place: city}   for the entire stay
        #        and then separately, for the day when there is a flight (either arrival or departure), we add a single day for that city on that day.
        #   But note: the example added for Venice (which is the departure) on day3 and for Vienna (which is the arrival) on day3.
        #   They did not add single days for non-flight days.
        #
        # How to identify a flight day for a city? 
        #   The arrival day of a city is a flight day (if the city is not the first city, then we flew into it)
        #   The departure day of a city is a flight day (if the city is not the last city, then we flew out)
        #
        # So we will add:
        #   For each city that is not the start (a_i > 1), then the arrival day is a flight day -> add a single day for that city on a_i.
        #   For each city that is not the end (d_i < 27), then the departure day is a flight day -> add a single day for that city on d_i.
        #
        # But note: a city might be visited in the middle: then both arrival and departure are flight days.
        # Also, a city that is the start: then the arrival day (day1) is not a flight day? but we might fly out on the departure day? 
        #   So for the start, we add a single day for the departure day (if it flies out).
        #   Similarly, for the end, we add a single day for the arrival day (if it was flown into).
        #
        # Actually, the problem says: flight days are when we take a flight. So if we start in a city, we didn't fly in, so the start day is not a flight day? 
        #   But the example doesn't say anything about the start. 
        #   And the end: we don't fly out, so the last day is not a flight day.
        #
        # Therefore, we'll add:
        #   For each city, if the arrival day is not the start of the whole trip (i.e., a_i != 1), then add a single day for that city on a_i.
        #   For each city, if the departure day is not the end of the whole trip (i.e., d_i != 27), then add a single day for that city on d_i.
        #
        # But note: the flight day might be the same as the continuous block's boundary? And we are already including the continuous block. 
        #   The example output includes the continuous block and then the single day for the boundary flight day.
        #
        # We'll do exactly that.
        #
        # However, note that a city might have an arrival flight and then stay for multiple days and then a departure flight. 
        #   We add the continuous block and then the two single days for the flight days (arrival and departure) if applicable.
        #
        # But what if the city has a one-day stay and is in the middle? 
        #   Then we would have:
        #        continuous: Day X for the city
        #        and then two single days? but the arrival and departure are the same day? 
        #   So we would have:
        #        {"day_range": "Day X", "place": city}   [from the continuous block]
        #        and then we would add for the arrival flight: {"day_range": "Day X", "place": city}  [duplicate]
        #        and for the departure flight: {"day_range": "Day X", "place": city}  [duplicate]
        #   So three entries for the same city and day.
        #
        #   But the problem says: for flight days, create separate records. And the example output for a one-day stay might be represented as:
        #        {"day_range": "Day X", "place": city}   (from the continuous)
        #        and then one more for the flight day? but the flight day is the same as the continuous day.
        #   However, the problem says "repeat the day record", so we would have two entries? 
        #
        #   The example output for a one-day stay would be:
        #        {"day_range": "Day X", "place": city}   [continuous]
        #        and then if it is a flight day (both arrival and departure) we would add two more? 
        #   But the problem says for the flight day, we are in both cities. So for a one-day stay in city A with flight in and out on the same day, we would be in city A on that day, and also in the previous and next cities? 
        #   However, the rule: if you fly from A to B on day X, you are in both A and B on day X. But here, we fly into A from X and then out from A to Y on the same day? 
        #   So we are in the previous city, A, and the next city on day X? 
        #   Therefore, we would need to represent:
        #        continuous: Day X for city A
        #        and then for the flight in: we are in A on day X (so add one)
        #        and for the flight out: we are in A on day X (so add one) -> but that would be three entries for A on day X?
        #
        #   But the example output does not have duplicates for the same city on the same day. 
        #   The example output for a flight day has two entries: one for the departure city and one for the arrival city. 
        #   For a one-day city, we would have:
        #        continuous: one entry for A on day X
        #        and then for the flight from prev to A: we add an entry for A on day X? and for the flight from A to next: we add an entry for A on day X? -> that's three for A.
        #   This seems redundant.
        #
        # Let's reexamine the example: 
        #   They have Venice from 1-3 and then Venice on day3, and then Vienna on day3 and then Vienna from 3-5.
        #   So for Venice, they have two entries: the continuous and the single for the flight day (departure).
        #   For Vienna, they have two entries: the single for the flight day (arrival) and the continuous.
        #   So for a one-day city, we would need:
        #        continuous: one entry (for the one day)
        #        and then one entry for the flight in (if applicable) and one for the flight out (if applicable) -> but that would be three for the same city and day.
        #
        #   Alternatively, we can interpret: the one-day stay is represented by the continuous block entry. 
        #   And then the flight in and flight out are already covered by the continuous block? 
        #   So we only need to add the flight in and flight out for the connecting cities? 
        #
        #   The problem says: "For flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city."
        #   This means that for a flight from A to B on day X, we must have an entry for A on day X and an entry for B on day X.
        #   The continuous block for A might already include day X (if A is from a_i to d_i, and X is d_i) and similarly for B.
        #   So we only need to ensure that there is an entry for A on day X and for B on day X. 
        #   The continuous block already provides that? 
        #   Then why did the example add extra? 
        #   The example added extra to explicitly mark the flight day? 
        #
        #   Given the confusion, we will follow the example output structure exactly: 
        #        They output the continuous block and then the boundary days (flight days) as single days.
        #   So we will do the same: 
        #        For each city, output the continuous block.
        #        Then, for the arrival day of the city (if it is a flight day, i.e., if the city is not the first city) output a single day for that city on that day.
        #        Then, for the departure day of the city (if it is a flight day, i.e., if the city is not the last city) output a single day for that city on that day.
        #   But note: if the city has a one-day stay, then we have:
        #        continuous: one entry for day X.
        #        and then two more: one for arrival and one for departure? -> three entries.
        #   This matches the example? 
        #   In the example, for a one-day city, we would have:
        #        {"day_range": "Day X", "place": city}   [continuous]
        #        {"day_range": "Day X", "place": city}   [arrival flight day]
        #        {"day_range": "Day X", "place": city}   [departure flight day]
        #   But that's three identical entries.
        #
        #   Alternatively, we can output for the flight days only once per city per boundary? 
        #   And the problem does not require to avoid duplicates.
        #
        #   We'll do as described.
        #
        # Steps for the itinerary list:
        #   First, add for every city the continuous block.
        #   Then, for every city, if the city is not the start (i.e., a_i != 1), then add {"day_range": f"Day {a_vals[city]}", "place": city}
        #   Then, for every city, if the city is not the end (i.e., d_i != 27), then add {"day_range": f"Day {d_vals[city]}", "place": city}
        #
        #   But note: the continuous block for a one-day city is already added, and then we add two more for the same day? 
        #   That's three for a one-day city. 
        #   The example output for a one-day city might be represented as three entries? 
        #   Let's assume that is acceptable.
        #
        # However, the example output for Venice and Vienna does not have duplicates for the same city on the same day in the continuous and the single? 
        #   They have one continuous for Venice and then one single for Venice on the flight day (which is the same as the last day of the continuous) -> so two entries for Venice on day3.
        #   Similarly for Vienna: two entries for day3.
        #   So duplicates per city per day are allowed.
        #
        # We'll do:
        itinerary = []
        # First, continuous blocks
        for city in cities:
            start = a_vals[city]
            end = d_vals[city]
            if start == end:
                itinerary.append({"day_range": f"Day {start}", "place": city})
            else:
                itinerary.append({"day_range": f"Day {start}-{end}", "place": city})
        # Then, for flight days: 
        #   For each city, if it has an arrival flight (i.e., it is not the start), then add the arrival day as a single day.
        #   For each city, if it has a departure flight (i.e., it is not the end), then add the departure day as a single day.
        for city in cities:
            if a_vals[city] != 1:
                itinerary.append({"day_range": f"Day {a_vals[city]}", "place": city})
            if d_vals[city] != 27:
                itinerary.append({"day_range": f"Day {d_vals[city]}", "place": city})
        
        # Now, we have the itinerary list. But the order in the list is arbitrary? 
        # The problem does not specify the order of the records. We can sort by the day_range? 
        # But the day_range might be a string. We can try to sort by the first day mentioned in the day_range.
        # However, the example output does not specify order. 
        # We'll leave as is.
