You have to attend a workshop in Prague between day 1 and day 2.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPrague and Lyon, Prague and Frankfurt, Frankfurt and Lyon, Helsinki and Naples, Helsinki and Frankfurt, Naples and Frankfurt, Prague and Helsinki.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\nNote that if one flies from city A to city B on day X, then they are in both cities A and B on day X, which contributes to the total number of days in each city.\nYour output should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with an 'itinerary' key containing a list of day-place mappings.\nFor flight days, create separate records for both the departure city and arrival city.\nFor flight days, repeat the day record for both the departure city and arrival city (e.g., if staying in Venice from Day 1-3 and flying to Vienna on Day 3, include {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}).\nExample structure: {\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Venice\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}]}\nWrite a Python program that solves it using the Z3 solver.

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 12-day itinerary for visiting 5 European cities (Prague, Helsinki, Frankfurt, Naples, Lyon) while adhering to specific constraints on the number of days spent in each city, fixed events, and direct flight availability between cities. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to model the problem and find a valid itinerary.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires scheduling visits to 5 cities over 12 days with specific constraints:\n   - Spend exactly 3 days in Frankfurt, 4 days in Naples, 4 days in Helsinki, 3 days in Lyon, and 2 days in Prague.\n   - Attend a workshop in Prague between days 1 and 2, and an annual show in Helsinki from days 2 to 5.\n   - Only direct flights between certain city pairs are available.\n\n2. **Modeling with Z3**:\n   - **Variables**: Define `start_city` and `end_city` for each day (1-12) representing the city at the start and end of the day.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - Fixed events: Days 1-2 in Prague, days 2-5 in Helsinki.\n     - Direct flights: If a flight occurs on a day (start and end cities differ), the flight must be between cities with direct flights.\n     - Continuity: The start city of the next day must match the end city of the current day.\n     - Total days: Ensure the total days in each city meet the specified requirements.\n   - **Solving**: Use Z3 to find a valid assignment of cities to days that satisfies all constraints.\n\n3. **Itinerary Construction**:\n   - For each city, determine continuous stay segments and flight days.\n   - Generate itinerary records:\n     - Continuous stays as ranges (e.g., \"Day 1-2\").\n     - Flight days as individual day entries for both departure and arrival cities.\n   - Sort records by the starting day of each segment.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport z3\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    #
