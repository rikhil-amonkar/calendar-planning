        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 25-day itinerary for visiting 8 European cities, adhering to specific duration constraints for each city and ensuring direct flights between consecutive cities. The solution must account for fixed events in Edinburgh (days 5-8) and Split (days 19-23) and satisfy all given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling visits to 8 cities over 25 days, with each city having a specific duration of stay. Fixed events in Edinburgh (days 5-8) and Split (days 19-23) must be honored. Direct flights between cities must be used for travel, and flight days are counted in both the departure and arrival cities.\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent cities as nodes and direct flights as edges in an undirected graph. This graph will be used to ensure consecutive cities in the itinerary have a direct flight connection.\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**: Use the Z3 solver to find a valid sequence of cities. Define variables for the order of cities and their start days. Constraints include:\n   - Each city appears exactly once in the sequence.\n   - The start day of the first city is day 1, and the end day of the last city is day 25.\n   - The duration of stay for each city matches the given requirements.\n   - Fixed start days for Edinburgh (day 5) and Split (day 19).\n   - Consecutive cities in the sequence must have a direct flight connection.\n4. **Itinerary Construction**: After solving for the sequence and start days, construct the itinerary. For each city, include a continuous block for the entire stay. For each flight day (transition between cities), include separate entries for both the departure and arrival cities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    cities = [\"Vienna\", \"Lyon\", \"Edinburgh\", \"Reykjavik\", \"Stuttgart\", \"Manchester\", \"Split\", \"Prague\"]\n    durations = [4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 2, 5, 4]\n    \n    graph = {\n        0: [4, 7, 5, 1, 3, 6],   # Vienna\n        1: [0, 6, 7],              # Lyon\n        2: [7, 4],                 # Edinburgh\n        3: [0, 4, 7],              # Reykjavik\n        4: [3, 6, 0, 2, 5],        # Stuttgart\n        5: [7, 6, 0, 4],           # Manchester\n        6: [4, 5, 7, 1, 0],        # Split\n        7: [5, 2, 0, 6, 1, 3]      # Prague\n    }\n    \n    s = Solver()\n    \n    n = 8\n    order = [Int(f\"order_{i}\") for i in range(n)]\n    start = [Int(f\"start_{i}\") for i in range(n)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        s.add(order[i] >= 0, order[i] < n)\n    s.add(Distinct(order))\n    \n    s.add(start[0] == 1)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        s.add(start[i+1] == start[i] + durations[order[i]] - 1)\n    s.add(start[n-1] + durations[order[n-1]] - 1 == 25)\n    \n    for j in range(n):\n        s.add(If(order[j] == 2, start[j] == 5, True))\n        s.add(If(order[j] == 6, start[j] == 19, True))\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        current = order[i]\n        next_city = order[i+1]\n        edges = graph[current]\n        s.add(Or([next_city == adj for adj in edges]))\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        model = s.model()\n        order_val = [model.evaluate(order[i]).as_long() for i in range(n)]\n        start_val = [model.evaluate(start[i]).as_long() for i in range(n)]\n        end_val = [start_val[i] + durations[order_val[i]] - 1 for i in range(n)]\n        \n        itinerary = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            city_name = cities[order_val[i]]\n            s_day = start_val[i]\n            e_day = end_val[i]\n            if s_day == e_day:\n                day_range_str = f\"Day {s_day}\"\n            else:\n                day_range_str = f\"Day {s_day}-{e_day}\"\n            itinerary.append({\"day_range\": day_range_str, \"place\": city_name})\n            \n            if i < n-1:\n                flight_day = end_val[i]\n                itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {flight_day}\", \"place\": city_name})\n                next_city_name = cities[order_val[i+1]]\n                itinerary.append({\"day_range\": f\"Day {flight_day}\", \"place\": next_city_name})\n        \n        result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary}\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Representation**: The cities and direct flights are represented as an undirected graph using adjacency lists. For example, Vienna (index 0) is connected to Stuttgart, Prague, etc.\n2. **Z3 Variables and Constraints**: \n   - `order` represents the sequence of cities.\n   - `start` represents the start day for each city.\n   - Constraints ensure the sequence starts on day 1 and ends on day 25, with each city's duration met.\n   - Fixed start days for Edinburgh (day 5) and Split (day 19) are enforced.\n   - Consecutive cities must have a direct flight connection per the graph.\n3. **Itinerary Construction**: \n   - For each city, a continuous block of days (e.g., \"Day 1-3\") is added.\n   - For each transition between cities, separate entries for the departure and arrival cities on the flight day (e.g., \"Day 3\") are added.\n4. **Output**: The itinerary is printed as a JSON-formatted dictionary with the sequence of day-place mappings, including both continuous stays and flight days. The solution ensures all constraints are satisfied, including fixed events and flight connections."
