You want to meet a friend in Reykjavik between day 9 and day 13. You would like to visit Stockholm for 4 days. You want to spend 4 days in Munich.

        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 20-day itinerary for visiting 8 European cities while adhering to specific constraints regarding the duration of stays in each city, attending events on particular days, and ensuring that all flights between cities are direct. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires scheduling visits to 8 cities over 20 days with specific constraints:\n   - Fixed durations in each city (Oslo: 2 days, Reykjavik: 5 days, Stockholm: 4 days, Munich: 4 days, Frankfurt: 4 days, Barcelona: 3 days, Bucharest: 2 days, Split: 3 days).\n   - Specific events in Oslo (days 16-17), Reykjavik (days 9-13), Munich (days 13-16), and Frankfurt (days 17-20).\n   - Direct flights between certain cities must be used for travel.\n\n2. **Modeling the Itinerary**:\n   - **Base City Variables**: Represent each day's starting and ending city with 21 variables (days 0 to 20) where `base_city[i]` is the city at the end of day `i` (and start of day `i+1`).\n   - **Flight Constraints**: If the base city changes between consecutive days, there must be a direct flight between the two cities.\n   - **Duration Constraints**: Ensure the total days spent in each city meet the specified durations. Days involving flights count towards both the departure and arrival cities.\n   - **Event Constraints**: Ensure presence in specific cities during specified day ranges (Oslo on days 16-17, Reykjavik between days 9-13, Munich between days 13-16, Frankfurt between days 17-20).\n\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**:\n   - Define integer variables for `base_city[0..20]`.\n   - Add constraints for city transitions (direct flights only), duration requirements, and event attendance.\n   - Solve the model to find a valid itinerary.\n\n4. **Output Generation**:\n   - **Blocks of Consecutive Days**: Group consecutive days in the same city into blocks (e.g., \"Day 1-3: Venice\").\n   - **Flight Days**: For days involving flights, output separate entries for departure and arrival cities (e.g., \"Day 3: Venice\", \"Day 3: Vienna\").\n   - **JSON Output**: Format the itinerary as a JSON dictionary with the itinerary list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\nimport json\n\n# Mapping of cities to integers\ncity_map = {\n    \"Oslo\": 0,\n    \"Reykjavik\": 1,\n    \"Stockholm\": 2,\n    \"Munich\": 3,  #

The output is formatted as specified, providing a clear and structured travel plan."
