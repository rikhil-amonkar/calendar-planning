        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 26-day itinerary for visiting 10 European cities, adhering to specific constraints on the duration of stays in each city and fixed events that must occur on certain days. The solution must ensure that travel between cities is done via direct flights only.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling visits to 10 cities over 26 days with constraints:\n   - Fixed durations for stays in each city.\n   - Fixed events in specific cities on certain days (e.g., a workshop in Prague on days 1-3).\n   - Direct flights between certain pairs of cities.\n   - On a flight day, the traveler is considered to be in both the departure and arrival cities.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Fixed Events**: These dictate that the traveler must be in specific cities on certain days (e.g., in Prague on days 1, 2, and 3).\n   - **Flight Days**: When traveling between cities on a flight day, the traveler is counted in both cities for that day.\n   - **Consecutive Stays**: The itinerary must account for consecutive stays in cities, broken only by flight days.\n\n3. **Modeling with Z3 Solver**:\n   - **Variables**: Represent the start city for each day (days 1 to 27, with day 27 being the same as day 26).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - **Domain Constraints**: Each day's start city must be one of the 10 cities.\n     - **Flight Constraints**: If the start city changes between consecutive days, there must be a direct flight between them.\n     - **Fixed Event Constraints**: Ensure the traveler is in the required cities on specified days.\n     - **Total Days Constraints**: The total days spent in each city must match the required duration.\n   - **Solution Extraction**: After solving, extract the sequence of cities and generate the itinerary, including both consecutive stays and individual flight days.\n\n4. **Itinerary Construction**:\n   - **Consecutive Blocks**: For each city, identify consecutive days of stay and represent them as blocks (e.g., \"Day 1-3\").\n   - **Flight Days**: For each flight day, add entries for both departure and arrival cities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport z3\nimport json\n\ndef

**Initialization**: The code initializes the list of cities, their required stay durations, and fixed events.\n2. **Flight Setup**: It processes the direct flight information into a matrix indicating valid flights between cities.\n3. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver is configured with variables representing the start city for each day. Constraints ensure:\n   - The traveler starts in Prague.\n   - Flights between cities are valid (direct flights).\n   - Fixed events are respected (specific cities on specific days).\n   - Total days in each city meet the required durations.\n4. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution is found, the itinerary is constructed by:\n   - Grouping consecutive days spent in each city into blocks.\n   - Adding entries for flight days (both departure and arrival cities).\n   - Sorting the itinerary by day.\n5. **Output**: The itinerary is printed in JSON format, including both consecutive stay blocks and individual flight day entries. If no solution is found, an empty itinerary is printed."
