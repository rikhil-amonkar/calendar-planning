        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 14-day itinerary for visiting four European cities (Split, Vilnius, Santorini, and Madrid) while adhering to specific constraints on the number of days spent in each city and direct flight connections between them. The solution must ensure that the itinerary includes the required days in each city, accounts for flight days where travelers are present in both departure and arrival cities, and ends with the conference in Santorini on days 13 and 14.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling visits to four cities over 14 days with specific day constraints:\n   - Split: 5 days\n   - Vilnius: 4 days\n   - Santorini: 2 days (must include days 13 and 14)\n   - Madrid: 6 days\n   Direct flights are only available between Vilnius-Split, Split-Madrid, and Madrid-Santorini. The itinerary must start on day 1 and end on day 14, with flight days counted in both the departure and arrival cities.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The cities form a linear path (Vilnius \u2192 Split \u2192 Madrid \u2192 Santorini) due to direct flight constraints. The itinerary must follow this path without revisiting cities to minimize flight days (exactly 3 flights for 4 cities).\n\n3. **Constraints Handling**:\n   - **Vilnius Stay**: Starts on day 1 and ends on day `X` (4 days total).\n   - **Split Stay**: Starts on day `X` and ends on day `Y` (5 days total).\n   - **Madrid Stay**: Starts on day `Y` and ends on day `Z` (6 days total).\n   - **Santorini Stay**: Starts on day `Z` and ends on day 14 (2 days total).\n\n4. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - Vilnius: `X - 1 + 1 = 4` \u2192 `X = 4`\n   - Split: `Y - X + 1 = 5` \u2192 `Y = X + 4 = 8`\n   - Madrid: `Z - Y + 1 = 6` \u2192 `Z = Y + 5 = 13`\n   - Santorini: `14 - Z + 1 = 2` \u2192 `Z = 13`\n\n5. **Z3 Solver**: The Z3 theorem prover is used to solve the system of equations derived from the constraints. The variables `X`, `Y`, and `Z` represent the end days of stays in Vilnius, Split, and Madrid, respectively.\n\n6. **Itinerary Construction**: After solving for `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, the itinerary is constructed by:\n   - Listing continuous stays in each city.\n   - Adding separate entries for flight days (departure and arrival).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import Solver, Int, sat\n\ndef main():\n    s = Solver()\n    X = Int('X')\n    Y = Int('Y')\n    Z = Int('Z')\n    \n    s.add(X >= 1, X <= 14)\n    s.add(Y >= X, Y <= 14)\n    s.add(Z >= Y, Z <= 14)\n    \n    s.add(Y - X + 1 == 5)\n    s.add(Z - Y + 1 == 6)\n    s.add(14 - Z + 1 == 2)\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        X_val = m[X].as_long()\n        Y_val = m[Y].as_long()\n        Z_val = m[Z].as_long()\n        \n        itinerary = [\n            {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-{}\".format(X_val), \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n            {\"day_range\": \"Day {}\".format(X_val), \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n            {\"day_range\": \"Day {}\".format(X_val), \"place\": \"Split\"},\n            {\"day_range\": \"Day {}-{}\".format(X_val, Y_val), \"place\": \"Split\"},\n            {\"day_range\": \"Day {}\".format(Y_val), \"place\": \"Split\"},\n            {\"day_range\": \"Day {}\".format(Y_val), \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n            {\"day_range\": \"Day {}-{}\".format(Y_val, Z_val), \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n            {\"day_range\": \"Day {}\".format(Z_val), \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n            {\"day_range\": \"Day {}\".format(Z_val), \"place\": \"Santorini\"},\n            {\"day_range\": \"Day {}-14\".format(Z_val), \"place\": \"Santorini\"}\n        ]\n        \n        result = {\"itinerary\": itinerary}\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Z3 Solver Setup**: The solver is initialized with integer variables `X`, `Y`, and `Z` representing the end days of stays in Vilnius, Split, and Madrid, respectively.\n2. **Constraints**: The solver adds constraints to ensure:\n   - The end days are within the 14-day range and follow the sequence (Vilnius before Split before Madrid before Santorini).\n   - The length of stays in each city matches the required days (4 in Vilnius, 5 in Split, 6 in Madrid, and 2 in Santorini).\n3. **Solution Extraction**: If a solution exists, the values of `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are extracted and used to construct the itinerary.\n4. **Itinerary Construction**: The itinerary includes:\n   - Continuous stays in each city (e.g., \"Day 1-4\" for Vilnius).\n   - Separate entries for flight days (e.g., \"Day 4\" for both Vilnius departure and Split arrival).\n5. **Output**: The resulting itinerary is printed as a dictionary in the specified JSON-like format.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem constraints using Z3 and constructs a valid itinerary that meets all given requirements."
