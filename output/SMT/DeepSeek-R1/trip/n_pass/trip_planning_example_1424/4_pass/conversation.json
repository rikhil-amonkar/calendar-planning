        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 27-day trip plan for visiting 10 European cities, ensuring that all given constraints are satisfied. The constraints include specific stay durations in each city, fixed events on certain days, and direct flight requirements between cities. We use the Z3 solver to model and solve this problem efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves visiting 10 cities over 27 days with specific constraints:\n   - Each city has a required number of stay days.\n   - Fixed events in certain cities on specific days (e.g., workshop in Porto between days 1-5, conference in Naples on days 17-20).\n   - Direct flights between cities are the only mode of travel.\n   - On a flight day, the traveler is in both the departure and arrival cities.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The total stay days across all cities sum to 36, but the trip duration is 27 days. This discrepancy is resolved by accounting for 9 flight days where each flight day contributes to the stay count of two cities.\n\n3. **Modeling**:\n   - **Base City Variables**: Represent the city at the end of each day (28 variables for days 0 to 27).\n   - **Flight Variables**: Boolean variables indicating if a flight occurs on each day (27 variables for days 1 to 27).\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - If no flight on day `i`, the base city remains the same.\n     - If a flight occurs, the departure and arrival cities must have a direct flight.\n     - Exactly 9 flights occur over 27 days.\n     - Total stay days per city match the requirements.\n     - Fixed event days (e.g., Naples on days 17-20, Brussels on days 20-22) are satisfied.\n     - At least one day in Porto during days 1-5, Amsterdam during days 5-8, and Helsinki during days 8-11.\n\n4. **Solution Extraction**: After solving the constraints, the solution is extracted by determining the cities visited each day based on flight activities and base city transitions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    cities = [\"Warsaw\", \"Porto\", \"Naples\", \"Brussels\", \"Split\", \"Reykjavik\",

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create a 27-day travel itinerary that starts in Porto and ends in Split, visiting each of the 15 cities exactly once. The itinerary must adhere to constraints such as using only direct flights between connected cities and not staying in the same city for more than 3 consecutive days without flying.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and their direct flight connections as an undirected graph.\n2. **Path Finding**: Use Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization to find a Hamiltonian path (a path that visits each city exactly once) from Porto to Split. The memoization stores states to avoid redundant computations, where each state is defined by the current city and a bitmask representing visited cities.\n3. **Stay Days Assignment**: \n   - Assign 1 stay day to the first city (Porto) and 1 stay day to the last city (Split).\n   - Distribute the remaining 11 stay days among 11 of the 13 intermediate cities (each gets 1 stay day), leaving 2 intermediate cities with 0 stay days.\n4. **Itinerary Construction**: \n   - Start with stay days in Porto.\n   - For each subsequent city, fly to the city and then spend the assigned stay days there.\n   - Ensure the last day is a stay day in Split.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(10000)\n\ngraph = {\n    'Amsterdam': ['Dublin', 'Brussels', 'Helsinki', 'Munich'],\n    'Athens': ['Prague', 'Valencia', 'Munich', 'Stockholm', 'Helsinki'],\n    'Brussels': ['Amsterdam', 'Dublin', 'Prague', 'Munich'],\n    'Dublin': ['Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Prague', 'Valencia', 'Porto'],\n    'Helsinki': ['Amsterdam', 'Athens', 'Stockholm', 'Reykjavik'],\n    'Lyon': ['Valencia', 'Munich', 'Naples', 'Split'],\n    'Munich': ['Amsterdam', 'Athens', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Lyon', 'Prague', 'Valencia', 'Warsaw'],\n    'Naples': ['Lyon', 'Prague', 'Valencia', 'Warsaw'],\n    'Porto': ['Dublin', 'Valencia'],\n    'Prague': ['Athens', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Munich', 'Naples', 'Stockholm', 'Warsaw'],\n    'Reykjavik': ['Helsinki', 'Warsaw'],\n    'Split': ['Lyon', 'Warsaw'],\n    'Stockholm': ['Athens', 'Helsinki', 'Prague'],\n    'Valencia': ['Athens', 'Dublin', 'Lyon', 'Munich', 'Naples', 'Porto'],\n    'Warsaw': ['Munich', 'Naples', 'Prague', 'Split', 'Reykjavik']\n}\n\ncities_list = sorted(graph.keys())\nn = len(cities_list)\ncity_to_index = {city: idx for idx, city in enumerate(cities_list)}\nindex_to_city = {idx: city for idx, city in enumerate(cities_list)}\n\nstart_city = 'Porto'\nend_city = 'Split'\nstart_index = city_to_index[start_city]\nend_index = city_to_index[end_city]\n\nall_done = (1 << n) - 1\n\nmemo = {}\n\ndef dfs(current, mask):\n    if mask == all_done:\n        if current == end_city:\n            return [current]\n        else:\n            return None\n            \n    key = (current, mask)\n    if key in memo:\n        return memo[key]\n        \n    for neighbor in graph[current]:\n        idx = city_to_index[neighbor]\n        if mask & (1 << idx):\n            continue\n        new_mask = mask | (1 << idx)\n        res = dfs(neighbor, new_mask)\n        if res is not None:\n            path = [current] + res\n            memo[key] = path\n            return path\n            \n    memo[key] = None\n    return None\n\nstart_mask = 1 << start_index\npath = dfs(start_city, start_mask)\n\nif path is None:\n    print(\"No valid path found\")\nelse:\n    s = [0] * 15\n    s[0] = 1\n    s[14] = 1\n    for i in range(1, 12):\n        s[i] = 1\n    s[12] = 0\n    s[13] = 0\n\n    current_day = 1\n    itinerary = []\n    itinerary.append(f\"Day {current_day}: Stay in {path[0]}\")\n    current_day += 1\n\n    for i in range(1, len(path)):\n        itinerary.append(f\"Day {current_day}: Fly from {path[i-1]} to {path[i]}\")\n        current_day += 1\n        if s[i] > 0:\n            for j in range(s[i]):\n                itinerary.append(f\"Day {current_day}: Stay in {path[i]}\")\n                current_day += 1\n\n    for line in itinerary:\n        print(line)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is built using a dictionary where each key is a city, and its value is a list of cities connected by direct flights.\n2. **Path Finding**: The DFS function recursively explores all possible paths from Porto to Split, using a bitmask to track visited cities.
