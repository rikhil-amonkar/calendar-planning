        "content": "To solve this scheduling problem, we need to create a 21-day itinerary for visiting 8 European cities while adhering to specific constraints on the duration of stay in each city, direct flight connections between cities, and certain fixed-day requirements. The solution involves using the Z3 solver to model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires visiting 8 cities (Brussels, Bucharest, Stuttgart, Mykonos, Madrid, Helsinki, Split, London) over 21 days. Each city has a specific number of days to be spent there. Direct flights between cities are given, and travel between cities must use these direct flights. Additional constraints include:\n   - Fixed days in Madrid (days 20 and 21).\n   - At least one day in Stuttgart between days 1 and 4.\n   - The day of travel counts as a day in both the departure and arrival cities.\n\n2. **Modeling**:\n   - **Variables**: Define a variable for each day (1 to 21) representing the city visited on that day.\n   - **Flight Constraints**: Ensure consecutive days either stay in the same city or move to a city connected by a direct flight.\n   - **Total Days Calculation**: For each city, calculate the total days spent, considering both the days the city was the starting point and the days it was the arrival point (due to travel).\n   - **Fixed Constraints**: Enforce Madrid on days 20 and 21, and ensure Stuttgart is visited between days 1 and 4.\n   - **Duration Constraints**: Ensure the total days spent in each city matches the specified requirements.\n\n3. **Z3 Solver**: Use the Z3 solver to find a satisfying assignment for the variables under all constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef main():\n    cities_str = ['Brussels', 'Bucharest', 'Stuttgart', 'Mykonos', 'Madrid', 'Helsinki', 'Split', 'London']\n    \n    flights_str = [\n        ('Helsinki', 'London'),\n        ('Split', 'Madrid'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Madrid'),\n        ('London', 'Madrid'),\n        ('Brussels', 'London'),\n        ('Bucharest', 'London'),\n        ('Brussels', 'Bucharest'),\n        ('Bucharest', 'Madrid'),\n        ('Split', 'Helsinki'),\n        ('Mykonos', 'Madrid'),\n        ('Stuttgart', 'London'),\n        ('Helsinki', 'Brussels'),\n        ('Brussels', 'Madrid'),\n        ('Split', 'London'),\n        ('Stuttgart', 'Split'),\n        ('London', 'Mykonos')\n    ]\n    \n    City = Datatype('City')\n    for c in cities_str:\n        City.declare(c)\n    City = City.create()\n    \n    city_dict = {}\n    for c in cities_str:\n        city_dict[c] = getattr(City, c)\n    \n    flight_pairs = []\n    for (a, b) in flights_str:\n        flight_pairs.append((city_dict[a], city_dict[b]))\n        flight_pairs.append((city_dict[b], city_dict[a]))\n    \n    x = [Const('x_%d' % i, City) for i in range(1, 22)]\n    \n    s = Solver()\n    \n    for i in range(20):\n        s.add(If(x[i] != x[i + 1],\n                 Or([And(x[i] == a, x[i + 1] == b) for (a, b) in flight_pairs]),\n                 True))\n    \n    def total_days(c):\n        cond1 = [If(x[i] == c, 1, 0) for i in range(21)]\n        cond2 = [If(And(x[i] != x[i + 1], x[i + 1] == c), 1, 0) for i in range(20)]\n        return Sum(cond1 + cond2)\n    \n    s.add(total_days(city_dict['Brussels']) == 4)\n    s.add(total_days(city_dict['Bucharest']) == 3)\n    s.add(total_days(city_dict['Stuttgart']) == 4)\n    s.add(total_days(city_dict['Mykonos']) == 2)\n    s.add(total_days(city_dict['Madrid']) == 2)\n    s.add(total_days(city_dict['Helsinki']) == 5)\n    s.add(total_days(city_dict['Split']) == 3)\n    s.add(total_days(city_dict['London']) == 5)\n    \n    s.add(x[19] == city_dict['Madrid'])\n    s.add(x[20] == city_dict['Madrid'])\n    \n    in1 = Or(x[0] == city_dict['Stuttgart'], And(x[0] != x[1], x[1] == city_dict['Stuttgart']))\n    in2 = Or(x[1] == city_dict['Stuttgart'], And(x[1] != x[2], x[2] == city_dict['Stuttgart']))\n    in3 = Or(x[2] == city_dict['Stuttgart'], And(x[2] != x[3], x[3] == city_dict['Stuttgart']))\n    in4 = Or(x[3] == city_dict['Stuttgart'], And(x[3] != x[4], x[4] == city_dict['Stuttgart']))\n    s.add(Or(in1, in2, in3, in4))\n    \n    if s.check() == sat:\n        m = s.model()\n        res = [m.eval(x_i) for x_i in x]\n        city_names = {city_dict[c]: c for c in cities_str}\n        for i in range(21):\n            day = i + 1\n            city = city_names[res[i]]\n            print(f\"Day {day}: {city}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **City and Flight Setup**: The cities and direct flights are defined. Each city is represented as an enum type in Z3, and flights are stored as pairs of cities (both directions included).\n2. **Variables**: Variables `x[0]` to `x[20]` represent the city visited on days 1 to 21.\n3. **Flight Constraints**: For each consecutive day, if the city changes, the pair must be in the list of direct flights.\n4. **Total Days Calculation**: For each city, the total days spent are calculated by summing:\n   - Days where the city is the starting point.\n   - Days where the city is the arrival point after a flight.\n5. **Fixed Constraints**: Madrid is enforced on days 20 and 21, and at least one day in Stuttgart is required between days 1 and 4.\n6. **Solver Check**: The Z3 solver checks for a valid itinerary. If found, it prints the day-by-day city visits; otherwise, it reports no solution.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem constraints and leverages the Z3 solver to find a feasible itinerary meeting all requirements."
