Okay, I need to find a time to schedule a meeting between Harold and Patrick for half an hour between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. Harold's calendar is completely open, but Patrick is busy during specific times: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-14:30, and 15:00-16:30. 

First, I should list all the time slots when Patrick is available. Since the workday starts at 9:00 and ends at 17:00, I can break it down into half-hour intervals:

- 9:00-9:30: Patrick is busy
- 9:30-10:00: Available
- 10:00-10:30: Busy
- 10:30-11:00: Available
- 11:00-11:30: Busy
- 11:30-12:00: Available
- 12:00-12:30: Busy
- 12:30-13:00: Available
- 13:00-13:30: Busy
- 13:30-14:00: Available
- 14:00-14:30: Busy
- 14:30-15:00: Available
- 15:00-15:30: Busy
- 15:30-16:00: Available
- 16:00-16:30: Busy
- 16:30-17:00: Available

Now, I need to find a 30-minute slot that fits within Patrick's available times and doesn't overlap with his busy periods. Let me go through each available slot:

1. 9:30-10:00: This is 30 minutes, so that's a possibility.
2. 10:30-11:00: Another 30-minute slot.
3. 11:30-12:00: Another option.
4. 12:30-13:00: Another 30-minute window.
5. 13:30-14:00: Available.
6. 14:30-15:00: Available.
7. 15:30-16:00: Available.
8. 16:30-17:00: The last available slot.

Since the goal is to find the earliest possible time, I should check each available slot in order from earliest to latest. 

Looking at Patrick's schedule, the first available slot after 9:00 is 9:30-10:00. That's a 30-minute window, so Harold can meet him then. There's no earlier slot available for Patrick before that. So, the earliest time that works is 9:30-10:00 on Monday.

Here is the proposed time: Monday, 9:30 - 10:00.
