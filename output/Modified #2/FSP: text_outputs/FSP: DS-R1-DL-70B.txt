Okay, I need to help schedule a meeting for Harold and Patrick on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Harold is free all day, so the only constraints are Patrick's busy times. Patrick is busy during several time slots: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-14:30, and 15:00-16:30. I need to find the earliest 30-minute slot where Patrick is free.

First, let's list Patrick's busy periods in order:

1. 9:00 - 9:30
2. 10:30 - 12:00
3. 12:30 - 13:30
4. 14:00 - 14:30
5. 15:00 - 16:30

Now, I'll look for gaps between these busy times where a 30-minute meeting can fit.

Starting from 9:00, the first busy slot ends at 9:30. So from 9:30 to 10:30, Patrick is free. That's a 1-hour window. The earliest slot here would be 9:30-10:00.

But wait, let me check the next gaps. After 10:30-12:00, the next free time is 12:00-12:30. Then from 13:30 to 14:00, and 14:30-15:00, and finally after 16:30 to 17:00.

Comparing these, the earliest available slot is 9:30-10:00, which is the first possible time after Patrick's initial busy period. So that should be the proposed time.

Here is the proposed time: Monday, 9:30 - 10:00.
