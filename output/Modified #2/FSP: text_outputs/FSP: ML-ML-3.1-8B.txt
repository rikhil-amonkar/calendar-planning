To find a time that works for Harold and Patrick, we need to iterate over the available time slots between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday.

1. Start with the earliest time slot: 9:00 - 9:30 (Patrick is busy, so skip this slot)
2. Next time slot: 9:30 - 10:00 (available, so this is the proposed time)
3. Next time slot: 10:00 - 10:30 (Patrick is busy, so skip this slot)
4. Next time slot: 10:30 - 12:00 (Patrick is busy, so skip this slot)
5. Next time slot: 12:00 - 12:30 (available, but Patrick is busy from 12:30 to 13:30, so skip this slot)
6. Next time slot: 12:30 - 13:30 (Patrick is busy, so skip this slot)
7. Next time slot: 13:30 - 14:00 (available, but Patrick is busy from 14:00 to 14:30, so skip this slot)
8. Next time slot: 14:00 - 14:30 (Patrick is busy, so skip this slot)
9. Next time slot: 14:30 - 15:00 (available, but Patrick is busy from 15:00 to 16:30, so skip this slot)
10. Next time slot: 15:00 - 16:30 (Patrick is busy, so skip this slot)
11. Next time slot: 16:30 - 17:00 (available, so this is the proposed time)

However, we are looking for the earliest available time slot, which is 9:30 - 10:00.

Proposed time: Monday, 9:30 - 10:00.
