**Explanation:**

1. **`find_best_availability` Function:**
   - Takes `harold_schedule` and `patrick_schedule` as input (lists of busy time tuples).
   - Converts time strings to `datetime` objects for easier comparison.
   - Generates a list of all possible 30-minute slots within the workday (9:00 to 17:00).
   - Filters the slots to keep only those that are free for both Harold and Patrick.
   - Returns the first available slot (you could modify this to return the best slot based on other criteria).

2. **Example Usage:**
   - Sets up example schedules for Harold (free all day) and Patrick.
   - Calls the `find_best_availability` function to get the best time slot.
   - Prints the result in a user-friendly format.

**Key Points:**

- **Time Conversion:** The code uses the `datetime` library to convert time strings to `datetime` objects, which allows for easier comparison and manipulation of time intervals.
- **Slot Generation:** It iterates through the workday hours and creates a list of all possible 30-minute slots.
- **Conflict Checking:** It iterates through each available slot and checks if it overlaps with any busy times in either Harold's or Patrick's schedule.
- **Output:** The code prints the best available time slot in the format "HH:MM - HH:MM".
