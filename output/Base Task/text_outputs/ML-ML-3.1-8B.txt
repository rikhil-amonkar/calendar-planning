To find a suitable time for the meeting, we need to look for a half-hour slot where Patrick is not busy. 

Patrick's busy slots are:
- 9:00-9:30
- 10:30-12:00
- 12:30-13:30
- 14:00-14:30
- 15:00-16:30

The available slots for the meeting are:
- 9:30-10:30 (but it's a bit tight since it starts at 9:30)
- 13:30-14:00
- 16:30-17:00

Considering these options, a suitable time for the meeting would be 13:30-14:00, as it is a half-hour slot that works for both Harold and Patrick.
