            "reasoning": "Alright, so the user has given me a task to plan a trip itinerary for visiting 9 European cities over 25 days. They want me to focus only on day ranges and places, without including any transportation details. They've also provided a list of direct flights between these cities. My goal is to create a JSON response that outlines the itinerary in the specified format.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the user's requirements carefully. They want to visit Oslo, Helsinki, Edinburgh, Riga, Tallinn, Budapest, Vilnius, Porto, and Geneva. Each city has a specific number of days allocated, and some have events tied to certain days. For example, they need to attend a wedding in Tallinn between day 4 and 8, and they want to meet a friend in Oslo on days 24 and 25.\n\nNext, I'll look at the direct flights available. This is crucial because the user can only take direct flights between cities. The list includes connections like Porto to Oslo, Edinburgh to Budapest, Edinburgh to Geneva, and so on. I need to ensure that each transition between cities is possible via a direct flight.\n\nI'll start by scheduling the cities with fixed events first. Since the wedding in Tallinn is between day 4 and 8, I'll place Tallinn during that period. Then, I'll work backward and forward from there, ensuring that each city is visited within the allocated days and that the events are appropriately timed.\n\nI'll begin with Edinburgh, as it's a good starting point with multiple connections. From Edinburgh, the user can go to Budapest, which is a 5-day stay. Then, from Budapest, there's a direct flight to Geneva, which fits the 4-day requirement. After Geneva, the next logical step is Porto, which has a direct flight from Geneva and allows for a 5-day stay.\n\nFrom Porto, the user can fly directly to Oslo, which is the final destination where they need to meet a friend on days 24 and 25. Before Oslo, they need to visit Helsinki, which can be reached from Porto via a connecting flight through another city, but since the user specified only direct flights, I need to check if there's a direct flight from Porto to Helsinki. If not, I might need to adjust the itinerary.\n\nWait, looking back, the direct flights list doesn't include a direct flight from Porto to Helsinki, so I need to find an alternative. Perhaps from Geneva to Helsinki, but that would require adjusting the order. Alternatively, maybe from Budapest to Helsinki, but I need to ensure the days align correctly.\n\nI think I need to adjust the itinerary to ensure all flights are direct. Maybe after Geneva, instead of going to Porto, I can go to Helsinki first, then proceed to Porto. But that might disrupt the day allocations. Alternatively, I could place Helsinki earlier in the trip.\n\nLet me try restructuring. Starting in Edinburgh, then to Budapest, then to Helsinki, which has a direct flight from Budapest. From Helsinki, I can go to Riga, which has a direct flight, and then to Tallinn. After Tallinn, I can proceed to Vilnius, then to Porto, Geneva, and finally to Oslo.\n\nThis seems to flow better and ensures that all flights are direct. I'll need to adjust the day ranges accordingly to fit the 25-day total and ensure all events are covered.\n\nSo, the revised itinerary would be:\n\n1. Edinburgh for 3 days (including the event)\n2. Budapest for 5 days\n3. Helsinki for 2 days\n4. Riga for 2 days\n5. Tallinn for 5 days (including the wedding)\n6. Vilnius for 5 days\n7. Porto for 5 days\n8. Geneva for 4 days\n9. Oslo for 2 days (including meeting a friend)\n\nI'll need to ensure that each transition is via a direct flight and that the days add up correctly without exceeding the 25-day limit. I'll also need to check that each city's stay duration matches the user's request.\n\nFinally, I'll format this into the required JSON structure, making sure to only include the day ranges and city names without any additional text or explanations.\n</think>",
