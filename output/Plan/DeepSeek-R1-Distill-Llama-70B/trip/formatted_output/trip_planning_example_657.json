They want to spend 4 days in Frankfurt, with a conference there from day 13 to 16. They also want to visit Manchester for 4 days, Valencia for 4 days, Naples for 4 days, Oslo for 3 days, and Vilnius for 2 days, where they're attending a wedding on days 12-13.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the order of the cities based on the direct flights available. The user provided the direct flight connections, so I should use those to ensure smooth transitions without backtracking too much.\n\nStarting with Vilnius since the wedding is there on days 12-13, it makes sense to place that towards the end. So maybe after visiting a few cities, they can go to Vilnius, then proceed to Frankfurt for the conference.\n\nLooking at the flights, Vilnius connects to Frankfurt directly, which is perfect. So after Vilnius, Frankfurt would be next. That way, they can attend the wedding and then head to Frankfurt for the conference.\n\nNow, before Vilnius, where should they go? They need to reach Vilnius from another city with a direct flight. Oslo connects to Vilnius, so maybe they can go to Oslo before Vilnius. That makes sense because Oslo is another destination they want to visit.\n\nBefore Oslo, they could go to Naples since Naples connects to Oslo. Naples is another city they want to visit for 4 days, so placing that before Oslo would work.\n\nNow, how to get to Naples? They have Valencia and Manchester connecting to Naples. If they go to Manchester first, they can then go to Naples. Manchester connects to Naples directly, so that's a good route.\n\nValencia is another city they want to visit. Since Valencia connects to Frankfurt, maybe they can start with Valencia, then go to Manchester, then Naples, Oslo, Vilnius, and finally Frankfurt.\n\nSo the order would be:\n1. Valencia (4 days)\n2. Manchester (4 days)\n3. Naples (4 days)\n4. Oslo (3 days)\n5. Vilnius (2 days)\n6. Frankfurt (4 days)\n\nLet me check the days:\n- Valencia: Day 1-4\n- Manchester: Day 5-8\n- Naples: Day 9-12\n- Oslo: Day 13-15\n- Vilnius: Day 16-17\n- Frankfurt: Day 18-21\n\nWait, that's 21 days, but the user only has 16 days. I must have miscalculated.\n\nLet me adjust. They need to cover all six cities in 16 days, so each city's stay duration should fit within that.\n\nValencia: 4 days\nManchester: 4 days\nNaples: 4 days\nOslo: 3 days\nVilnius: 2 days\nFrankfurt: 4 days\n\nTotal days: 4+4+4+3+2+4=21 days. That's over the 16-day limit. So I need to adjust the durations.\n\nPerhaps they can't stay the full duration in each city. Maybe reduce some stays.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, and the durations should be adjusted to fit 16 days. Let me try to fit the cities within 16 days.\n\nPerhaps:\n- Valencia: 4 days\n- Manchester: 4 days\n- Naples: 4 days\n- Oslo: 2 days\n- Vilnius: 1 day\n- Frankfurt: 1 day\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. Maybe the user intended to have shorter stays. Alternatively, perhaps the wedding in Vilnius is only 1 day, and Frankfurt's conference is 4 days, so:\n\n- Valencia: 4 days\n- Manchester: 4 days\n- Naples: 4 days\n- Oslo: 2 days\n- Vilnius: 1 day\n- Frankfurt: 4 days\n\nBut that still exceeds 16 days. I'm confused. Maybe the user wants to spend 4 days in Frankfurt, with the conference on days 13-16, so Frankfurt must be the last destination.\n\nLet me start with Valencia on days 1-4, then Manchester days 5-8, Naples days 9-12, Oslo days 13-15, Vilnius day 16, and Frankfurt days 17-20. But that's 20 days, and the user wants 16 days.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the user's request. They might have intended shorter stays. To fit 16 days, perhaps:\n\n- Valencia: 3 days\n- Manchester: 3 days\n- Naples: 3 days\n- Oslo: 2 days\n- Vilnius: 2 days\n- Frankfurt: 3 days\n\nTotal: 3+3+3+2+2+3=16 days.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n- Valencia: Day 1-3\n- Manchester: Day 4-6\n- Naples: Day 7-9\n- Oslo: Day 10-11\n- Vilnius: Day 12-13\n- Frankfurt: Day 14-16\n\nBut the user specified durations like 4 days for Frankfurt and 4 for others. I think the user might have made an error in the total days. I'll proceed with the initial plan, adjusting the durations to fit 16 days.\n</think>",
