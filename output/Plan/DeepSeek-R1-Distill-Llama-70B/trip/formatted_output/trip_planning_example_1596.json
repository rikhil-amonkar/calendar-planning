They want to visit Bucharest, Krakow, Munich, Barcelona, Warsaw, Budapest, Stockholm, Riga, Edinburgh, and Vienna. Each city has specific day ranges and events, and they can only take direct flights between cities.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the cities and their required stays and events:\n\n1. **Bucharest**: 2 days\n2. **Krakow**: 4 days\n3. **Munich**: 3 days (workshop days 18-20)\n4. **Barcelona**: 5 days\n5. **Warsaw**: 5 days (conference days 25-29)\n6. **Budapest**: 5 days (annual show days 9-13)\n7. **Stockholm**: 2 days (meet friends days 17-18)\n8. **Riga**: 5 days\n9. **Edinburgh**: 5 days (meet friend days 1-5)\n10. **Vienna**: 5 days\n\nNext, I'll consider the direct flight connections provided. I need to ensure that each city is reachable from the previous one via a direct flight. \n\nI'll start with Edinburgh since the user wants to meet a friend there between days 1-5. From Edinburgh, there are direct flights to Stockholm, Krakow, Budapest, and Munich. Since Stockholm is a shorter stay and the meeting with friends is on days 17-18, it makes sense to go to Stockholm next. \n\nFrom Stockholm, there are direct flights to Krakow and Munich. Since Krakow is a 4-day stay, I'll go there next. After Krakow, the next logical city is Munich, which has a workshop and is connected by a direct flight from Krakow.\n\nMunich is followed by Barcelona, as there's a direct flight and Barcelona is a 5-day stay. From Barcelona, the next city should be connected by a direct flight. Budapest is a good option with a direct flight from Barcelona and it's a 5-day stay with an annual show. \n\nFrom Budapest, Vienna is a logical next step with a direct flight and a 5-day stay. Vienna is connected to many other cities, so it's a good hub. After Vienna, Riga is next with a direct flight and a 5-day stay. From Riga, Warsaw is connected with a direct flight and is necessary for the conference. Finally, from Warsaw, there's a direct flight back to Bucharest, which is the last city.\n\nI need to ensure the days add up correctly and that each city's specific events fall within the correct day ranges. Adjusting the days to fit all stays and events without overlap is crucial.\n</think>",
