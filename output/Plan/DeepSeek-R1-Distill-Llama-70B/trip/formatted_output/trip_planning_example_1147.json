They also want to visit Helsinki for 3 days, Split for 4 days, Dubrovnik for 2 days, Istanbul for 5 days with a show from day 1 to 5, Milan for 4 days, Vilnius for 5 days with a workshop from day 18 to 22, and Frankfurt for 3 days with a wedding from day 16 to 18.\n\nI need to ensure the itinerary connects these cities with direct flights. Starting with Istanbul makes sense since the annual show is from day 1 to 5. After Istanbul, moving to Brussels, which has direct flights to many cities, seems logical. From Brussels, heading to Milan, which is a hub with many connections, would be next. Then, moving on to Split, which is a popular destination and has direct flights to other cities on the list.\n\nAfter Split, Dubrovnik is a short flight away, and from there, heading to Frankfurt for the wedding makes sense. Then, moving to Helsinki, which connects well to other cities, and finally ending in Vilnius for the workshop. Each city is chosen based on the user's desired stay duration and event timings, ensuring smooth transitions with direct flights.\n</think>",
