            "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to help plan a trip itinerary for someone visiting 3 European cities over 10 days. The cities are Krakow, Dubrovnik, and Frankfurt. The user has specified that they want to spend 2 days in Krakow, attend a wedding there on days 9 and 10, stay in Dubrovnik for 7 days, and visit Frankfurt for 3 days. They also provided direct flight connections between these cities.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the order of the cities based on the direct flights available. The user mentioned that there are direct flights from Frankfurt to Krakow and from Dubrovnik to Frankfurt. That means I can go from Dubrovnik to Frankfurt and then from Frankfurt to Krakow, but not directly from Dubrovnik to Krakow.\n\nThe user wants to attend a wedding in Krakow on days 9 and 10, so Krakow should be the last destination. That way, they can attend the wedding at the end of their trip without having to travel again afterward.\n\nSo, the trip should start in Dubrovnik, where they'll spend the first 7 days. Then, they'll fly to Frankfurt and spend 3 days there. Finally, they'll go to Krakow for the last 2 days to attend the wedding.\n\nI need to make sure the day ranges don't overlap and add up correctly. Let's break it down:\n\n- Dubrovnik: Days 1-7 (7 days)\n- Frankfurt: Days 8-10 (3 days)\n- Krakow: Days 11-12 (2 days)\n\nWait, but the user wants to attend the wedding in Krakow on days 9 and 10. If I follow the above plan, Krakow would be days 11-12, which doesn't align with the wedding dates. So I need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps they should go to Krakow earlier. Let me try:\n\n- Dubrovnik: Days 1-7 (7 days)\n- Krakow: Days 8-9 (2 days) for the wedding\n- Frankfurt: Days 10-12 (3 days)\n\nBut the user wants to spend 3 days in Frankfurt, so days 10-12 would be ideal. However, the wedding is on days 9 and 10, so Krakow should cover those days.\n\nWait, maybe the trip should be:\n\n- Dubrovnik: Days 1-7\n- Frankfurt: Days 8-10 (3 days)\n- Krakow: Days 11-12 (2 days)\n\nBut the wedding is on days 9 and 10, which would fall during the stay in Frankfurt. That doesn't work. So perhaps the order needs to be adjusted.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- Start in Frankfurt for 3 days (Days 1-3)\n- Then go to Dubrovnik for 7 days (Days 4-10)\n- Finally, go to Krakow for 2 days (Days 11-12)\n\nBut the wedding is on days 9 and 10, which would be while they're in Dubrovnik. That's not possible. So the wedding must be in Krakow on days 9 and 10, meaning Krakow should be visited around those days.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n- Dubrovnik: Days 1-7\n- Krakow: Days 8-9 (2 days, including the wedding on days 9 and 10? Wait, days 8-9 are only 2 days, but the wedding is on days 9 and 10. So maybe:\n\n- Dubrovnik: Days 1-7\n- Krakow: Days 8-10 (3 days, with the wedding on days 9 and 10)\n- Frankfurt: Days 11-13 (3 days)\n\nBut the total trip is 10 days, so Days 11-13 would exceed that. Hmm.\n\nWait, the total trip is 10 days. So:\n\n- Dubrovnik: Days 1-7 (7 days)\n- Krakow: Days 8-10 (3 days, with the wedding on days 9 and 10)\n- Frankfurt: Can't fit because that would require 3 more days, making it 13 days total.\n\nThis is conflicting. The user wants to spend 3 days in Frankfurt, 7 in Dubrovnik, and 2 in Krakow, totaling 12 days, but the trip is for 10 days. There might be a mistake in the user's request.\n\nAssuming the total is 10 days, perhaps:\n\n- Dubrovnik: Days 1-7\n- Krakow: Days 8-9 (2 days, wedding on day 9)\n- Frankfurt: Days 10-12 (3 days)\n\nBut this exceeds 10 days. Alternatively, adjust the days:\n\n- Dubrovnik: Days 1-7\n- Krakow: Days 8-9\n- Frankfurt: Days 10\n\nBut that's only 1 day in Frankfurt, which doesn't meet the 3-day requirement.\n\nMaybe the user intended the trip to be 12 days. If so, the itinerary would be:\n\n- Dubrovnik: 1-7\n- Krakow: 8-10 (3 days, with the wedding on 9-10)\n- Frankfurt: 11-13 (3 days)\n\nBut the user specified 10 days. This is confusing. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the total days. Assuming it's 12 days, the itinerary works as above. If it's strictly 10 days, then perhaps they can't visit all three cities as intended.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll proceed with the 12-day itinerary, assuming the user made a typo.\n</think>",
