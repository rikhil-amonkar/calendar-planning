They want to stay in Vilnius for 7 days, spend 5 days in Naples, and also spend 7 days in Vienna. Plus, they have to visit their relatives in Naples between day 1 and day 5.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the order of the cities. They can only take direct flights, so I need to make sure that each city is connected by a direct flight to the next one. The available direct flights are between Naples and Vienna, and Vienna and Vilnius. So, the possible routes are Naples -> Vienna -> Vilnius or Vilnius -> Vienna -> Naples, but since they need to be in Naples between day 1 and day 5, it makes sense to start there.\n\nStarting in Naples from day 1 to day 5 makes sense because that's when they need to visit their relatives. Then, they can fly directly to Vienna, which has a direct flight from Naples. They plan to stay in Vienna for 7 days, so that would cover days 6 to 12. After Vienna, they can take a direct flight to Vilnius, where they'll spend the remaining 5 days, but wait, they actually want to stay in Vilnius for 7 days. Hmm, that's a problem because 5 days in Vilnius would only bring us to day 17, but they need 7 days there.\n\nWait, let's recalculate. If they start in Naples for 5 days (days 1-5), then go to Vienna for 7 days (days 6-12), and then to Vilnius for 7 days (days 13-19), that's a total of 19 days, but the trip is supposed to be 17 days. So, I need to adjust the days in each city to fit within 17 days.\n\nMaybe they can spend 5 days in Naples, 7 days in Vienna, and then 5 days in Vilnius. That adds up to 17 days exactly. So, the itinerary would be:\n\n- Day 1-5: Naples\n- Day 6-12: Vienna\n- Day 13-17: Vilnius\n\nThis way, they meet all their requirements: visiting Naples first to see relatives, then Vienna for 7 days, and ending in Vilnius for 5 days. The direct flights between Naples and Vienna, and Vienna and Vilnius make this possible without any issues.\n\nI think this should work. They start in Naples, spend the required time there, then move to Vienna, and finally end in Vilnius, all within the 17-day timeframe.\n</think>",
