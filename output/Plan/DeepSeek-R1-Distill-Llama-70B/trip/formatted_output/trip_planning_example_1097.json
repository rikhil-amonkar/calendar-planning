            "reasoning": "Alright, let's tackle this trip planning problem. So, the user wants to visit 8 European cities over 18 days, using only direct flights. They've provided specific durations for each city and some constraints on when certain events happen. My goal is to create a feasible itinerary that meets all these requirements.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the cities and the number of days they want to spend in each:\n\n- Reykjavik: 4 days\n- Riga: 2 days (with a meeting between Day 4 and Day 5)\n- Oslo: 3 days\n- Lyon: 5 days\n- Dubrovnik: 2 days (wedding between Day 7 and Day 8)\n- Madrid: 2 days\n- Warsaw: 4 days\n- London: 3 days\n\nNext, I'll note the direct flight connections provided:\n\n1. Warsaw \u2194 Reykjavik\n2. Oslo \u2194 Madrid\n3. Warsaw \u2194 Riga\n4. Lyon \u2194 London\n5. Madrid \u2194 London\n6. Warsaw \u2194 London\n7. Reykjavik \u2192 Madrid\n8. Warsaw \u2194 Oslo\n9. Oslo \u2194 Dubrovnik\n10. Oslo \u2194 Reykjavik\n11. Riga \u2194 Oslo\n12. Oslo \u2194 Lyon\n13. Oslo \u2194 London\n14. London \u2194 Reykjavik\n15. Warsaw \u2194 Madrid\n16. Madrid \u2194 Lyon\n17. Dubrovnik \u2194 Madrid\n\nNow, I'll start by identifying the constraints that anchor specific days:\n\n1. The wedding in Dubrovnik must be between Day 7 and Day 8. So, Dubrovnik needs to be scheduled around those days.\n2. The meeting in Riga must be between Day 4 and Day 5. So, Riga should be scheduled around those days.\n\nGiven that, I'll start by placing Dubrovnik on Days 7-8. Since Dubrovnik has a direct flight from Oslo, I'll need to ensure that the previous city is Oslo or another city with a direct flight to Dubrovnik. Looking at the connections, Dubrovnik connects to Oslo and Madrid. Since the user wants to spend 3 days in Oslo, I'll schedule Oslo before Dubrovnik.\n\nSo, tentatively:\n\n- Oslo: Days 5-7\n- Dubrovnik: Days 7-8\n\nBut wait, the wedding is on Days 7-8, so Dubrovnik should cover those days. That means arriving in Dubrovnik by Day 7.\n\nNext, the meeting in Riga is on Days 4-5. So, Riga needs to be on Days 4-5. Since Riga connects to Warsaw and Oslo, I'll need to place Riga after one of those cities.\n\nLet's consider starting in Reykjavik, as it's a major hub and has multiple connections. So:\n\n- Reykjavik: Days 1-4\n\nFrom Reykjavik, there are direct flights to Warsaw, Oslo, and London. Since Riga is next, and Riga connects to Warsaw, perhaps going from Reykjavik to Warsaw, then to Riga.\n\nSo:\n\n- Reykjavik: Days 1-4\n- Warsaw: Days 5-8 (but need to adjust because Riga needs to be on Days 4-5)\n\nWait, that's a conflict. If Riga is Days 4-5, and Reykjavik is Days 1-4, that would mean leaving Reykjavik on Day 4 to arrive in Riga on Day 4. That might be tight, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting in Warsaw:\n\n- Warsaw: Days 1-4\n- Riga: Days 5-6\n\nBut the user wants to spend 4 days in Warsaw, so that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting in Reykjavik:\n\n- Reykjavik: Days 1-4\n- Fly to Riga on Day 4, arriving on Day 5\n- Riga: Days 5-6 (meeting on Days 4-5, but that would require arriving on Day 4)\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe adjust the start:\n\n- Reykjavik: Days 1-4\n- Fly to Riga on Day 4, arriving on Day 5\n- Riga: Days 5-6 (meeting on Days 4-5, but since arrival is Day 5, the meeting would be on Day 5)\n\nThat might work.\n\nThen, from Riga, direct flights to Oslo. So:\n\n- Oslo: Days 7-9\n\nBut Dubrovnik needs to be on Days 7-8. So, perhaps:\n\n- Oslo: Days 5-7\n- Dubrovnik: Days 7-8\n\nBut that would mean overlapping days, which isn't possible. Maybe adjust Oslo to Days 6-8, with Dubrovnik on Days 7-8. That way, Oslo is Days 6-8, and Dubrovnik is Days 7-8. But that would mean overlapping days in Oslo and Dubrovnik, which isn't feasible unless the user can be in two places at once.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\n- Reykjavik: Days 1-4\n- Riga: Days 5-6\n- Oslo: Days 7-9\n- Dubrovnik: Days 10-11\n\nBut the wedding is supposed to be on Days 7-8, so this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe adjust the order:\n\n- Start in Warsaw: Days 1-4\n- Riga: Days 5-6\n- Oslo: Days 7-9\n- Dubrovnik: Days 10-11\n\nBut then the wedding is on Days 7-8, which would be in Oslo, but the wedding is supposed to be in Dubrovnik.\n\nWait, the wedding is in Dubrovnik, so Dubrovnik must be on Days 7-8. So, perhaps:\n\n- Reykjavik: Days 1-4\n- Fly to Oslo on Day 4, arriving on Day 5\n- Oslo: Days 5-7\n- Fly to Dubrovnik on Day 7, arriving on Day 8\n- Dubrovnik: Days 8-9\n\nBut the wedding is on Days 7-8, so this would miss the wedding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\n- Reykjavik: Days 1-4\n- Fly to Dubrovnik on Day 4, arriving on Day 5\n- Dubrovnik: Days 5-6 (but the wedding is on Days 7-8)\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the user needs to adjust their constraints, but since I have to work with the given data, I'll try to find a way.\n\nPerhaps starting in Oslo:\n\n- Oslo: Days 1-3\n- Fly to Reykjavik on Day 3, arriving on Day 4\n- Reykjavik: Days 4-7\n- Fly to Riga on Day 7, arriving on Day 8\n- Riga: Days 8-9\n- Fly to Warsaw on Day 9, arriving on Day 10\n- Warsaw: Days 10-13\n- Fly to Lyon on Day 13, arriving on Day 14\n- Lyon: Days 14-18\n- Fly to Madrid on Day 18, arriving on Day 19\n- Madrid: Days 19-20\n- Fly to London on Day 20, arriving on Day 21\n- London: Days 21-23\n\nBut this exceeds the 18-day limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\n- Reykjavik: Days 1-4\n- Fly to Riga on Day 4, arriving on Day 5\n- Riga: Days 5-6\n- Fly to Oslo on Day 6, arriving on Day 7\n- Oslo: Days 7-9\n- Fly to Dubrovnik on Day 9, arriving on Day 10\n- Dubrovnik: Days 10-11\n- Fly to Madrid on Day 11, arriving on Day 12\n- Madrid: Days 12-13\n- Fly to London on Day 13, arriving on Day 14\n- London: Days 14-16\n- Fly to Lyon on Day 16, arriving on Day 17\n- Lyon: Days 17-21\n- Fly to Warsaw on Day 21, arriving on Day 22\n- Warsaw: Days 22-25\n\nThis also exceeds the 18-day limit.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to fit everything within 18 days, focusing on the constraints:\n\n1. Dubrovnik must be on Days 7-8.\n2. Riga must be on Days 4-5.\n\nSo:\n\n- Days 1-4: Reykjavik\n- Days 5-6: Riga\n- Days 7-8: Dubrovnik\n- Days 9-11: Oslo (3 days)\n- Days 12-16: Lyon (5 days)\n- Days 17-18: Madrid (2 days)\n\nBut that leaves out Warsaw and London. So, perhaps:\n\n- Days 1-4: Reykjavik\n- Days 5-6: Riga\n- Days 7-8: Dubrovnik\n- Days 9-11: Oslo\n- Days 12-16: Lyon\n- Days 17-18: Madrid\n- Days 19-21: Warsaw (4 days)\n- Days 22-24: London (3 days)\n\nBut this exceeds 18 days.\n\nWait, the total days are 18, so I need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n- Days 1-4: Reykjavik\n- Days 5-6: Riga\n- Days 7-8: Dubrovnik\n- Days 9-11: Oslo\n- Days 12-16: Lyon\n- Days 17-18: Madrid\n\nThis covers 18 days but misses Warsaw and London.\n\nAlternatively, maybe reduce the days in some cities, but the user specified exact durations.\n\nPerhaps the user made a mistake in the total days. Alternatively, I'll have to adjust the itinerary to fit within 18 days, possibly overlapping some stays, which isn't ideal.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll prioritize the events:\n\n- Reykjavik: 4 days\n- Riga: 2 days (Days 4-5)\n- Dubrovnik: 2 days (Days 7-8)\n- Oslo: 3 days\n- Lyon: 5 days\n- Madrid: 2 days\n- Warsaw: 4 days\n- London: 3 days\n\nTotal days: 4+2+2+3+5+2+4+3 = 25 days, but the user wants it in 18 days. There's a discrepancy here. It seems impossible to fit all these durations within 18 days without overlapping.\n\nPerhaps the user intended fewer days in some cities. Alternatively, I'll have to make some adjustments, possibly reducing the days in some cities to make it fit.\n\nGiven that, I'll create an itinerary that fits within 18 days, adjusting the durations where necessary.\n</think>",
