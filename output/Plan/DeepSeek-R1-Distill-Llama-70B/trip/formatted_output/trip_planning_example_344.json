However, the total days add up to 23, which is more than the 20 days available. This means I need to adjust the durations to fit within the 20-day window without overlapping.\n\nLooking at the constraints:\n- The user must visit relatives in Athens between Day 1 and Day 6. So, Athens should be scheduled first, from Day 1 to Day 6.\n- There's a wedding in Naples between Day 16 and Day 20, so Naples needs to be scheduled during those days.\n- The user wants to spend 6 days in Valencia and 6 days in Zurich, but given the time constraints, I might need to reduce these slightly.\n\nGiven the direct flights:\n- Valencia connects to Naples, Athens, and Zurich.\n- Athens connects to Naples and Zurich.\n- Zurich connects to Naples and Valencia.\n\nStarting with Athens from Day 1 to Day 6 makes sense. After that, moving to Valencia would be logical since there's a direct flight. Valencia can be from Day 7 to Day 12 (6 days).
