            "reasoning": "Alright, let's tackle this trip planning problem. The user wants to visit 6 European cities over 13 days, with specific day ranges for certain activities. They can only take direct flights between cities. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the cities and their required stays:\n- Dublin: 3 days, with friends from day 7 to 9.\n- Madrid: 2 days, visiting relatives between day 2 and 3.\n- Oslo: 3 days.\n- London: 2 days.\n- Vilnius: 3 days.\n- Berlin: 5 days, with a wedding from day 3 to 7.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that the cities are visited in an order that respects the direct flight connections provided. The cities and their direct flights are:\n- London <-> Madrid\n- Oslo <-> Vilnius\n- Berlin <-> Vilnius\n- Madrid <-> Oslo\n- Madrid <-> Dublin\n- London <-> Oslo\n- Madrid <-> Berlin\n- Berlin <-> Oslo\n- Dublin <-> Oslo\n- London <-> Dublin\n- London <-> Berlin\n- Berlin <-> Dublin\n\nI'll start by placing the cities with fixed date requirements. The wedding in Berlin is from day 3 to 7, so Berlin should be placed around those days. Visiting relatives in Madrid between day 2 and 3 suggests Madrid should come early.\n\nI'll draft a possible itinerary:\n1. Start in London for 2 days (days 1-2).\n2. Fly to Madrid for 2 days (days 3-4), overlapping with the relatives' visit.\n3. Then go to Berlin for 5 days (days 5-9), covering the wedding and allowing flexibility.\n4. Next, visit Dublin for 3 days (days 10-12), aligning with meeting friends from day 7-9, but this might need adjustment.\n5. Proceed to Oslo for 3 days (days 13-15).\n6. Then Vilnius for 3 days (days 16-18).\n\nHowever, the total days exceed 13, so I need to adjust. Let me try another approach:\n\n1. Start in Berlin for 5 days (days 1-5), covering the wedding from day 3-7.\n2. Fly to Madrid for 2 days (days 6-7), visiting relatives.\n3. Then to London for 2 days (days 8-9).\n4. Proceed to Dublin for 3 days (days 10-12), meeting friends.\n5. Next, Oslo for 3 days (days 13-15).\n6. Finally, Vilnius for 3 days (days 16-18).\n\nBut this still exceeds 13 days. I realize I need to fit all cities within 13 days, so I'll adjust the stays:\n\n1. Berlin: 5 days (days 1-5)\n2. Madrid: 2 days (days 6-7)\n3. London: 2 days (days 8-9)\n4. Dublin: 3 days (days 10-12)\n5. Oslo: 3 days (days 13-15)\n6. Vilnius: 3 days (days 16-18)\n\nThis still goes over, so I'll shorten some stays or adjust the order. Maybe reduce Vilnius to 2 days:\n\n1. Berlin: 5 (1-5)\n2. Madrid: 2 (6-7)\n3. London: 2 (8-9)\n4. Dublin: 3 (10-12)\n5. Oslo: 3 (13-15)\n6. Vilnius: 1 (16)\n\nNow, total days: 16, still over. Perhaps overlap some stays or adjust the order to minimize travel days. Alternatively, start with Madrid:\n\n1. Madrid: 2 (1-2)\n2. Berlin: 5 (3-7)\n3. London: 2 (8-9)\n4. Dublin: 3 (10-12)\n5. Oslo: 3 (13-15)\n6. Vilnius: 3 (16-18)\n\nStill over. Maybe reduce Vilnius to 1 day:\n\n1. Madrid: 2 (1-2)\n2. Berlin: 5 (3-7)\n3. London: 2 (8-9)\n4. Dublin: 3 (10-12)\n5. Oslo: 3 (13-15)\n6. Vilnius: 1 (16)\n\nTotal: 16 days. Still need to cut one more day. Perhaps adjust Berlin to 4 days:\n\n1. Madrid: 2 (1-2)\n2. Berlin: 4 (3-6)\n3. London: 2 (7-8)\n4. Dublin: 3 (9-11)\n5. Oslo: 3 (12-14)\n6. Vilnius: 3 (15-17)\n\nNow, total is 17 days. Still over. Maybe combine some stays or adjust further. Alternatively, prioritize the fixed events:\n\n- Berlin: days 3-7 (5 days)\n- Madrid: days 2-3 (2 days)\n- Dublin: days 7-9 (3 days)\n\nAdjusting the itinerary to fit these:\n\n1. Berlin: days 1-5\n2. Madrid: days 6-7\n3. Dublin: days 8-10\n4. London: days 11-12\n5. Oslo: days 13-15\n6. Vilnius: days 16-18\n\nStill 18 days. It's challenging to fit all within 13 days without overlapping or reducing stays further. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the total days or city stays. I'll proceed with the closest fit, ensuring fixed events are covered.\n</think>",
