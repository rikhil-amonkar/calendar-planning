My task is to create an itinerary that meets all these constraints using direct flights between the cities provided.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the cities and their required stays:\n- Warsaw: 4 days\n- Venice: 3 days\n- Vilnius: 3 days\n- Salzburg: 4 days (with a wedding from day 22-25)\n- Amsterdam: 2 days\n- Barcelona: 5 days (meeting friends between day 2-6)\n- Paris: 2 days (workshop on day 1-2)\n- Hamburg: 4 days (conference on day 19-22)\n- Florence: 5 days\n- Tallinn: 2 days (meeting a friend on day 11-12)\n\nNext, I'll note the direct flights available between these cities. It's crucial to ensure each transition is possible with a direct flight.\n\nStarting with Paris since there's a workshop on day 1-2. From Paris, I can go to Venice, which is a 3-day stay. After Venice, I'll need a city that connects to both Venice and allows progression towards other destinations. Amsterdam seems like a good next step as it connects to Venice and offers a 2-day stay.\n\nFrom Amsterdam, moving to Warsaw makes sense because there's a direct flight, and Warsaw needs a 4-day stay. After Warsaw, Vilnius is reachable and requires a 3-day visit. Following Vilnius, Tallinn is a direct flight and fits the 2-day requirement, aligning with the friend meeting on day 11-12.\n\nPost-Tallinn, Barcelona is a logical next step, especially since there's a direct flight and it's a 5-day stay where friends will be met between day 2-6. However, considering the timeline, adjusting the stay in Barcelona to fit the meeting window is essential.\n\nAfter Barcelona, heading to Florence is possible with a direct flight, and it's a 5-day stay. From Florence, moving to Hamburg is feasible, and it's a 4-day stay with a conference from day 19-22. Finally, ending in Salzburg for the wedding on day 22-25 requires a direct flight from Hamburg.\n\nI need to ensure the day ranges don't overlap and each city's stay is met. Adjusting the itinerary to fit all these requirements without exceeding the 25-day limit is the final step.\n</think>",
