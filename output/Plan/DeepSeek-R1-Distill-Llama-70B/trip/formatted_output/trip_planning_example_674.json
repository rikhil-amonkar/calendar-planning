The user has specified the cities and the number of days to spend in each, along with some specific day ranges for events. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the cities and the number of days to stay in each:\n- Helsinki: 2 days (with a workshop on days 1-2)\n- Warsaw: 3 days (visiting relatives between days 9-11)\n- Madrid: 4 days\n- Split: 4 days\n- Reykjavik: 2 days (meeting a friend between days 8-9)\n- Budapest: 4 days\n\nNext, I need to consider the direct flight connections provided:\n- Helsinki and Reykjavik\n- Budapest and Warsaw\n- Madrid and Split\n- Helsinki and Split\n- Helsinki and Madrid\n- Helsinki and Budapest\n- Reykjavik and Warsaw\n- Helsinki and Warsaw\n- Madrid and Budapest\n- Budapest and Reykjavik\n- Madrid and Warsaw\n- Warsaw and Split\n- Reykjavik to Madrid\n\nNow, I'll start mapping out the itinerary, ensuring that the events and day ranges are respected.\n\n1. Start in Helsinki for the first 2 days since the workshop is on days 1-2.\n2. From Helsinki, there are direct flights to Split, Madrid, Budapest, and Reykjavik. Since the next destination is Warsaw, but there's a direct flight from Helsinki to Warsaw, I can go there next. However, the user wants to visit Warsaw between days 9-11, so I need to plan accordingly.\n3. After Helsinki, I can go to Split, as there's a direct flight. Spend 4 days in Split (days 3-6).\n4. From Split, the next logical destination is Madrid, as there's a direct flight. Spend 4 days in Madrid (days 7-10).\n5. Madrid to Warsaw is a direct flight. However, the user wants to be in Warsaw between days 9-11, but according to the current plan, arriving on day 7-10 in Madrid and then going to Warsaw would overlap. So, perhaps I should adjust the order.\n6. Let me reconsider. After Helsinki, go to Reykjavik for 2 days (days 3-4) to meet the friend. Then from Reykjavik, fly to Madrid (direct flight) for 4 days (days 5-8).\n7. From Madrid, fly to Split (direct flight) for 4 days (days 9-12). But the user wants to be in Warsaw between days 9-11, so this might not align.\n8. Maybe after Helsinki, go to Budapest first, spend 4 days (days 3-6), then to Warsaw (direct flight) for days 7-9, which fits the user's requirement. From Warsaw, go to Split for 4 days (days 10-13), then to Madrid for 4 days (days 14-17), and finally to Reykjavik for 2 days (days 18-19). But the total days exceed 14, so this isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, I need to adjust to fit within 14 days. Let me try another approach.\n\n1. Start in Helsinki (days 1-2).\n2. Fly to Reykjavik (days 3-4) to meet the friend.\n3. From Reykjavik, fly to Madrid (days 5-8).\n4. Madrid to Split (days 9-12).\n5. Split to Warsaw (direct flight) for days 13-14, but the user wants to be in Warsaw between days 9-11, so this doesn't align.\n\nPerhaps I need to prioritize Warsaw's timing. Let's try:\n\n1. Helsinki (days 1-2).\n2. Fly to Warsaw (days 3-5) but the user wants to be there days 9-11, so maybe not.\n3. Alternatively, go from Helsinki to Split (days 3-6), then Split to Madrid (days 7-10), Madrid to Warsaw (days 11-13), and Warsaw to Budapest (days 14-17). But again, days exceed.\n\nWait, the user wants to spend 4 days in Madrid, 4 in Split, 3 in Warsaw, 4 in Budapest, 2 in Helsinki, and 2 in Reykjavik, totaling 19 days, but the trip is only 14 days. There's a discrepancy here. I think the user made a mistake in the total days. I'll proceed with the given total of 14 days, adjusting the stays accordingly.\n\nFinal plan:\n1. Helsinki (days 1-2).\n2. Reykjavik (days 3-4).\n3. Madrid (days 5-8).\n4. Split (days 9-12).\n5. Warsaw (days 13-14).\n\nBut this misses Budapest. Since the user wants to visit Budapest for 4 days, I'll need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps:\n1. Helsinki (days 1-2).\n2. Budapest (days 3-6).\n3. Warsaw (days 7-9).\n4. Split (days 10-13).\n5. Madrid (days 14-17) but this exceeds 14 days.\n\nI think the user intended the total to be 17 days, but I'll proceed with the given 14, focusing on the key cities and events.\n</think>",
