The user has specified how many days they want to spend in each city and some specific day ranges for events like weddings, meeting friends, etc. My task is to map out an itinerary that fits all these constraints.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the cities and the number of days to be spent in each:\n\n- Santorini: 5 days (days 25-29)\n- Krakow: 5 days (days 18-22)\n- Paris: 5 days (days 11-15)\n- Vilnius: 3 days\n- Munich: 5 days\n- Geneva: 2 days\n- Amsterdam: 4 days\n- Budapest: 5 days\n- Split: 4 days\n\nNow, I need to ensure that the trip starts in one city and moves logically to the next, using only direct flights as specified. The user provided a list of direct flights between these cities, so I need to make sure each transition is possible.\n\nStarting with Paris makes sense because it's a major hub with many direct flights. The user wants to spend days 11-15 in Paris, so I'll place Paris after some initial cities. Maybe start with Vilnius, then move to Munich, then to Paris.\n\nFrom Paris, moving to Amsterdam is logical since there's a direct flight. Amsterdam is next, and the user wants to spend 4 days there.\n\nAfter Amsterdam, moving to Budapest fits because there's a direct flight, and Budapest is another major city with good connections.\n\nFrom Budapest, moving to Krakow makes sense, especially since there's a direct flight and the user needs to be in Krakow from day 18-22.\n\nAfter Krakow, moving to Split is possible with a direct flight, and Split is where the user wants to spend 4 days.\n\nFrom Split, moving to Santorini is necessary because Santorini is the final destination where the user wants to meet friends from day 25-29.\n\nBut wait, I also need to fit in Geneva somewhere. Geneva is only 2 days, so perhaps after Split, before Santorini. There's a direct flight from Split to Geneva, and then from Geneva to Santorini.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1. Start in Vilnius for 3 days.\n2. Fly to Munich for 5 days.\n3. Fly to Paris for 5 days (days 11-15).\n4. Fly to Amsterdam for 4 days.\n5. Fly to Budapest for 5 days.\n6. Fly to Krakow for 5 days (days 18-22).\n7. Fly to Split for 4 days.\n8. Fly to Geneva for 2 days.\n9. Finally, fly to Santorini for 5 days (days 25-29).\n\nThis seems to cover all cities within the 30-day period, respecting the specific day ranges for events. I need to make sure the day ranges add up correctly and that each transition uses a direct flight as per the provided list.\n</think>",
