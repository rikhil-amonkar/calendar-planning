They also mentioned that they plan to visit relatives in Riga between day 1 and day 2, so Riga should be the starting point.\n\nFirst, I'll start with Riga since that's where they need to be on days 1-2. From Riga, there's a direct flight to Amsterdam, so the next stop is Amsterdam for days 3-4. After Amsterdam, they can fly directly to Mykonos, where they'll spend the remaining 5 days, from day 5 to day 9.\n\nI need to make sure the day ranges don't overlap and that each city is visited for the specified number of days. Also, the direct flights are only between Riga-Amsterdam and Amsterdam-Mykonos, so the order makes sense.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n- Day 1-2: Riga\n- Day 3-4: Amsterdam\n- Day 5-9: Mykonos\n\nThis fits perfectly into the 7-day plan without any overlaps or gaps.\n</think>",
