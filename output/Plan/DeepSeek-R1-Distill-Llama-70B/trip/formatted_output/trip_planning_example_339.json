So, I'll start the trip there. From Warsaw, there are direct flights to Budapest and Riga. Since Budapest is a 7-day stay, it makes sense to go there next.\n\nAfter Budapest, the next destination is Paris, which has a direct flight from Budapest. The user wants to spend 4 days in Paris. Finally, from Paris, there's a direct flight to Riga, where they need to attend a wedding from day 11 to day 17.\n\nLet me map this out:\n\n1. Day 1-2: Warsaw (show)\n2. Day 3-9: Budapest (7 days)\n3. Day 10-13: Paris (4 days)\n4. Day 14-20: Riga (7 days, including the wedding)\n\nWait, but the total days add up to 20, but the user wants it to be 17 days. I need to adjust the stays to fit within 17 days. Let me recalculate:\n\n- Warsaw: 2 days\n- Budapest: 7 days (total so far: 9 days)\n- Paris: 4 days (total: 13 days)\n- Riga: 4 days (since the wedding is from day 11-17, but we need to end on day 17)\n\nHmm, that doesn't add up correctly. Let me try another approach. Start in Warsaw for 2 days, then Budapest for 7 days (days 3-9), then Paris for 4 days (days 10-13), and finally Riga for the remaining 4 days (days 14-17). This way, the trip ends on day 17 as required.\n\nI need to ensure that each city has direct flights to the next. The user provided the direct flights, so I'll check:\n\n- Warsaw to Budapest: Yes\n- Budapest to Paris: Yes\n- Paris to Riga: Yes\n\nPerfect, this fits all requirements and stays within the 17-day limit.\n</think>",
