So, Riga will be from day 1-2. Then, they need to go to Istanbul for the wedding, which is days 2-7. But wait, day 2 is already covered in Riga, so maybe the wedding starts on day 3? Or perhaps the days can overlap. I'll adjust the wedding to days 3-8 to avoid conflict.\n\nNext, after Istanbul, they can go to Warsaw for 3 days, say days 9-11. Then, they have Krakow for 7 days, which would be days 12-18. Finally, Reykjavik for 7 days, days 19-25. That adds up to 25 days, but the user wants 21 days. I need to adjust the days to fit.\n\nMaybe the wedding can be days 2-7 without overlapping. So, Riga on day 1, then Istanbul days 2-7. Then Warsaw days 8-10, Krakow days 11-17, and Reykjavik days 18-24. That's 24 days. I'll shorten Reykjavik to 6 days, making it days 18-23, totaling 23 days. That's closer.
