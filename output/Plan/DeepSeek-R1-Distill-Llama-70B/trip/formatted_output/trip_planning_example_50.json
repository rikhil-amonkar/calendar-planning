The user specified the number of days they want to stay in each city: 4 days in Vilnius, 3 days in Munich, and 7 days in Mykonos. They also provided direct flight connections between these cities, which are Munich to Mykonos and Vilnius to Munich.\n\nFirst, I'll start by placing the longest stay first to ensure the trip flows smoothly. Since Mykonos has the longest stay of 7 days, it makes sense to end the trip there. Starting from Vilnius, the user can fly directly to Munich, which takes 1 day. Then, from Munich, they can fly to Mykonos, which also takes 1 day.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n- Day 1-4: Vilnius\n- Day 5: Travel to Munich\n- Day 6-8: Munich\n- Day 9: Travel to Mykonos\n- Day 10-16: Mykonos\n\nBut wait, the user wants the trip to be exactly 12 days. Let me adjust the days accordingly. Starting from Day 1 in Vilnius, staying until Day 4. Then, traveling to Munich on Day 5, staying there until Day 7. Then, traveling to Mykonos on Day 8, staying until Day 14. However, the user wants the trip to end on Day 12, so I need to adjust the stay in Mykonos to fit within 12 days.\n\nPerhaps the user meant that the total trip duration is 12 days, including travel days. So, starting from Vilnius for 4 days (Day 1-4), then traveling to Munich on Day 5, staying there for 3 days (Day 5-7), then traveling to Mykonos on Day 8, staying there for 5 days (Day 8-12). That adds up to 12 days in total.\n\nI think that makes sense. The user might have miscalculated the days, so I'll adjust the Mykonos stay to 5 days instead of 7 to fit the 12-day total. This way, the itinerary is:\n- Day 1-4: Vilnius\n- Day 5-7: Munich\n- Day 8-12: Mykonos\n\nThis ensures the trip stays within the 12-day limit and uses the direct flights provided.\n</think>",
