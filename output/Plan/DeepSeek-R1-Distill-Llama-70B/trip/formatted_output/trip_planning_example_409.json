There's a conference in Split on days 4 and 10, so I need to ensure the traveler is there for those days.\n\nFirst, I'll start with Zurich since the wedding is there from day 1 to 3. That makes sense as the starting point. From Zurich, I can go to Split directly since there's a conference starting on day 4. The traveler will stay in Split until day 10, attending the conference and then having some extra time there.\n\nAfter Split, the next logical city is Hamburg, which has a direct flight from Split. The traveler spends 2 days there. Then, from Hamburg, they can fly to Helsinki, where they stay for 2 days. \n\nFrom Helsinki, the next destination is Bucharest, with a direct flight, and they spend 2 days there. Finally, they fly back to Split for the remaining days, but since the trip is only 12 days, I need to adjust the itinerary to fit within that timeframe.\n\nWait, I realize that the initial plan exceeds 12 days, so I'll need to adjust.
