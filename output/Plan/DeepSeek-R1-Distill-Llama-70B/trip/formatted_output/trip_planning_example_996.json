            "reasoning": "Okay, I need to plan a trip itinerary for 22 days across 7 European cities. The user has specified the cities and the number of days to spend in each, along with some specific events and meetings. Let me list out the cities and their durations first:\n\n- Valencia: 5 days\n- Riga: 5 days\n- Prague: 3 days (with a visit to relatives between days 7-9)\n- Mykonos: 3 days (attending a wedding days 1-3)\n- Zurich: 5 days\n- Bucharest: 5 days\n- Nice: 2 days\n\nThe user also provided direct flight connections between these cities. My goal is to arrange these cities in an order that respects the event timings and uses the available flights.\n\nFirst, the wedding in Mykonos is on days 1-3, so Mykonos should be the starting point. After Mykonos, I need to connect to another city with a direct flight. From the flight list, Mykonos connects to Nice and Zurich. Since the next destination after Mykonos isn't specified, but considering the need to reach Prague by day 7, I'll choose Zurich because it connects to more cities, including Prague.\n\nFrom Zurich, I can go to Prague, which has a direct flight. Prague needs to be visited by day 7-9 to meet relatives. After Prague, the next city should be one that connects to Riga, as Riga is next. Prague connects to Riga directly. So after Prague, Riga makes sense.\n\nRiga connects to Nice, but since Nice is only 2 days and better placed towards the end, I'll go from Riga to Bucharest, which has a direct flight and is a 5-day stay. From Bucharest, there's a direct flight to Valencia, which is a 5-day stay. After Valencia, the next logical step is to Nice, which connects directly from Valencia or Bucharest.\n\nWait, but the user wants to stay in Nice for 2 days, so placing it at the end makes sense. Let me check the flight connections again to ensure all transitions are possible.\n\nSo, the order would be:\n\n1. Mykonos (days 1-3)\n2. Zurich (days 4-8) \u2013 5 days\n3. Prague (days 9-11) \u2013 3 days, but needs to be days 7-9. Hmm, this might not align. Maybe adjust the order.\n\nAlternatively, after Mykonos, go to Nice first, but that would make the trip too scattered. Let me try another approach.\n\nStarting with Mykonos (days 1-3), then to Zurich (days 4-8), then to Prague (days 9-11), then to Riga (days 12-16), then to Bucharest (days 17-21), then to Valencia (days 22-26), and finally to Nice (days 27-28). But this exceeds the 22-day limit.\n\nWait, the total days should be 22, so I need to adjust the stays to fit within that. Maybe reduce some durations, but the user specified exact days. Alternatively, adjust the order to fit all within 22 days.\n\nAnother approach: Mykonos (1-3), Zurich (4-8), Prague (9-11), Riga (12-16), Bucharest (17-21), Valencia (22-26), but this goes beyond 22 days. I need to fit all within 22 days.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Mykonos (1-3)\n2. Zurich (4-8) \u2013 5 days\n3. Prague (9-11) \u2013 3 days\n4. Riga (12-16) \u2013 5 days\n5. Bucharest (17-21) \u2013 5 days\n6. Valencia (22-26) \u2013 5 days\n7. Nice (27-28) \u2013 2 days\n\nBut this is 28 days, which is over. I must have miscalculated.\n\nWait, the user wants exactly 22 days. So, let's recalculate:\n\nMykonos: 3 days\nZurich: 5 days (total 8)\nPrague: 3 days (total 11)\nRiga: 5 days (total 16)\nBucharest: 5 days (total 21)\nValencia: 5 days (total 26)\nNice: 2 days (total 28)\n\nThis is 28 days, but the user needs 22 days. There's a discrepancy. Perhaps some stays can be shortened, but the user specified exact days. Alternatively, reorganize to fit.\n\nMaybe combine some stays or adjust the order to minimize travel days. Let me try:\n\nMykonos (1-3)\nZurich (4-8) \u2013 5 days\nPrague (9-11) \u2013 3 days\nRiga (12-16) \u2013 5 days\nBucharest (17-21) \u2013 5 days\nValencia (22-26) \u2013 5 days\nNice (27-28) \u2013 2 days\n\nBut this still exceeds. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the total days. Assuming the total is 28, but the user says 22, I'll proceed with the initial plan, noting the discrepancy.\n</think>",
