The user wants to visit four European cities over 16 days with specific constraints. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the requirements:\n\n1. Visit Split for 5 days, with an annual show from day 7 to day 11.\n2. Visit Oslo for 2 days.\n3. Spend 7 days in London, visiting relatives from day 1 to day 7.\n4. Visit Porto for 5 days.\n\nDirect flights are available between:\n- London and Oslo\n- Split and Oslo\n- Oslo and Porto\n- London and Split\n\nI'll start by placing the longest stay first since it might have fixed dates. The user wants to spend 7 days in London, with relatives from day 1 to day 7. So, London will be from day 1 to day 7.\n\nNext, the annual show in Split is from day 7 to day 11, but the stay in Split is 5 days. To cover the show, Split should start on day 7 and end on day 11. However, the user wants to spend 5 days there, so perhaps adjusting the stay to cover days 7 to 11 fits perfectly.\n\nAfter Split, the next city is Oslo for 2 days. Since there's a direct flight from Split to Oslo, it makes sense to go there next. So, Oslo would be from day 12 to day 13.\n\nFinally, Porto for 5 days. There's a direct flight from Oslo to Porto, so Porto will be from day 14 to day 18.\n\nWait, but the total days should be 16. Let me check:\n\n- London: 1-7 (7 days)\n- Split: 7-11 (5 days)\n- Oslo: 12-13 (2 days)\n- Porto: 14-18 (5 days)\n\nBut day 7 is shared between London and Split, which might not be possible. So, perhaps adjusting Split to start on day 8.\n\nRevised plan:\n\n- London: 1-7 (7 days)\n- Split: 8-12 (5 days)\n- Oslo: 13-14 (2 days)\n- Porto: 15-19 (5 days)\n\nBut this exceeds the 16-day limit. Let me adjust:\n\n- London: 1-7 (7 days)\n- Split: 8-12 (5 days)\n- Oslo: 13-14 (2 days)\n- Porto: 15-19 (5 days)\n\nThis totals 19 days, which is too long. I need to fit it into 16 days.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- London: 1-7 (7 days)\n- Split: 8-12 (5 days)\n- Oslo: 13-14 (2 days)\n- Porto: 15-16 (2 days)\n\nBut Porto needs 5 days. Hmm, perhaps overlapping the end:\n\n- London: 1-7 (7 days)\n- Split: 7-11 (5 days)\n- Oslo: 12-13 (2 days)\n- Porto: 14-18 (5 days)\n\nThis still totals 18 days. I need to fit it into 16.\n\nPerhaps reducing Porto's stay, but the user specified 5 days. Maybe adjusting the start:\n\n- London: 1-7 (7 days)\n- Split: 8-12 (5 days)\n- Oslo: 13-14 (2 days)\n- Porto: 15-19 (5 days)\n\nThis is 19 days. I'm over the limit. Maybe the user can adjust their stay durations, but since they specified, I'll proceed with the closest fit.\n\nFinal plan:\n\n- London: 1-7\n- Split: 8-12\n- Oslo: 13-14\n- Porto: 15-19\n\nEven though it's 19 days, it's the best fit with the given constraints.\n</think>",
