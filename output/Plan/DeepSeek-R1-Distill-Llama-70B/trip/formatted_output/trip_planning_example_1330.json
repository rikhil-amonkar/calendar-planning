The user has provided specific details about the number of days to stay in each city and some events they want to attend.

After Nice, the traveler can go to Zurich, which has direct flights to many other cities. From Zurich, they can go to Bucharest, then to Hamburg, which connects to Copenhagen for the wedding. After Copenhagen, they can head to Brussels to meet friends, then to Naples for the workshop, and finally back to a major hub like Zurich if needed.\n\nI'll outline the itinerary step by step, ensuring each city is visited for the specified number of days and all events are attended as planned. I'll make sure the transitions between cities are possible via direct flights as provided.\n\nAfter mapping out the days and ensuring all requirements are met, I'll compile the itinerary in the specified JSON format.\n</think>",
