The user has provided specific requirements for each city, including the number of days to stay and any events they want to attend. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the cities and the number of days the user wants to spend in each:\n\n- Paris: 5 days\n- Florence: 3 days\n- Vienna: 2 days (with a visit to relatives between day 19 and 20)\n- Porto: 3 days (with a workshop between day 1 and 3)\n- Munich: 5 days\n- Nice: 5 days\n- Warsaw: 3 days (with a wedding between day 13 and 15)\n\nNext, I'll consider the direct flights available between these cities, as provided:\n\n- Florence and Vienna\n- Paris and Warsaw\n- Munich and Vienna\n- Porto and Vienna\n- Warsaw and Vienna\n- Florence and Munich\n- Munich and Warsaw\n- Munich and Nice\n- Paris and Florence\n- Warsaw and Nice\n- Porto and Munich\n- Porto and Nice\n- Paris and Vienna\n- Nice and Vienna\n- Porto and Paris\n- Paris and Nice\n- Paris and Munich\n- Porto and Warsaw\n\nNow, I need to create a logical sequence that connects these cities using direct flights while respecting the number of days and event timings.\n\nStarting with Porto since the user has to attend a workshop there from day 1 to 3. From Porto, there are direct flights to Vienna, Munich, Nice, and Paris.\n\nVienna is a good next stop because it's a short flight from Porto and the user wants to spend 2 days there. Plus, the user needs to visit relatives in Vienna towards the end, but since the stay is short, it's better to place Vienna earlier to avoid backtracking.\n\nFrom Vienna, the next logical city could be Florence, as there's a direct flight, and the user wants to spend 3 days there.\n\nAfter Florence, moving to Paris makes sense because there's a direct flight, and Paris is a central hub with many connections. The user plans to stay in Paris for 5 days, so this fits well.\n\nFrom Paris, the next destination could be Warsaw, as there's a direct flight, and the user has a wedding to attend there from day 13 to 15. Staying in Warsaw for 3 days fits the timeline.\n\nAfter Warsaw, heading to Munich is logical since there's a direct flight, and the user wants to spend 5 days there.\n\nFrom Munich, the next stop is Nice, with a direct flight, allowing the user to spend 5 days there as planned.\n\nFinally, returning to Vienna for the last two days to visit relatives fits perfectly, as there's a direct flight from Nice to Vienna.\n\nThis sequence ensures that all cities are visited within the specified number of days, and all events and workshops are attended as required.\n</think>",
