            "reasoning": "Alright, so I've got this task to plan a trip itinerary for someone visiting 5 European cities over 8 days. The cities are Prague, Stuttgart, Split, Krakow, and Florence. The user has specific requirements about where they want to stay and when, so I need to make sure I meet those.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the cities and the number of days they want to spend in each:\n\n- Prague: 4 days\n- Stuttgart: 2 days\n- Split: 2 days\n- Krakow: 2 days\n- Florence: 2 days\n\nWait, that adds up to 10 days, but the user wants the trip to be 8 days. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, I see, the user actually wants to visit 5 cities but only has 8 days in total. So I need to adjust the days accordingly.\n\nLooking at the user's instructions, they want to stay in Prague for 4 days, Stuttgart for 2 days, Split for 2 days, Krakow for 2 days, and Florence for 2 days. But that's 12 days, which is more than 8. There's a contradiction here. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps they want to adjust the number of days per city to fit into 8 days. I'll assume they want to visit each city once, but with fewer days.\n\nThe user also mentions specific events:\n\n- Attend a wedding in Stuttgart between day 2 and day 3.\n- Meet friends in Split between day 3 and day 4.\n\nSo I need to ensure Stuttgart is visited around days 2-3 and Split around days 3-4. That suggests that Stuttgart and Split are close together in the itinerary.\n\nLooking at the direct flights provided:\n\n- Stuttgart and Split\n- Prague and Florence\n- Krakow and Stuttgart\n- Krakow and Split\n- Split and Prague\n- Krakow and Prague\n\nThis means I can move between these cities directly, which is helpful.\n\nI'll start by placing the wedding in Stuttgart on days 2-3. So Stuttgart should be on days 2-3. Then, meeting friends in Split on days 3-4 means Split should come right after Stuttgart. \n\nBut wait, if Stuttgart is days 2-3, and Split is days 3-4, there's an overlap on day 3. That's not possible unless they can attend both on day 3, but that might be tight. Maybe I should adjust so that Stuttgart is days 2-3, and Split is days 4-5.\n\nNow, starting from day 1, where should the trip begin? The user didn't specify a starting point, so I'll choose Prague as the first city since it's a common starting point and has direct flights to Florence.\n\nSo, day 1: Prague.\n\nThen, day 2: Travel to Stuttgart for the wedding on days 2-3.\n\nAfter Stuttgart, go to Split on days 4-5 to meet friends.\n\nFrom Split, the next city could be Krakow, as there's a direct flight. So days 6-7: Krakow.\n\nFinally, end in Florence on days 8-9, but since the trip is only 8 days, Florence would be on day 8.\n\nWait, but the user wants to spend 2 days in Florence, so maybe adjust:\n\nDay 1-2: Prague\n\nDay 3-4: Stuttgart\n\nDay 5-6: Split\n\nDay 7-8: Krakow\n\nBut then Florence isn't included. Hmm, perhaps I need to include Florence on the last day.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the days per city to fit 8 days:\n\nDay 1-2: Prague\n\nDay 3-4: Stuttgart\n\nDay 5-6: Split\n\nDay 7: Krakow\n\nDay 8: Florence\n\nBut the user wants to spend 2 days in Florence, so maybe:\n\nDay 1-2: Prague\n\nDay 3-4: Stuttgart\n\nDay 5-6: Split\n\nDay 7-8: Florence\n\nBut then Krakow is left out. This is tricky. Since the user wants to visit 5 cities in 8 days, each city will have about 1-2 days.\n\nPerhaps:\n\nDay 1: Prague\n\nDay 2: Stuttgart\n\nDay 3: Split\n\nDay 4: Krakow\n\nDay 5: Florence\n\nBut that's only 5 days, and the user wants 8 days. Maybe extend some stays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to have longer stays but within 8 days. I'll adjust the days per city to fit:\n\n- Prague: 2 days\n\n- Stuttgart: 2 days\n\n- Split: 2 days\n\n- Krakow: 1 day\n\n- Florence: 1 day\n\nBut the user specified 4 days in Prague, which complicates things. Maybe they made a mistake, and I should proceed with the best fit.\n\nI'll create an itinerary that includes all 5 cities within 8 days, ensuring the events in Stuttgart and Split are on the correct days.\n\nFinal itinerary:\n\nDay 1-2: Prague\n\nDay 3-4: Stuttgart (wedding on day 3)\n\nDay 5-6: Split (meeting friends on day 4, so adjust to days 4-5)\n\nWait, that's overlapping. Maybe:\n\nDay 1-2: Prague\n\nDay 3-4: Stuttgart\n\nDay 5-6: Split\n\nDay 7: Krakow\n\nDay 8: Florence\n\nBut the user wants to spend 2 days in Florence, so perhaps:\n\nDay 1-2: Prague\n\nDay 3-4: Stuttgart\n\nDay 5-6: Split\n\nDay 7-8: Florence\n\nBut then Krakow is missed. Alternatively, include Krakow on day 7 and Florence on day 8.\n\nThis is a bit confusing, but I'll proceed with the initial plan, ensuring the events are on the correct days.\n</think>",
