First, I'll list out all the cities and their required stays:\n\n- Copenhagen: 5 days (meet a friend between days 11-15)\n- Geneva: 3 days\n- Mykonos: 2 days (conference on days 27-28)\n- Naples: 4 days (visit relatives days 5-8)\n- Prague: 2 days\n- Dubrovnik: 3 days\n- Athens: 4 days (workshop days 8-11)\n- Santorini: 5 days\n- Brussels: 4 days\n- Munich: 5 days\n\nNext, I'll consider the direct flights available between these cities to ensure smooth transitions. The user provided a list of direct flights, which I'll use to map out possible routes.\n\nStarting with Naples since the user needs to be there between days 5-8. It makes sense to start the trip here. From Naples, there are direct flights to Dubrovnik, Athens, Munich, and others. Since Athens has a workshop from days 8-11, moving to Athens after Naples seems logical.\n\nAfter Athens, the next destination should align with the workshop ending on day 11. Copenhagen needs to be visited around days 11-15, so flying from Athens to Copenhagen fits well. Copenhagen then connects to Brussels, which is a 4-day stay.\n\nFrom Brussels, moving to Munich makes sense as there are direct flights and Munich requires a 5-day stay. After Munich, heading to Prague for 2 days is feasible with direct flights. Then, from Prague to Geneva for a 3-day stay.\n\nGeneva connects well to Santorini, which needs a 5-day visit. Finally, ending in Mykonos for the last 2 days to attend the conference.\n\nI need to ensure that each city's stay duration matches the user's requirements and that the dates for events are respected. Adjusting the itinerary to fit all stays and events without overlap is crucial.\n\nAfter mapping out the possible connections and ensuring all requirements are met, the final itinerary should flow smoothly, respecting all specified day ranges and direct flight connections.\n</think>",
