The user provided a list of direct flight connections, so I'll use that to determine the order.\n\nStarting in Vienna makes sense since the user has a conference there on day 1 and 4. After Vienna, the next logical city is Milan, as there's a direct flight from Vienna to Milan. From Milan, Rome is a good next step since it's a short flight and the user plans to stay there for 3 days.\n\nAfter Rome, Riga is reachable via a direct flight, and the user wants to spend 2 days there. From Riga, flying to Vilnius is possible, and the user plans a 4-day stay there. Following Vilnius, Lisbon is next, as there's a direct flight and the user wants to visit relatives there. Finally, ending in Oslo allows the user to meet their friend and wraps up the trip.\n\nI'll map out the days accordingly, ensuring each city's visit duration matches the user's request and that all events are attended as planned. I'll make sure the itinerary flows smoothly without any backtracking, using the direct flights provided.\n</think>",
