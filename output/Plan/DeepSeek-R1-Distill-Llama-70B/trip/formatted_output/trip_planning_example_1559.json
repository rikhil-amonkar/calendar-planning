The user has provided specific day ranges and events they want to attend in certain cities. My goal is to create a logical sequence that fits all these requirements.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the cities and the number of days the user wants to stay in each:\n\n- Valencia: 2 days (meet friends between day 3-4)\n- Oslo: 3 days (meet a friend between day 13-15)\n- Lyon: 4 days\n- Prague: 3 days\n- Paris: 4 days\n- Nice: 4 days\n- Seville: 5 days (annual show day 5-9)\n- Tallinn: 2 days\n- Mykonos: 5 days (wedding day 21-25)\n- Lisbon: 2 days\n\nNext, I'll note the direct flight connections provided:\n\n- Lisbon and Paris\n- Lyon and Nice\n- Tallinn and Oslo\n- Prague and Lyon\n- Paris and Oslo\n- Lisbon and Seville\n- Prague and Lisbon\n- Oslo and Nice\n- Valencia and Paris\n- Valencia and Lisbon\n- Paris and Nice\n- Nice and Mykonos\n- Paris and Lyon\n- Valencia and Lyon\n- Prague and Oslo\n- Prague and Paris\n- Seville and Paris\n- Oslo and Lyon\n- Prague and Valencia\n- Lisbon and Nice\n- Lisbon and Oslo\n- Valencia and Seville\n- Lisbon and Lyon\n- Paris and Tallinn\n- Prague and Tallinn\n\nNow, I'll start mapping out the itinerary, ensuring that each city is visited for the specified number of days and that the events occur within the correct date ranges.\n\n1. **Valencia (2 days)**: The user wants to meet friends here between day 3-4, so Valencia should be placed early in the trip. However, since the user wants to start in Valencia, I'll place it at the beginning.\n\n2. **Lisbon (2 days)**: The user wants to visit Lisbon, and there's a direct flight from Valencia to Lisbon. So, after Valencia, Lisbon makes sense.\n\n3. **Seville (5 days)**: The annual show is from day 5-9, so Seville should start on day 5. There's a direct flight from Lisbon to Seville.\n\n4. **Paris (4 days)**: The user wants to spend 4 days in Paris, and there's a direct flight from Seville to Paris.\n\n5. **Lyon (4 days)**: From Paris, the user can fly directly to Lyon, which fits the 4-day stay.\n\n6. **Nice (4 days)**: Direct flights from Lyon to Nice make this the next logical stop.\n\n7. **Mykonos (5 days)**: The wedding is from day 21-25, so Mykonos should be placed towards the end. There's a direct flight from Nice to Mykonos.\n\n8. **Prague (3 days)**: After Mykonos, the user can fly back to a central European city like Prague.\n\n9. **Oslo (3 days)**: The user wants to meet a friend in Oslo between day 13-15, but given the current flow, Oslo might need to be adjusted to fit the timeline.\n\n10. **Tallinn (2 days)**: Finally, the user can fly from Oslo to Tallinn.\n\nWait, I realize that placing Oslo after Mykonos might not align with the desired meeting time. Let me adjust the order to ensure events happen on the correct days.\n\nRevised plan:\n\n1. **Valencia (2 days)**: Days 1-2\n2. **Lisbon (2 days)**: Days 3-4 (meet friends in Valencia on days 3-4, but since Valencia is only 2 days, this might not work. I need to adjust.)\n\nPerhaps starting in Lisbon first:\n\n1. **Lisbon (2 days)**: Days 1-2\n2. **Valencia (2 days)**: Days 3-4 (meet friends here)\n3. **Seville (5 days)**: Days 5-9 (annual show)\n4. **Paris (4 days)**: Days 10-13\n5. **Lyon (4 days)**: Days 14-17\n6. **Nice (4 days)**: Days 18-21\n7. **Mykonos (5 days)**: Days 22-26 (wedding)\n8. **Prague (3 days)**: Days 27-29\n9. **Oslo (3 days)**: Days 30-32 (but the trip is only 25 days, so this doesn't fit. I need to adjust.)\n\nI realize the user's trip is only 25 days, so I need to fit all cities within this timeframe. Perhaps Oslo and Tallinn can be placed earlier.\n\nFinal adjustment:\n\n1. **Valencia (2 days)**: Days 1-2\n2. **Lisbon (2 days)**: Days 3-4\n3. **Seville (5 days)**: Days 5-9\n4. **Paris (4 days)**: Days 10-13\n5. **Lyon (4 days)**: Days 14-17\n6. **Nice (4 days)**: Days 18-21\n7. **Mykonos (5 days)**: Days 22-26\n8. **Prague (3 days)**: Days 27-29\n9. **Oslo (3 days)**: Days 30-32 (exceeds 25 days)\n10. **Tallinn (2 days)**: Days 33-34 (also exceeds)\n\nI need to ensure all cities are visited within 25 days.

Therefore, I need to remove or adjust some cities, but the user specified 10 cities.
