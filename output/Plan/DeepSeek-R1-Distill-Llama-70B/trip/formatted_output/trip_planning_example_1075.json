            "reasoning": "Alright, let's try to tackle this trip planning problem. So, the user wants to visit 8 European cities over 25 days, and they have specific requirements for each city, including the number of days they want to stay and some events they need to attend. They also provided a list of direct flights between these cities, which is crucial because they can only travel via direct flights.\n\nFirst, I need to list out all the cities and their required stays:\n\n- Vienna: 4 days\n- Lyon: 3 days\n- Edinburgh: 4 days (with an annual show from day 5 to day 8)\n- Reykjavik: 5 days\n- Stuttgart: 5 days\n- Manchester: 2 days\n- Split: 5 days (with a wedding from day 19 to day 23)\n- Prague: 4 days\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the itinerary aligns with these requirements. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Edinburgh** needs to be visited from day 5 to day 8 because of the annual show. So, Edinburgh should be placed around those days. Since the user wants to spend 4 days there, it makes sense to have Edinburgh from day 5 to day 8.\n\n2. **Split** has a wedding from day 19 to day 23, so the user needs to be there during those days. They want to spend 5 days in Split, so the stay would likely be from day 19 to day 23.\n\n3. **Reykjavik** is a 5-day stay, and since there's no specific event tied to it, it can be placed earlier in the trip.\n\n4. **Stuttgart** is also a 5-day stay. Looking at the direct flights, Stuttgart connects to several cities like Reykjavik, Vienna, and Split, so it's flexible.\n\n5. **Vienna** needs 4 days, and it connects to several cities as well, including Stuttgart and Lyon.\n\n6. **Lyon** is a 3-day stay, and it connects to Vienna and Split.\n\n7. **Manchester** is a 2-day stay and connects to several cities like Prague and Split.\n\n8. **Prague** is a 4-day stay and connects to Edinburgh, Vienna, and others.\n\nNow, considering the direct flights, I need to ensure that each city is reachable from the previous one via a direct flight. Let's try to map this out.\n\nStarting with **Reykjavik** for 5 days (days 1-5). From Reykjavik, there's a direct flight to Vienna, so next is Vienna for 4 days (days 6-9). From Vienna, there's a direct flight to Lyon, so Lyon for 3 days (days 10-12). From Lyon, there's a direct flight to Split, but Split needs to be around days 19-23. So, after Lyon, we might need to go to another city first.\n\nWait, maybe after Vienna, instead of going to Lyon, we can go to Stuttgart since there's a direct flight from Vienna to Stuttgart. So, Stuttgart for 5 days (days 10-14). From Stuttgart, there's a direct flight to Edinburgh, which needs to be around days 5-8. But days 5-8 are already taken by Edinburgh, so that might not work.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to adjust. Let's try:\n\n- Start with Reykjavik (days 1-5)\n- Then go to Vienna (days 6-9)\n- From Vienna to Lyon (days 10-12)\n- From Lyon to Split (days 13-17)\n- But Split needs to be from 19-23, so maybe insert another city in between.\n\nAlternatively, after Vienna, go to Prague, which connects to Edinburgh. So:\n\n- Reykjavik (1-5)\n- Vienna (6-9)\n- Prague (10-13)\n- Edinburgh (14-17) but Edinburgh needs to be from day 5-8, which conflicts.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe start with Edinburgh first since it has fixed days.\n\n- Edinburgh (5-8)\n- Then from Edinburgh, there's a direct flight to Prague (days 9-12)\n- From Prague to Vienna (days 13-16)\n- Vienna to Lyon (days 17-19)\n- Lyon to Split (days 20-24)\n- But Split needs to be from 19-23, so adjust Lyon to end by day 18.\n\nWait, Lyon is 3 days, so if Split starts on day 19, Lyon would be days 16-18.\n\nLet me try:\n\n- Reykjavik (1-5)\n- Vienna (6-9)\n- Prague (10-13)\n- Edinburgh (14-17) but Edinburgh needs to be days 5-8.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe:\n\n- Start with Edinburgh (5-8)\n- Then go to Prague (9-12)\n- From Prague to Vienna (13-16)\n- Vienna to Lyon (17-19)\n- Lyon to Split (20-24)\n- But the user wants Split from 19-23, so maybe adjust.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Edinburgh (5-8)\n- Prague (9-12)\n- Vienna (13-16)\n- Stuttgart (17-21)\n- Stuttgart to Split (22-26), but the trip is only 25 days.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe prioritize the fixed events first: Edinburgh (5-8) and Split (19-23). Then fill in the other cities around these dates.\n\nSo:\n\n- Days 1-4: Reykjavik\n- Days 5-8: Edinburgh\n- Days 9-12: Prague\n- Days 13-16: Vienna\n- Days 17-19: Lyon\n- Days 20-24: Split\n- Days 25: ?\n\nWait, the total days should be 25. So, perhaps:\n\n- Reykjavik (1-5)\n- Edinburgh (6-9) but needs to be 5-8\n- So, adjust:\n\n- Reykjavik (1-4)\n- Edinburgh (5-8)\n- Prague (9-12)\n- Vienna (13-16)\n- Lyon (17-19)\n- Split (20-24)\n- Then, where to go on day 25? Maybe Manchester for 2 days, but that would require adjusting.\n\nAlternatively, extend one of the stays or adjust the days accordingly.\n\nI think I need to map this out carefully, ensuring that each city's required days are met and that direct flights are available between each consecutive city.\n</think>",
