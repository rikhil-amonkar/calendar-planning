Since these two events overlap on day 3, the user can't be in both places at once. So, I'll need to adjust the itinerary to accommodate this without overlap.\n\nStarting with Manchester from day 1-3 for the wedding makes sense. Then, moving to Venice for the workshop from day 4-10 (since day 3 is the last day in Manchester). After Venice, the next logical step is Istanbul, which has a 7-day stay. From Istanbul, moving to Krakow for 6 days, and finally ending in Lyon for 2 days.\n\nI'll check the direct flights to ensure each transition is possible:\n- Manchester to Venice: Direct flight available.\n- Venice to Istanbul: Direct flight available.\n- Istanbul to Krakow: Direct flight available.\n- Krakow to Lyon: Direct flight available.\n\nThis sequence fits all the requirements without overlapping events and uses direct flights as specified.\n</think>",
