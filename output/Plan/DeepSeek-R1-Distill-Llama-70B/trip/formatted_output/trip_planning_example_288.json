Let's break down the requirements and see how to best arrange the travel schedule.\n\nFirst, the user wants to visit Stuttgart for 5 days, but the workshop there is from day 11 to day 15. So, Stuttgart should be scheduled during those days. They also plan to stay in Manchester for 7 days, attending a wedding from day 1 to day 7. That means Manchester should be the starting point, covering the first 7 days.\n\nNext, the user wants to spend 4 days in Madrid and 2 days in Vienna. Looking at the direct flights provided, there's a connection from Manchester to Madrid, so after Manchester, Madrid makes sense. From Madrid, there's a direct flight to Vienna, which fits the 2-day stay. Finally, from Vienna, there's a direct flight to Stuttgart, where the user will spend the last 5 days attending the workshop.\n\nSo, the logical order would be:\n1. Manchester (days 1-7)\n2. Madrid (days 8-11)\n3. Vienna (days 12-13)\n4. Stuttgart (days 14-18)\n\nThis sequence ensures that each city is visited within the specified days and aligns with the workshops and weddings the user needs to attend. I need to make sure the day ranges don't overlap and that each destination is reached via direct flights as specified.\n</think>",
