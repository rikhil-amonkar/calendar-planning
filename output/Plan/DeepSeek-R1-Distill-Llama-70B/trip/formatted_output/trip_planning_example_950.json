They have specific events and meetings in some cities, so I need to make sure the schedule aligns with those.\n\nFirst, the user wants to attend a conference in Rome on days 1 and 4. So, I'll start the trip in Rome, but since they need to be there on day 1, they should arrive by day 1. After the conference, they can stay a few more days.\n\nNext, they have a wedding in Mykonos between days 4 and 6. So, after Rome, they should fly to Mykonos, arriving by day 4. They'll spend days 4-6 there.\n\nFrom Mykonos, they need to go to Nice, where they'll spend 3 days. There's a direct flight from Mykonos to Nice, so that's convenient.\n\nAfter Nice, they head to Riga for 3 days. There's a direct flight from Nice to Riga, so that's straightforward.\n\nFrom Riga, they go to Munich for 4 days. There's a direct flight from Riga to Munich, which works well.\n\nThen, they need to visit Bucharest for 4 days. There's a direct flight from Munich to Bucharest, so that's the next stop.\n\nAfter Bucharest, they need to go to Krakow for 2 days, where they have an annual show on days 16-17. There's a direct flight from Bucharest to Krakow, so they can arrive in time for the event.\n\nI need to make sure the days add up correctly and that each city is visited for the specified number of days without overlapping. Let me map this out step by step.\n\nStarting in Rome for the conference, then Mykonos for the wedding, followed by Nice, Riga, Munich, Bucharest, and finally Krakow. Each leg has direct flights, so the itinerary should flow smoothly.\n\nI think this order makes sense and covers all the cities and events as specified.
