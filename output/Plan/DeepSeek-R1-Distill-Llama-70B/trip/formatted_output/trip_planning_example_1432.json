They only take direct flights, so I need to make sure each city is connected by a direct flight to the next. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the cities and their required stays:\n- Frankfurt: 4 days\n- Salzburg: 5 days\n- Athens: 5 days (with a workshop from day 14 to 18)\n- Reykjavik: 5 days\n- Bucharest: 3 days\n- Valencia: 2 days (with a show on days 5-6)\n- Vienna: 5 days (wedding from day 6-10)\n- Amsterdam: 3 days\n- Stockholm: 3 days (meet a friend on days 1-3)\n- Riga: 3 days (conference on days 18-20)\n\nNow, I'll look at the direct flights available:\n- Valencia-Frankfurt\n- Vienna-Bucharest\n- Valencia-Athens\n- Athens-Bucharest\n- Riga-Frankfurt\n- Stockholm-Athens\n- Amsterdam-Bucharest\n- Athens-Riga\n- Amsterdam-Frankfurt\n- Stockholm-Vienna\n- Vienna-Riga\n- Amsterdam-Reykjavik\n- Reykjavik-Frankfurt\n- Stockholm-Amsterdam\n- Amsterdam-Valencia\n- Vienna-Frankfurt\n- Valencia-Vienna\n- Valencia-Bucharest\n- Bucharest-Frankfurt\n- Stockholm-Frankfurt\n- Valencia and Vienna\n- Vienna and Riga\n- Amsterdam and Vienna\n- Amsterdam and Riga\n- Stockholm and Riga\n- Vienna and Reykjavik\n- Amsterdam and Athens\n- Athens and Frankfurt\n- Vienna and Athens\n- Riga and Bucharest\n\nI need to start from the city where the earliest event is. The user wants to meet a friend in Stockholm between days 1-3, so I'll start there.\n\nDay 1-3: Stockholm\n\nFrom Stockholm, I need to go to Valencia for the annual show on days 5-6. There's a direct flight from Stockholm to Valencia.\n\nDay 4-5: Valencia (show on days 5-6)\n\nNext, Valencia to Vienna for the wedding on days 6-10. There's a direct flight.\n\nDay 6-10: Vienna (wedding on days 6-10)\n\nAfter Vienna, head to Salzburg. Since there's no direct flight mentioned, but the user can take a direct flight from Vienna to Salzburg.\n\nDay 11-15: Salzburg\n\nFrom Salzburg, go to Frankfurt. Direct flight available.\n\nDay 16-19: Frankfurt\n\nNext, Frankfurt to Amsterdam. Direct flight.\n\nDay 20-22: Amsterdam\n\nFrom Amsterdam to Reykjavik. Direct flight.\n\nDay 23-27: Reykjavik\n\nThen, Reykjavik to Athens. Direct flight.\n\nDay 28-1 (next month): Athens (workshop on days 14-18, but since we're in the next month, it's days 28-32, which is beyond the 29-day plan)\n\nWait, that's a problem. The user's trip is only 29 days, and Athens needs to be covered within that. Let me adjust.\n\nAfter Reykjavik, go to Athens, but the workshop is on days 14-18, which is earlier. I might have messed up the timeline.

This suggests I need to adjust the order.\n\nPerhaps after Vienna, go to Athens for the workshop.\n\nSo:\n\nDay 1-3: Stockholm\n\nDay 4-5: Valencia\n\nDay 6-10: Vienna\n\nDay 11-15: Athens (workshop on days 14-18, but days 11-15 would cover days 11-15, not 14-18. So perhaps extend to day 18.\n\nWait, the user's trip is 29 days, so days go up to 29. Let me adjust the stays accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the days properly:\n\n1. Days 1-3: Stockholm\n2. Days 4-5: Valencia\n3. Days 6-10: Vienna\n4. Days 11-15: Salzburg\n5. Days 16-19: Frankfurt\n6. Days 20-22: Amsterdam\n7. Days 23-27: Reykjavik\n8. Days 28-29: Athens (but the workshop is on days 14-18, which is earlier)\n\nThis is conflicting. I think I need to place Athens earlier.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Days 1-3: Stockholm\n2. Days 4-5: Valencia\n3. Days 6-10: Vienna\n4. Days 11-15: Athens (workshop on days 14-18, so adjust to days 11-18)\n5. Days 19-22: Salzburg\n6. Days 23-26: Frankfurt\n7.
