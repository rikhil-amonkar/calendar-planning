The user has specified the number of days to stay in each city and certain events they need to attend, so I should ensure those are accommodated.\n\nFirst, the user wants to stay in Prague for 2 days. Since there's no specific event in Prague, I'll place it at the beginning. Next, Berlin is next with 3 days, and there's a conference on days 6 and 8. However, since Berlin is only 3 days, I need to adjust so that the conference fits within the stay. Maybe the conference spans the end of the Berlin stay and the beginning of the next. \n\nThen, Tallinn is planned for 5 days, with relatives to visit between days 8 and 12. That means Tallinn should cover days 8 to 12. Finally, Stockholm is 5 days, but since the total is 12 days, I'll need to adjust the days to fit.\n\nLooking at the direct flights, I can go from Prague to Berlin, then Berlin to Tallinn, and Tallinn to Stockholm. This makes sense geographically and with the provided flights.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n- Days 1-2: Prague\n- Days 3-5: Berlin (conference on days 3 and 5, adjusting to fit within the 3-day stay)\n- Days 6-10: Tallinn (visiting relatives from day 8, so days 6-10 cover that)\n- Days 11-15: Stockholm\n\nWait, but the total days only go up to 12, so I need to adjust the last part. Maybe Stockholm is days 11-15, but that exceeds the 12-day plan. So I'll shorten Stockholm to days 11-12, making it 2 days, but the user wanted 5 days. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the Tallinn stay to 5 days, so days 6-10, and then Stockholm for the remaining 2 days. But that doesn't meet the 5-day requirement for Stockholm. Maybe I need to extend the trip, but the user specified 12 days. \n\nI think I'll prioritize the events and adjust the stay durations accordingly, ensuring the conference and visiting relatives are covered.\n</think>",
