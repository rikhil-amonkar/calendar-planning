The user wants to visit 6 European cities over 16 days, with specific requirements for each city and some constraints on direct flights.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the cities and their durations:\n- Mykonos: 4 days\n- Nice: 3 days (with a conference on days 14 and 16)\n- London: 2 days\n- Copenhagen: 3 days\n- Oslo: 5 days (meeting a friend between days 10-14)\n- Tallinn: 4 days\n\nNext, I need to consider the direct flight connections provided:\n- London and Copenhagen\n- Copenhagen and Tallinn\n- Tallinn and Oslo\n- Mykonos and London\n- Oslo and Nice\n- London and Nice\n- Mykonos and Nice\n- London and Oslo\n- Copenhagen and Nice\n- Copenhagen and Oslo\n\nI should also note that the user must attend a conference in Nice on days 14 and 16, so the trip must end there.\n\nStarting with Mykonos makes sense since it's a popular starting point, and it has direct flights to London. From Mykonos, flying to London on day 4 would allow a 4-day stay there. Then, from London, there's a direct flight to Copenhagen, which fits the 3-day stay requirement. \n\nAfter Copenhagen, flying to Tallinn is logical as they have a direct connection, allowing for a 4-day visit. From Tallinn, the next direct flight is to Oslo, where the user plans to meet a friend. However, the user wants to spend 5 days in Oslo, but the friend is available between days 10-14. To make this work, I'll adjust the stay in Oslo to cover days 9-13, ensuring the meeting happens within the specified window.\n\nFrom Oslo, there's a direct flight to Nice, which is perfect since the user needs to attend a conference there on days 14 and 16. This allows a 3-day stay in Nice, fitting the conference dates.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n1. Mykonos (4 days)\n2. London (2 days)\n3. Copenhagen (3 days)\n4. Tallinn (4 days)\n5. Oslo (5 days)\n6. Nice (3 days)\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the user's requirements and uses the available direct flights effectively.\n</think>",
