They also want to spend 7 days in Seville and 4 days in Manchester. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the order of the cities. The user mentioned that they want to meet a friend in Stuttgart at the beginning, so it makes sense to start there. Stuttgart is set for days 1-6. \n\nNext, from Stuttgart, they need to go to another city. Since Seville is a longer stay (7 days), it makes sense to go there next. So, days 7-13 would be in Seville. \n\nFinally, they want to spend 4 days in Manchester. Since there's a direct flight from Seville to Manchester, that works out. So, days 14-17 would be in Manchester. \n\nWait, but the total days add up to 17, and the user only wants 15 days. Hmm, maybe I can adjust the days to fit better. If I start in Stuttgart for days 1-6, then Seville from 7-13 (7 days), and Manchester from 14-17 (4 days), that's 17 days. But the user wants 15 days. Maybe I can shorten the stay in Seville by one day, making it 6 days instead of 7, but the user specifically wants 7 days.
