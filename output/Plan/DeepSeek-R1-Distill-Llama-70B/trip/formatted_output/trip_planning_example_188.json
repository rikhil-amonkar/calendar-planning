The user has specified that they must attend a conference in Brussels on days 1 and 2, spend 5 days in Split, and stay in Barcelona for 7 days. The available direct flights are between Brussels and Barcelona, and between Barcelona and Split.\n\nFirst, I'll start with Brussels since the conference is on days 1 and 2. After the conference, the next logical step is to fly to Barcelona, as there's a direct flight. They want to spend 5 days in Split, so from Barcelona, they can fly directly to Split. Finally, after Split, they can return to Barcelona for the remaining 7 days.\n\nWait, but the user wants to spend 7 days in Barcelona. If I go Brussels -> Barcelona -> Split -> Barcelona, that would mean they're in Barcelona twice, which might not be ideal. Maybe a better flow is Brussels -> Split -> Barcelona, but there's no direct flight from Brussels to Split. So the only way is Brussels -> Barcelona, then Barcelona -> Split, and then back to Barcelona. But that would mean they're in Barcelona for 7 days, but split into two parts, which might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps they can go Brussels -> Split -> Barcelona, but since there's no direct flight from Brussels to Split, they might have to go through another city, which isn't allowed as per the problem statement. So the only feasible way is Brussels -> Barcelona -> Split -> Barcelona. I'll adjust the days accordingly to ensure they spend the correct number of days in each city without overlapping.\n</think>",
