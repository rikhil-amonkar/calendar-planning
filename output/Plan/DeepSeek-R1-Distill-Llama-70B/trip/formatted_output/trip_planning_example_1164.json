The user has provided specific details about their stays and events they need to attend, so I need to ensure the itinerary aligns with those requirements.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the cities and their required stay durations:\n- Reykjavik: 2 days\n- Stockholm: 2 days\n- Porto: 5 days\n- Nice: 3 days\n- Venice: 4 days\n- Vienna: 3 days\n- Split: 3 days\n- Copenhagen: 2 days\n\nNext, I'll note the specific events and their dates:\n- Meet a friend in Reykjavik between day 3 and 4.\n- Meet friends in Stockholm between day 4 and 5.\n- Attend a wedding in Porto between day 13 and 17.\n- Attend a workshop in Vienna between day 11 and 13.\n- Attend a wedding in Vienna, but it seems to overlap with the Porto event, so I'll need to adjust that.\n\nNow, I'll map out the days, ensuring that each city is visited for the required number of days and that events are attended as specified. I'll start with the earliest event, which is meeting a friend in Reykjavik around day 3-4. So, Reykjavik will be the first stop.\n\nAfter Reykjavik, the next event is in Stockholm around day 4-5, so I'll place Stockholm right after Reykjavik. Then, I'll move on to Nice, Venice, and Vienna, ensuring the workshop in Vienna is attended before heading to Porto for the wedding. Finally, I'll include Split and Copenhagen towards the end.\n\nI'll make sure the cities are connected via direct flights as per the provided list. Each transition should be feasible based on the direct flight routes given. I'll also ensure that the total days add up correctly and that there are no overlaps or scheduling conflicts.\n\nBy carefully arranging each city and event in chronological order, I can create a logical and efficient itinerary that meets all the user's requirements.\n</think>",
