            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this meeting scheduling problem. The user is an AI meeting planner visiting San Francisco and wants to meet as many friends as possible. They've provided travel distances between various locations and a set of constraints with specific people available at certain times and places.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the constraints. The user arrives at Union Square at 9:00 AM. They have four people to meet: Karen, Joseph, Sandra, and Nancy, each available at different times and locations.\n\nKaren is at Nob Hill from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. The user needs at least 30 minutes with her. Since the user arrives at 9:00 AM, the earliest they can meet Karen is at 9:15 PM, but that's quite late. However, considering travel times, maybe there's a way to fit it in earlier.\n\nJoseph is at Haight-Ashbury from 12:30 PM to 7:45 PM. They need 90 minutes together. That's a longer meeting, so scheduling this might be tricky, especially if other meetings are involved.\n\nSandra is at Chinatown from 7:15 AM to 7:15 PM. The user arrives at 9:00 AM, so there's a window from 9:00 AM to 7:15 PM. They need 75 minutes, which is manageable if scheduled appropriately.\n\nNancy is at Marina District from 11:00 AM to 8:15 PM. They need 105 minutes, which is a longer meeting. This might require careful planning to ensure enough time for travel and meeting.\n\nLooking at the travel distances, the user needs to move between locations. For example, from Union Square to Nob Hill is 9 minutes, Union Square to Chinatown is 7 minutes, etc. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping and ensuring the user can travel efficiently.\n\nI'll start by considering the earliest possible meetings. Sandra is available from 9:00 AM, which is when the user arrives. Meeting Sandra first makes sense because she's available early. Chinatown is close to Union Square, only 7 minutes away. Meeting Sandra for 75 minutes would take us from 9:00 AM to 10:15 AM. That leaves the rest of the day to schedule other meetings.\n\nNext, looking at Nancy at Marina District, available from 11:00 AM. The travel time from Chinatown to Marina District is 16 minutes, and from Marina District back to Union Square is 16 minutes. If the user leaves Chinatown at 10:15 AM, they can reach Marina District by 10:31 AM. But Nancy starts at 11:00 AM, so the earliest they can meet is at 11:00 AM. They need 105 minutes, so the meeting would end at 1:45 PM. This seems feasible.\n\nThen, considering Joseph at Haight-Ashbury from 12:30 PM. The user needs to travel from Marina District to Haight-Ashbury, which is 17 minutes. If they end the meeting with Nancy at 1:45 PM, they can leave Marina District by 2:00 PM, arriving at Haight-Ashbury by 2:17 PM. Joseph is available from 12:30 PM, so meeting him at 2:17 PM would fit within his schedule. They need 90 minutes, so the meeting would end at 3:07 PM.\n\nLastly, Karen at Nob Hill from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. The user needs to travel from Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill, which is 15 minutes. If they end the meeting at 3:07 PM, they can leave Haight-Ashbury by 3:22 PM, arriving at Nob Hill by 3:37 PM. Karen is available starting at 9:15 PM, but that's quite a long time later. However, the user has the rest of the day to manage.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. The user would have to travel from Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill at 3:37 PM, but Karen isn't available until 9:15 PM. There's a significant gap here. Maybe the user can't meet Karen unless they adjust their schedule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user should meet Karen earlier. But Karen is only available starting at 9:15 PM, which is after the user arrives at Union Square. However, the user can't be in two places at once, so maybe it's better to prioritize the longer meetings first.\n\nRe-evaluating, meeting Joseph for 90 minutes at 2:17 PM might be better scheduled earlier. If the user meets Joseph at 12:30 PM, they can have a longer meeting, but they need to travel from Union Square to Haight-Ashbury, which is 18 minutes. Starting at 12:30 PM, ending at 1:40 PM. Then, moving to Marina District for Nancy, starting at 1:40 PM, travel time 16 minutes, meeting until 2:40 PM. Then, back to Union Square, but that might be too much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Sandra first, then Nancy, then Joseph, and see if Karen can be squeezed in. But the travel times add up, and Karen's availability is late in the evening.\n\nPerhaps the optimal schedule is to meet Sandra, then Nancy, then Joseph, and see if Karen can be met the next day, but the user is only visiting for the day. So, maybe it's not possible to meet all four. Therefore, the best plan is to meet Sandra, Nancy, and Joseph, and perhaps adjust the order to maximize the number of meetings.\n\nWait, the user's goal is to meet as many friends as possible. So, maybe meeting Karen is possible if the user can adjust their schedule to be at Nob Hill by 9:15 PM. Let's see:\n\n- After meeting Sandra until 10:15 AM, then travel to Marina District by 10:31 AM, meet Nancy until 1:45 PM. Then travel to Haight-Ashbury by 2:17 PM, meet Joseph until 3:07 PM. Then, travel back to Union Square by 3:37 PM, but that's too early for Karen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Joseph earlier. If the user meets Joseph at 12:30 PM, that's 90 minutes, ending at 1:40 PM. Then, go to Marina District, meet Nancy from 1:40 PM to 2:40 PM. Then, go to Nob Hill, but travel from Marina District to Nob Hill is 12 minutes, so arrive at 2:52 PM. Karen is available from 9:15 PM, so that's too early. Alternatively, maybe the user can't meet Karen if they have to be at Nob Hill by 9:15 PM.\n\nTherefore, it's better to meet Karen if possible, but the user might not have time. Alternatively, perhaps the user can meet Karen in the evening after other meetings.\n\nWait, the user can't be in two places at once. So, perhaps the best approach is to meet the maximum number of people without missing any.\n\nGiven the constraints, the user can meet Sandra, Nancy, and Joseph, but not Karen, because Karen is available only in the evening, and the user would need to travel from Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill, which is 15 minutes, but that would take time away from other meetings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can meet Karen first, but she's only available starting at 9:15 PM, which is after the user arrives. So, perhaps the user can't meet Karen at all.\n\nWait, the user arrives at 9:00 AM, but Karen is available from 9:15 PM. That's a 12-hour window. The user can't be in two places at once, so if they want to meet Karen, they need to schedule it in the evening after other meetings.\n\nBut considering the other friends, maybe it's better to meet as many as possible. So, the plan would be:\n\n1. Meet Sandra at Chinatown from 9:00 AM to 10:15 AM.\n2. Travel to Marina District, meet Nancy from 11:00 AM to 1:45 PM.\n3. Travel to Haight-Ashbury, meet Joseph from 2:17 PM to 3:07 PM.\n4. Travel back to Union Square, but that's too early for Karen.\n5. Alternatively, adjust the order to meet Joseph earlier, then Nancy, then Sandra, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Karen in the evening after meeting others.\n\nWait, but the user needs to be at Union Square at 9:00 AM, and Karen is at Nob Hill from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. So, if the user can get to Nob Hill by 9:15 PM, they can meet Karen. But the user would need to travel from their last meeting location to Nob Hill.\n\nIf the user meets Sandra first, then Nancy, then Joseph, and then travels to Nob Hill, but that would require leaving Haight-Ashbury at 3:07 PM, arriving at Nob Hill by 3:22 PM, but Karen isn't available until 9:15 PM. So, the user would have to wait at Nob Hill from 3:22 PM to 9:15 PM, which is 5 hours and 53 minutes. That's not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, if the user meets Karen first, but she's only available starting at 9:15 PM. So, the user can't meet her until after 9:15 PM. But the user arrives at 9:00 AM, so they have to be at Union Square by then. They can't be elsewhere at 9:00 AM.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to meet Karen if the user wants to meet others. So, the best plan is to meet Sandra, Nancy, and Joseph, and forgo meeting Karen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can meet Karen and one other person. For example, meet Karen at 9:15 PM, but that would require ending other meetings early to travel to Nob Hill.\n\nBut considering the travel times, it's not feasible to meet Karen and another person because of the time constraints.\n\nTherefore, the optimal plan is to meet Sandra, Nancy, and Joseph, and not meet Karen, as meeting her would require sacrificing one of the other meetings.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Sandra at Chinatown from 9:00 AM to 10:15 AM.\n2. Travel to Marina District, meet Nancy from 11:00 AM to 1:45 PM.\n3. Travel to Haight-Ashbury, meet Joseph from 2:17 PM to 3:07 PM.\n\nThis way, the user meets three friends, which is the maximum possible given the constraints.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"person\": \"Sandra\", \"start_time\": \"9:00\", \"end_time\": \"10:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"Nancy\", \"start_time\": \"11:00\", \"end_time\": \"1:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"2:17\", \"end_time\": \"3:07\"}\n  ]\n}",
