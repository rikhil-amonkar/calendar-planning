            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to schedule my meetings for the day in San Francisco. I've got this AI planner tool, but I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me see what I have here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the travel distances between locations. The distances provided are between Sunset District and Golden Gate Park, as well as the reverse. Sunset District to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes, and Golden Gate Park to Sunset District is 10 minutes. That seems straightforward enough.\n\nNow, looking at the constraints, I arrive at Sunset District at 9:00 AM. Joshua will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM. I need to meet Joshua for at least 15 minutes. So, I need to figure out a time when both Joshua and I are available at either Sunset District or Golden Gate Park.\n\nSince Joshua is at Golden Gate Park from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM, and I'm at Sunset District at 9:00 AM, there's a time difference here. I need to see if there's an overlap where I can travel to Golden Gate Park to meet him.\n\nLet me calculate the travel time from Sunset District to Golden Gate Park. It's 11 minutes. If I leave Sunset District at 9:00 AM, I can arrive at Golden Gate Park by 9:11 AM. But Joshua isn't there until 8:45 PM. That's a long wait. Alternatively, maybe I can schedule the meeting at Sunset District, but Joshua is not there in the morning.\n\nWait, maybe I can meet Joshua somewhere in between. Let's see, if I leave Sunset District at 8:45 PM, it would take 11 minutes to reach Golden Gate Park. But Joshua arrives there at 8:45 PM. So, if I leave Sunset District by 8:34 PM, I can arrive at Golden Gate Park just as Joshua arrives at 8:45 PM. That way, we can meet for exactly 15 minutes.\n\nSo, my plan is to leave Sunset District at 8:34 PM to arrive at Golden Gate Park at 8:45 PM, meet Joshua for 15 minutes until 9:00 PM, and then return to Sunset District by 9:11 PM. This way, I maximize the time I can spend with Joshua.\n\nWait, but is this feasible? Let me double-check the travel times. Sunset District to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes, and back is another 11 minutes. So, leaving at 8:34 PM allows me to be at Golden Gate Park by 8:45 PM, which is when Joshua arrives. We can meet from 8:45 PM to 9:00 PM, and then I can return to Sunset District by 9:11 PM.\n\nThat seems to work. But I need to make sure I don't miss the window. If I leave any later than 8:34 PM, I might not make it in time. Also, I should consider if there are any other constraints or if I need to adjust the meeting location based on availability.\n\nAnother thought: Is there a better time to meet? Since Joshua is only available from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM, and I'm at Sunset District in the morning, the only feasible way is to travel to Golden Gate Park in the evening. There's no overlapping time in the morning, so this seems like the best option.\n\nI should also consider the time it takes to travel back. If I meet Joshua at 9:00 PM, I need to leave Golden Gate Park by 9:15 PM to return to Sunset District by 9:26 PM, which is after Joshua has left. But since I only need 15 minutes, meeting until 9:00 PM should be sufficient.\n\nIn summary, my plan is to:\n\n1. Leave Sunset District at 8:34 PM.\n2. Arrive at Golden Gate Park at 8:45 PM.\n3. Meet Joshua from 8:45 PM to 9:00 PM.\n4. Return to Sunset District by 9:11 PM.\n\nThis way, I can meet Joshua for the required 15 minutes without missing the opportunity. I think this is the most efficient schedule considering the travel times and constraints provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"08:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
