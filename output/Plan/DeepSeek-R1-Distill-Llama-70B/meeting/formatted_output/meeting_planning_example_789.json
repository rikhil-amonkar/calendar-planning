            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user is an AI meeting planner trying to schedule a day of meetings in San Francisco. The goal is to maximize the number of friends met, considering travel times and constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The user arrives at Union Square at 9:00 AM. Each friend has specific time windows and locations where they can be met, along with the minimum meeting duration. The challenge is to fit these meetings into the day without overlapping and respecting travel times.\n\nLooking at the constraints, there are eight friends to meet, each with their own location and time windows. The user needs to plan the meetings in a way that maximizes efficiency, minimizing travel time between meetings.\n\nI'll start by listing all the friends and their availability:\n\n1. Betty at Russian Hill from 7:00 AM to 4:45 PM.\n2. Melissa at Alamo Square from 9:30 AM to 5:15 PM.\n3. Joshua at Haight-Ashbury from 12:15 PM to 7:00 PM.\n4. Jeffrey at Marina District from 12:15 PM to 6:00 PM.\n5. James at Bayview from 7:30 AM to 8:00 PM.\n6. Anthony at Chinatown from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM.\n7. Timothy at Presidio from 12:30 PM to 2:45 PM.\n8. Emily at Sunset District from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM.\n\nThe user starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM. The first thought is to meet someone nearby to save travel time. James is at Bayview from 7:30 AM to 8:00 PM. The travel distance from Union Square to Bayview is 15 minutes. Meeting James early might be efficient, but his availability starts at 7:30 AM, which is before the user arrives. So, the earliest possible meeting with James is at 9:00 AM.\n\nWait, the user arrives at 9:00 AM, so meeting James at 9:00 AM would work because James is available from 7:30 AM onwards. That's a good start.\n\nAfter meeting James, the next earliest friend available is Anthony at Chinatown from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM. The travel distance from Bayview to Chinatown is 19 minutes. So, from 9:00 AM to 11:45 AM, the user can travel from Bayview to Chinatown, arriving at 11:19 AM, which is before Anthony starts. So, the meeting can be scheduled at 11:45 AM.\n\nNext, after Chinatown, the user can go to Presidio to meet Timothy, who is available from 12:30 PM to 2:45 PM. The distance from Chinatown to Presidio is 19 minutes. Meeting Timothy at 12:30 PM fits well within his availability.\n\nAfter Presidio, the next option is Melissa at Alamo Square, available from 9:30 AM to 5:15 PM. The user can travel from Presidio to Alamo Square, which is 19 minutes. Meeting Melissa at 2:45 PM fits within her availability.\n\nThen, the user can go to Haight-Ashbury to meet Joshua, available from 12:15 PM to 7:00 PM. The distance from Alamo Square to Haight-Ashbury is 5 minutes. Meeting Joshua at 3:45 PM works.\n\nAfter Haight-Ashbury, the user can go to Marina District to meet Jeffrey, available from 12:15 PM to 6:00 PM. The distance from Haight-Ashbury to Marina District is 16 minutes. Meeting Jeffrey at 4:45 PM fits within his availability.\n\nFinally, the user can go to Sunset District to meet Emily, available from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM. The distance from Marina District to Sunset District is 19 minutes. Meeting Emily at 6:15 PM is possible, but she's available until 9:30 PM, so this meeting is feasible.\n\nHowever, I need to check the travel times between each meeting to ensure they are feasible. The user must have enough time to travel between locations without overlapping meeting times.\n\nWait, after meeting Jeffrey at 4:45 PM, the next meeting is with Emily at 6:15 PM. The travel time from Marina District to Sunset District is 19 minutes, so the user can make it.\n\nBut let's double-check the timeline:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Meet James at Bayview.\n- 11:45 AM: Meet Anthony at Chinatown.\n- 12:30 PM: Meet Timothy at Presidio.\n- 2:45 PM: Meet Melissa at Alamo Square.\n- 3:45 PM: Meet Joshua at Haight-Ashbury.\n- 4:45 PM: Meet Jeffrey at Marina District.\n- 6:15 PM: Meet Emily at Sunset District.\n\nThis schedule seems tight but possible. However, I need to ensure that the user can travel between locations without exceeding the meeting durations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better order to meet more friends, but since all friends are already included, this seems like the maximum number of meetings possible given the constraints.\n\nI think this plan works, but I should verify each travel time to make sure the user has enough time between meetings.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Bayview\", \"person\": \"James\", \"start_time\": \"09:00\", \"end_time\": \"09:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"person\": \"Anthony\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"12:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Presidio\", \"person\": \"Timothy\", \"start_time\": \"12:30\", \"end_time\": \"14:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Melissa\", \"start_time\": \"14:30\", \"end_time\": \"15:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\", \"person\": \"Joshua\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"16:30\", \"end_time\": \"17:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Sunset District\", \"person\": \"Emily\", \"start_time\": \"17:15\", \"end_time\": \"18:15\"}\n  ]\n}",
