            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help plan a meeting schedule for someone visiting San Francisco. They want to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and constraints. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I see the user provided a lot of travel distances between various locations. That's helpful. They also listed constraints with specific people available at certain times and locations. My goal is to create an itinerary that fits all these constraints while maximizing the number of meetings.\n\nStarting with the constraints: the user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. So, all meetings should start from there or after that time. Let's look at who's available when.\n\nLaura is at The Castro from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM. That's a window in the evening. Since the user arrives at 9 AM, the latest they can meet Laura is 9:30 PM, but Laura is available until 9:30 PM. So, maybe a meeting around 8:30 PM would work, but that's a bit tight considering travel time.\n\nDaniel is at Golden Gate Park from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. That's another evening slot. The user would need to travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park, which takes 25 minutes. So, they'd have to leave Fisherman's Wharf by 9:20 PM to arrive by 9:45 PM. That's doable.\n\nWilliam is at Embarcadero from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM. That's a morning slot, but the user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. Maybe they can meet William just before 9:00 AM, but the user might not have enough time to travel there. Alternatively, they could meet William at Fisherman's Wharf before heading out.\n\nKaren is at Russian Hill from 2:30 PM to 7:45 PM. That's a long window in the afternoon and evening. The user can potentially meet her after other meetings.\n\nStephanie is at Nob Hill from 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM. That's another morning slot. The user could meet her at Nob Hill before heading to other locations.\n\nJoseph is at Alamo Square from 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM. That's a short window in the morning. The user might need to prioritize this meeting.\n\nKimberly is at North Beach from 3:45 PM to 7:15 PM. That's a late afternoon to evening slot. The user can meet her after other meetings.\n\nNow, considering the travel times, I need to ensure that the user can move between locations without exceeding their schedule. Starting with the earliest available meetings in the morning seems logical.\n\nStephanie is at Nob Hill from 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM. If the user goes to Nob Hill right away, they can meet her before 9:30 AM. Nob Hill is 11 minutes from Fisherman's Wharf, so that's manageable.\n\nNext, Joseph is at Alamo Square from 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM. The user would need to travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square, which takes 20 minutes. They can leave Fisherman's Wharf at 11:00 AM to arrive by 11:30 AM, but they need to meet Joseph until 12:45 PM. So, meeting him around 11:30 AM seems feasible.\n\nAfter that, Karen is at Russian Hill from 2:30 PM to 7:45 PM. The user can go to Russian Hill after Alamo Square. The travel time from Alamo Square to Russian Hill is 13 minutes. They can leave Alamo Square around 12:45 PM to arrive by 1:00 PM, but Karen is available from 2:30 PM. So, maybe after a break or another meeting.\n\nWilliam is at Embarcadero from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM. If the user meets Stephanie at Nob Hill by 9:30 AM, they might have time to go to Embarcadero before 9:00 AM. However, the travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero is only 6 minutes, so they can meet William just before 9:00 AM.\n\nFor Laura at The Castro, the user needs to leave Fisherman's Wharf by 8:30 PM to arrive by 9:30 PM. So, after meeting others, they can go to The Castro around 8:30 PM.\n\nDaniel is at Golden Gate Park from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. They can meet him after Laura, traveling from The Castro to Golden Gate Park, which takes 13 minutes. They need to leave The Castro by 9:45 PM, so meeting Daniel around 9:30 PM would work.\n\nLastly, Kimberly is at North Beach from 3:45 PM to 7:15 PM. The user can meet her after Karen, traveling from Russian Hill to North Beach, which takes 23 minutes. They can leave Russian Hill around 3:45 PM to arrive by 4:15 PM, fitting within Kimberly's availability.\n\nPutting it all together, the user's day would be packed but doable, moving between locations efficiently to meet as many friends as possible within the constraints.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Nob Hill\", \"person\": \"Stephanie\", \"start_time\": \"07:30\", \"end_time\": \"08:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"11:30\", \"end_time\": \"12:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Russian Hill\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"14:00\", \"end_time\": \"15:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"William\", \"start_time\": \"08:30\", \"end_time\": \"09:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"The Castro\", \"person\": \"Laura\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"20:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Daniel\", \"start_time\": \"20:30\", \"end_time\": \"20:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Kimberly\", \"start_time\": \"16:00\", \"end_time\": \"17:00\"}\n  ]\n}",
