            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an AI meeting planner. They want to schedule a day of meetings in San Francisco, starting from Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the travel distances provided. They're quite detailed, which is helpful. I'll have to consider the time each meeting takes and how long it takes to travel between locations.\n\nThe constraints are crucial here. The user arrives at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM, so all meetings need to start after that. Each friend has specific time windows when they're available. For example, Stephanie is at Russian Hill from 8 PM to 8:45 PM, but the user arrives at 9 AM, so that's a bit tricky because there's a 12-hour gap. Maybe I can schedule a meeting when she's available in the evening, but the user needs to get there in time.\n\nKevin is at Fisherman's Wharf from 7:15 PM to 9:45 PM. That's a longer window, so that might be more flexible. Robert is at Nob Hill from 7:45 AM to 10:30 AM, which is early in the morning. Steven is at Golden Gate Park from 8:30 AM to 5 PM, which is a long block. Anthony is at Alamo Square from 7:45 AM to 7:45 PM, and Sandra is at Pacific Heights from 2:45 PM to 9:45 PM.\n\nI need to make sure that each meeting starts and ends within the person's available time and that the travel time between locations doesn't make the user late or cause overlaps.\n\nStarting with Robert, who's at Nob Hill from 7:45 AM to 10:30 AM. Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill is 15 minutes, so if the user leaves at 9 AM, they can arrive by 9:15 AM. But Robert is available until 10:30 AM, so a meeting from 9:15 to 10:00 AM seems feasible. That's 45 minutes, which meets the minimum requirement.\n\nNext, Anthony is at Alamo Square from 7:45 AM to 7:45 PM. Alamo Square is close to Haight-Ashbury, only 5 minutes away. Maybe a quick meeting right after Robert? But Anthony's availability is all day, so maybe it's better to schedule later if there are more people with earlier slots.\n\nSteven is at Golden Gate Park until 5 PM. It's a 7-minute walk from Haight-Ashbury. Perhaps a longer meeting here since he's available all day. But the user might want to spread out the meetings.\n\nStephanie is at Russian Hill from 8 PM to 8:45 PM. That's in the evening. The user would need to travel from their current location to Russian Hill, which is 17 minutes from Haight-Ashbury. So maybe after some other meetings.\n\nKevin is at Fisherman's Wharf from 7:15 PM to 9:45 PM. That's a later slot, but maybe after other evening meetings.\n\nSandra is at Pacific Heights from 2:45 PM to 9:45 PM. Pacific Heights is 12 minutes away. She's available for 7 hours, which is a long time, so maybe a longer meeting here.\n\nI also need to consider the travel times between these locations. For example, going from Haight-Ashbury to Russian Hill is 17 minutes, but coming back might take longer if there's traffic or other meetings.\n\nI think a possible schedule could be:\n\n1. Meet Robert at Nob Hill early in the morning.\n2. Then go to Alamo Square for a quick meeting with Anthony.\n3. Travel to Golden Gate Park for a longer meeting with Steven.\n4. After lunch, go to Pacific Heights for a meeting with Sandra.\n5. Finally, in the evening, go to Fisherman's Wharf for Kevin and then to Russian Hill for Stephanie.\n\nI need to check the travel times and ensure that each meeting starts and ends within the available window. Also, making sure the user doesn't have back-to-back meetings that are too close, allowing for travel time.\n\nWait, but the user might want to maximize the number of meetings. Maybe I can fit in more if the travel times are manageable. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Steven at Golden Gate Park, the user can go to Marina District or another nearby area, but the constraints don't mention those. So perhaps sticking to the given locations is better.\n\nI also need to make sure that each meeting is at least the required minimum time. For example, Robert's meeting is 45 minutes, which is good, but Anthony's is only 15 minutes, so it's important to schedule that efficiently.\n\nOverall, the key is to start with the earliest available slots, ensuring the user can travel and meet without overlapping, and then fill in the rest of the day with as many meetings as possible within the constraints.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Nob Hill\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"09:15\", \"end_time\": \"10:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Anthony\", \"start_time\": \"10:05\", \"end_time\": \"10:20\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Steven\", \"start_time\": \"10:30\", \"end_time\": \"11:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\", \"person\": \"Sandra\", \"start_time\": \"12:45\", \"end_time\": \"13:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"Kevin\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Russian Hill\", \"person\": \"Stephanie\", \"start_time\": \"17:00\", \"end_time\": \"17:15\"}\n  ]\n}",
