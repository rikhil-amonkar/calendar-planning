            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help this AI planning tool create a meeting schedule for the day in San Francisco. The user has given a lot of travel distances and constraints, so I need to carefully consider all of them to optimize the schedule.\n\nFirst, let's look at the constraints. The user arrives at Chinatown at 9:00 AM. They have several meetings scheduled throughout the day with different people at various locations. Each meeting has a minimum time requirement, so I need to make sure each meeting fits within that time frame without overlapping too much.\n\nStarting with the first constraint: David will be at Mission District from 8:00 AM to 7:45 PM. The user wants to meet David for at least 45 minutes. So, the earliest they can meet is at 8:00 AM, but since they arrive at Chinatown at 9:00 AM, the meeting needs to be scheduled after 9:00 AM. Maybe around 9:30 AM.\n\nNext, Kenneth will be at Alamo Square from 2:00 PM to 7:45 PM. They need to meet for 120 minutes. So, the latest they can start is 2:00 PM, but considering their schedule, maybe around 3:00 PM.\n\nJohn will be at Pacific Heights from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. They need only 15 minutes, so that's manageable. Maybe around 5:15 PM.\n\nCharles will be at Union Square from 9:45 PM to 10:45 PM. They need 60 minutes, so around 9:45 PM.\n\nDeborah will be at Golden Gate Park from 7:00 AM to 6:15 PM. They need 90 minutes. Since they arrive at Chinatown at 9:00 AM, maybe they can meet Deborah at Golden Gate Park in the morning, around 9:30 AM.\n\nKaren will be at Sunset District from 5:45 PM to 9:15 PM. They need 15 minutes, so maybe around 6:00 PM.\n\nCarol will be at Presidio from 8:15 AM to 9:15 AM. They need 30 minutes. Since Carol is only there until 9:15 AM, the meeting should be scheduled around 9:00 AM.\n\nNow, considering the travel times, I need to make sure the user can travel between these locations efficiently. Starting from Chinatown, they can go to Presidio, then to Alamo Square, Golden Gate Park, Sunset District, and back to Union Square.\n\nLet me outline a possible itinerary:\n\n1. **Chinatown**: Arrive at 9:00 AM. Can meet Carol at Presidio, but since Carol is only there until 9:15 AM, maybe it's better to meet someone else nearby.\n\n2. **Golden Gate Park**: Deborah is there from 7:00 AM to 6:15 PM. They can meet her around 9:30 AM for 90 minutes.\n\n3. **Mission District**: David is there from 8:00 AM to 7:45 PM. They can meet him around 9:30 AM for 45 minutes.\n\n4. **Alamo Square**: Kenneth is there from 2:00 PM to 7:45 PM. They can meet him around 3:00 PM for 120 minutes.\n\n5. **Pacific Heights**: John is there from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. They can meet him around 5:15 PM for 15 minutes.\n\n6. **Sunset District**: Karen is there from 5:45 PM to 9:15 PM. They can meet her around 6:00 PM for 15 minutes.\n\n7. **Union Square**: Charles is there from 9:45 PM to 10:45 PM. They can meet him around 9:45 PM for 60 minutes.\n\nThis seems to fit all the constraints and allows the user to meet as many friends as possible without too much travel time. I need to make sure the travel times between these locations are manageable and that the user can move from one place to another without significant delays.\n\nLet me check the travel distances:\n\n- Chinatown to Golden Gate Park: 23 minutes.\n- Golden Gate Park to Mission District: 17 minutes.\n- Mission District to Alamo Square: 11 minutes.\n- Alamo Square to Pacific Heights: 10 minutes.\n- Pacific Heights to Sunset District: 21 minutes.\n- Sunset District to Union Square: 30 minutes.\n- Union Square to Chinatown: 7 minutes.\n\nThis looks feasible. The user can move from Chinatown to Golden Gate Park, then to Mission District, Alamo Square, Pacific Heights, Sunset District, and back to Union Square.\n\nNow, let's structure the itinerary:\n\n- **Golden Gate Park**: Meet Deborah from 9:30 AM to 10:20 AM.\n- **Mission District**: Meet David from 10:20 AM to 11:05 AM.\n- **Alamo Square**: Meet Kenneth from 11:30 AM to 12:50 PM.\n- **Pacific Heights**: Meet John from 1:15 PM to 1:30 PM.\n- **Sunset District**: Meet Karen from 2:15 PM to 2:30 PM.\n- **Union Square**: Meet Charles from 9:45 PM to 10:45 PM.\n\nThis schedule allows the user to meet all friends without too much backtracking, considering the travel times provided. I think this should work well.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Deborah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:20\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:20\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:05\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:50\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"John\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Sunset District\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Charles\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
