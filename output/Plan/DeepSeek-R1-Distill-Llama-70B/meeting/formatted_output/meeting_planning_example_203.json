            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to help this user schedule their meetings in San Francisco. They've given me a series of constraints and travel distances, and I need to figure out the best itinerary. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the user arrives at Financial District at 9:00 AM. They need to meet several friends, each located in different areas of the city. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings while considering travel times and the constraints provided.\n\nLooking at the constraints, there are four people to meet: David at Fisherman's Wharf, Timothy at Pacific Heights, and Robert at Mission District. Each has specific time windows available.\n\nStarting with David at Fisherman's Wharf, who's available from 10:45 AM to 3:30 PM. Since I arrive at Financial District at 9:00 AM, I need to figure out the best time to travel to Fisherman's Wharf. The travel distance from Financial District to Fisherman's Wharf is 10 minutes, so I can get there by 9:10 AM. However, David isn't available until 10:45 AM, so I'll have to wait until then.\n\nNext, Timothy is at Pacific Heights from 9:00 AM to 3:30 PM. Pacific Heights is 13 minutes away from Financial District, so I can reach him by 9:13 AM. That gives me a good window to meet him early.\n\nRobert is at Mission District from 12:15 PM to 7:45 PM. Mission District is 17 minutes away, so I can go there after meeting David or Timothy.\n\nI need to plan the meetings in a way that minimizes backtracking and maximizes the use of time. Maybe start with Timothy in Pacific Heights, then go to Fisherman's Wharf for David, and then to Mission District for Robert.\n\nLet me check the travel times:\n\n- From Financial District to Pacific Heights: 13 minutes (9:00 AM arrival).\n- From Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf: 13 minutes (11:13 AM arrival).\n- From Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District: 22 minutes (12:35 PM arrival).\n\nThat seems doable. I can meet Timothy first, then David, and then Robert.\n\nAlternatively, I could meet Robert first, but his availability starts at 12:15 PM, which might be better after meeting Timothy.\n\nWait, if I meet Timothy at 9:00 AM, then go to Fisherman's Wharf by 9:10 AM, but David isn't available until 10:45 AM. So I can wait there until 10:45 AM, then go to Mission District after that.\n\nBut that might leave a long gap between meetings. Maybe it's better to meet David first, then Timothy, and then Robert.\n\nLet me outline the possible schedule:\n\n1. Meet Timothy at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf, arriving at 9:13 AM. Wait until 10:45 AM to meet David.\n3. After meeting David, travel to Mission District, arriving at 12:35 PM. Meet Robert from 12:15 PM, so that works.\n\nThis way, I'm using the time efficiently without too much waiting.\n\nAlternatively, if I meet David first:\n\n1. Meet David at Fisherman's Wharf at 10:45 AM.\n2. Travel to Pacific Heights, arriving at 10:58 AM. Meet Timothy until 3:30 PM.\n3. Then travel to Mission District, arriving at 12:35 PM. Meet Robert from 12:15 PM.\n\nThis also works, but meeting Timothy later might be better to avoid waiting.\n\nI think the first option is better because I can meet Timothy earlier, then proceed to Fisherman's Wharf without waiting too long.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n\n- Meet Timothy at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf, arriving at 9:13 AM. Wait until 10:45 AM to meet David.\n- After meeting David, travel to Mission District, arriving at 12:35 PM. Meet Robert from 12:15 PM.\n\nThis seems efficient, considering the travel times and constraints.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"Timothy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
