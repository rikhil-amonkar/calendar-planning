            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this meeting planning problem. The user is an AI trying to schedule meetings in San Francisco, aiming to meet as many friends as possible. They've provided a bunch of travel distances and specific constraints for each meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The user arrives at Bayview at 9:00 AM. There are four people to meet: Joseph, Nancy, Jason, and Jeffrey. Each has specific time windows and minimum meeting durations.\n\nStarting with Joseph, who's at Russian Hill from 8:30 AM to 7:15 PM. To meet him for at least 60 minutes, I need to find a time slot that fits within his availability. Since I arrive at Bayview at 9:00 AM, I can't meet him before that. I'll check the travel time from Bayview to Russian Hill, which is 23 minutes. If I leave Bayview at 9:00 AM, I can arrive at Russian Hill by 9:23 AM. But Joseph is available from 8:30 AM, so the earliest I can meet him is at 9:23 AM. However, I need a 60-minute meeting. So, the latest I can start is 6:23 PM to end at 7:23 PM, but Joseph's latest meeting time is 7:15 PM. So the latest I can start is 7:00 PM, but that might be too late considering travel times.\n\nWait, maybe I can meet him earlier. If I leave Bayview at 8:37 AM, I'd arrive at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM. That's perfect because Joseph is available from 8:30 AM. So I can meet him from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, which is a 60-minute meeting. That works.\n\nNext, Nancy is at Alamo Square from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM. I need to meet her for 90 minutes. The travel time from Bayview to Alamo Square is 16 minutes. If I leave Bayview at 10:44 AM, I'll arrive at Alamo Square by 11:00 AM. That gives me a 60-minute meeting slot, but I need 90 minutes. So I should leave a bit earlier. If I leave Bayview at 10:00 AM, I arrive at 10:16 AM, but Nancy isn't available until 11:00 AM. So the earliest I can meet her is at 11:00 AM, but I need 90 minutes. So I can meet her from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, which is 90 minutes. That works.\n\nThen, Jason is at North Beach from 4:45 PM to 9:45 PM. I need to meet him for 15 minutes. The travel time from Bayview to North Beach is 21 minutes. If I leave Bayview at 4:39 PM, I arrive at 5:00 PM, which is within Jason's availability. So I can meet him from 5:00 PM to 5:15 PM, which is perfect.\n\nLastly, Jeffrey is at Financial District from 10:30 AM to 3:45 PM. I need to meet him for 45 minutes. The travel time from Bayview to Financial District is 19 minutes. If I leave Bayview at 10:11 AM, I arrive at 10:30 AM, which is when Jeffrey is available. So I can meet him from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM, which is 45 minutes. That fits.\n\nNow, I need to make sure the travel times and meeting durations don't overlap. Let's check the timings:\n\n- Meeting Joseph at Russian Hill from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM.\n- Then, leaving Russian Hill at 10:00 AM, traveling back to Bayview, which takes 23 minutes, arriving at 10:23 AM.\n- Next, meeting Nancy at Alamo Square from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM.\n- After that, leaving Alamo Square at 1:00 PM, traveling back to Bayview, which takes 16 minutes, arriving at 1:16 PM.\n- Then, meeting Jason at North Beach from 4:45 PM to 5:00 PM.\n- After that, leaving North Beach at 5:00 PM, traveling back to Bayview, which takes 21 minutes, arriving at 5:21 PM.\n- Finally, meeting Jeffrey at Financial District from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM. Wait, but I can't be in two places at once. Oh, I see a problem here. Jeffrey's meeting time is from 10:30 AM to 3:45 PM, but I can't meet him until after I've met the others. So maybe I should adjust the order.\n\nPerhaps I should meet Jeffrey first. If I leave Bayview at 10:11 AM, arrive at Financial District at 10:30 AM, meet Jeffrey from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM, then go to Russian Hill, arriving at 11:23 AM, meet Joseph from 11:23 AM to 12:23 PM, then back to Bayview, arriving at 12:23 PM. Then, go to Alamo Square, arriving at 12:38 PM, meet Nancy from 12:38 PM to 2:38 PM, then back to Bayview, arriving at 2:38 PM. Then, go to North Beach, arriving at 3:39 PM, meet Jason from 3:39 PM to 4:00 PM, then back to Bayview, arriving at 4:00 PM.\n\nWait, but Jason is available until 9:45 PM, so meeting him at 3:39 PM to 4:00 PM is fine. Then, after that, I can go to Alamo Square again if needed, but Nancy's meeting is already done. So this seems feasible.\n\nSo the optimized itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Jeffrey at Financial District from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM.\n2. Travel to Russian Hill, arrive at 11:23 AM, meet Joseph from 11:23 AM to 12:23 PM.\n3. Return to Bayview, arrive at 12:23 PM.\n4. Travel to Alamo Square, arrive at 12:38 PM, meet Nancy from 12:38 PM to 2:38 PM.\n5. Return to Bayview, arrive at 2:38 PM.\n6. Travel to North Beach, arrive at 3:39 PM, meet Jason from 3:39 PM to 4:00 PM.\n7. Return to Bayview, arrive at 4:00 PM.\n\nThis way, all meetings are scheduled without overlapping and within the required time constraints.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:23\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:23\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:38\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:38\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:39\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
