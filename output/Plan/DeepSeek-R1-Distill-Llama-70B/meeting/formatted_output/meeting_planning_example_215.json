            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user has provided a series of travel distance data and constraints, and they want me to schedule their day optimally to meet as many friends as possible. They've given several examples of previous responses, so I can use those as a reference.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The user arrives at Bayview at 9:00 AM. They need to meet Jessica, Sandra, and Jason. Each has specific time windows and minimum meeting durations.\n\nJessica is at Embarcadero from 4:45 PM to 7:00 PM, and she needs at least 30 minutes. Sandra is at Richmond District from 6:30 PM to 9:45 PM, requiring 120 minutes. Jason is at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM, also needing 30 minutes.\n\nI need to figure out the best time to meet each person without overlapping too much and ensuring the travel times are considered.\n\nStarting with Jason, who's at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM. Meeting him early might be better since he's only available until 4:45. So, maybe schedule that meeting first.\n\nNext, Jessica is available from 4:45 PM to 7:00 PM at Embarcadero. If I meet Jason at 4:00 PM, then maybe I can meet Jessica right after he finishes at 4:45 PM. But I need to check the travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero. The distance is 8 minutes, which is manageable.\n\nThen, Sandra is at Richmond District from 6:30 PM to 9:45 PM. If I meet Jessica at 4:45 PM, I have time to go from Embarcadero to Richmond District. The distance is 19 minutes, which is feasible. I can meet Sandra at 6:30 PM, but I need to make sure the meeting duration is 120 minutes. That might be tight because she's available until 9:45 PM, but I can adjust the meeting time to fit.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's a better schedule. If I meet Jason at 4:00 PM, then Jessica at 4:45 PM, and then Sandra at 6:30 PM, that might work. Let me calculate the travel times:\n\n- Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero: 8 minutes.\n- Embarcadero to Richmond District: 19 minutes.\n\nThat's a total of 27 minutes between meetings. That's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, could I meet Sandra earlier? She's available from 6:30 PM, but if I meet her at 6:30 PM, I have enough time to travel back if needed. However, since she needs 120 minutes, it's better to meet her later in her window to allow enough time.\n\nAlso, considering the travel times, I need to ensure that I can move between locations without causing delays.\n\nSo, the plan would be:\n\n1. Meet Jason at Fisherman's Wharf at 4:00 PM for 30 minutes.\n2. Travel to Embarcadero, arriving by 4:08 PM.\n3. Meet Jessica at 4:45 PM for 30 minutes.\n4. Travel to Richmond District, arriving by 5:07 PM.\n5. Meet Sandra at 6:30 PM for 120 minutes.\n\nThis schedule allows enough time between meetings and accommodates all the required durations. I think this works.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Richmond District\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
