            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help this user create a meeting schedule for their day in San Francisco. They've provided a lot of constraints and travel distances, so I need to consider all that to make the best itinerary.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the constraints. The user arrives at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. They have several friends to meet, each with specific locations and time windows. My goal is to maximize the number of meetings while respecting the travel times and the minimum meeting durations.\n\nStarting with the earliest possible meeting, I see that Stephanie is at the Mission District from 8:15 AM to 1:45 PM. Since the user is at Haight-Ashbury, I need to calculate the travel time to Mission District. The distance from Haight-Ashbury to Mission District is 11 minutes. If the user leaves at 9:00 AM, they can arrive by 9:11 AM, which is before Stephanie's 8:15 AM start time. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I misread the travel distance.\n\nLooking back, the travel distance from Haight-Ashbury to Mission District is 11 minutes. So, the user can reach Mission District by 9:11 AM. However, Stephanie is available from 8:15 AM. Since the user arrives later, the earliest they can meet is at 9:11 AM. But the user wants to meet for 90 minutes. If they start at 9:11, the meeting would end at 10:01 AM. That seems doable.\n\nNext, Sandra is at Bayview from 1:00 PM to 7:30 PM. The user needs to travel from Haight-Ashbury to Bayview, which takes 18 minutes. They can leave after meeting Stephanie, but they have to consider the time to get to Bayview. If they leave Haight-Ashbury at 10:01 AM, they'll arrive in Bayview by 10:19 AM. But Sandra isn't available until 1:00 PM. So, the user should plan to leave after their meeting with Stephanie and come back later.\n\nRichard is at Pacific Heights from 7:15 AM to 10:15 AM. The user needs to go from Haight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights, which is 12 minutes. If they leave at 9:00 AM, they can arrive by 9:12 AM, which is within Richard's availability. Meeting him for 75 minutes would end at 10:12 AM, allowing the user to proceed to other meetings.\n\nBrian is at Russian Hill from 12:15 PM to 4:00 PM. The trip from Haight-Ashbury to Russian Hill is 17 minutes. The user needs to leave after meeting Richard, perhaps around 10:15 AM, arrive by 10:32 AM. But Brian isn't available until 12:15 PM. So, the user might need to come back later or adjust the schedule.\n\nJason is at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:30 AM to 5:45 PM. The travel time from Haight-Ashbury is 23 minutes. If the user leaves at 9:00 AM, they can arrive by 9:23 AM, which is within Jason's availability. Meeting him for 60 minutes would end at 9:23 + 1 hour = 10:23 AM.\n\nNow, considering the user's arrival at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM, the initial plan could be:\n\n1. Meet Jason at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM.\n2. Return to Haight-Ashbury, then go to Pacific Heights to meet Richard from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM.\n3. Then proceed to Mission District to meet Stephanie from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM.\n4. After that, go to Bayview to meet Sandra from 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM.\n5. Finally, visit Russian Hill to meet Brian from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM.\n\nThis schedule respects the travel times and meeting constraints. However, the user needs to ensure they have enough time to travel between locations without being late or missing any meetings.\n\nWait, the user needs to start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. Meeting Jason first at Fisherman's Wharf seems efficient because it's nearby. Then, after returning, meeting Richard at Pacific Heights, which is a short trip. Then moving to Mission District, which is closer, and then to Bayview, which is a bit farther. Finally, to Russian Hill.\n\nI need to make sure the travel times between these locations are accounted for. Also, the user should have enough time between meetings to travel without rushing.\n\nAnother consideration is the time after meeting Brian. If they meet Brian until 4:00 PM, they might have the rest of the day free, but the user's goal is to meet as many friends as possible, so perhaps they can include more meetings if possible.\n\nAlternatively, the user might prioritize certain friends based on proximity or time availability. For example, meeting Richard early in the day might free up more time for other meetings.\n\nOverall, the proposed itinerary seems to cover all the necessary meetings without exceeding the user's travel capabilities. It might be a bit tight, but with careful planning, it should work.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
