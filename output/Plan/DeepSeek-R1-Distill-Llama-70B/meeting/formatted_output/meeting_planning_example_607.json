            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help this user plan their day in San Francisco. They've provided a lot of travel distances and specific constraints. Let me start by understanding their constraints first.\n\nThey arrive at Sunset District at 9:00 AM. The first thing I notice is that they have a limited number of meetings\u2014only four. So, I need to make sure each meeting is strategically scheduled to cover as much ground as possible without backtracking too much.\n\nLooking at the constraints, the first meeting is with Karen at Russian Hill from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM. Since Karen is only available in the evening, I should schedule that last. Russian Hill is a central location, so it's a good spot to end the day.\n\nNext, Jessica will be at The Castro from 3:45 PM to 7:30 PM. The Castro is a bit west, so I need to plan the afternoon around getting there. After that, Matthew is at Richmond District from 7:30 AM to 3:15 PM. Since Matthew is available in the morning, maybe I can meet him first thing after arriving. But considering the travel time, maybe it's better to meet him later in the morning after some other meetings.\n\nMichelle will be at Marina District from 10:30 AM to 6:45 PM. Marina District is close to Sunset District, so that's a logical second meeting. It's only a short walk from Sunset District, so that's efficient.\n\nCarol will be at North Beach from 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM. North Beach is a bit further west, but it's manageable. After that, Stephanie will be at Union Square from 10:45 AM to 2:15 PM. Union Square is near the heart of the city, so that's a good spot to meet someone in the afternoon.\n\nLinda will be at Golden Gate Park from 10:45 AM to 10:00 PM. Golden Gate Park is a bit of a drive, but it's a must-visit spot. It might be better to meet her in the late afternoon or early evening after other meetings.\n\nNow, considering the travel times between these locations, I need to ensure that the user doesn't spend too much time traveling, which would eat into their day. Starting at Sunset District, moving to Russian Hill in the evening seems feasible. Then, working my way back towards the city for the other meetings.\n\nI also need to consider the user's goal of meeting as many friends as possible, so minimizing travel and backtracking is key. Maybe starting with the furthest friend and working closer, but given the constraints, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAfter planning, I realize that starting with meeting Karen at Russian Hill in the evening makes sense. Then, moving to The Castro, then to Richmond District, Marina District, North Beach, Union Square, and finally Golden Gate Park. This way, the user can cover all the required meetings without too much backtracking.\n\nI need to make sure each meeting is scheduled in a logical order based on proximity. For example, after meeting Karen, the user can head to The Castro, then to Richmond District, then to Marina District, which are all relatively close. After that, moving to North Beach and Union Square makes sense, and ending at Golden Gate Park.\n\nI also need to check the travel times between each location to ensure it's efficient. From Sunset District to Russian Hill is about 24 minutes, which is manageable. Then, from Russian Hill to The Castro is 21 minutes. From there to Richmond District is 16 minutes, and so on.\n\nOverall, the plan balances the user's schedule, ensuring they meet all friends within the day without excessive travel. It's a bit tight, but it works given the constraints.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"The Castro\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Richmond District\",\n      \"person\": \"Matthew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Marina District\",\n      \"person\": \"Michelle\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Linda\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
