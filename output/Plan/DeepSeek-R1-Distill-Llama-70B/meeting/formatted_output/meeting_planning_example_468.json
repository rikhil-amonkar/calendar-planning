            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help plan a day of meetings in San Francisco for someone starting at The Castro at 9:00 AM. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel distances and constraints.\n\nFirst, I'll list the travel distances provided:\n\n- The Castro to Bayview: 19 minutes.\n- The Castro to Pacific Heights: 16 minutes.\n- The Castro to Alamo Square: 8 minutes.\n- The Castro to Fisherman's Wharf: 24 minutes.\n- The Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11 minutes.\n- Bayview to The Castro: 20 minutes.\n- Bayview to Pacific Heights: 23 minutes.\n- Bayview to Alamo Square: 16 minutes.\n- Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25 minutes.\n- Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 minutes.\n- Pacific Heights to The Castro: 16 minutes.\n- Pacific Heights to Bayview: 22 minutes.\n- Pacific Heights to Alamo Square: 10 minutes.\n- Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf: 13 minutes.\n- Pacific Heights to Golden Gate Park: 15 minutes.\n- Alamo Square to The Castro: 8 minutes.\n- Alamo Square to Bayview: 16 minutes.\n- Alamo Square to Pacific Heights: 10 minutes.\n- Alamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf: 19 minutes.\n- Alamo Square to Golden Gate Park: 9 minutes.\n- Fisherman's Wharf to The Castro: 26 minutes.\n- Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26 minutes.\n- Fisherman's Wharf to Pacific Heights: 12 minutes.\n- Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square: 20 minutes.\n- Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25 minutes.\n- Golden Gate Park to The Castro: 13 minutes.\n- Golden Gate Park to Bayview: 23 minutes.\n- Golden Gate Park to Pacific Heights: 16 minutes.\n- Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 10 minutes.\n- Golden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24 minutes.\n\nNow, looking at the constraints:\n\n1. **Rebecca** will be at Bayview from 9:00 AM to 12:45 PM. Need at least 90 minutes with her.\n2. **Amanda** will be at Pacific Heights from 6:30 PM to 9:45 PM. Need 90 minutes.\n3. **James** will be at Alamo Square from 9:45 AM to 9:15 PM. Need 90 minutes.\n4. **Sarah** will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00 AM to 9:30 PM. Need 90 minutes.\n5. **Melissa** will be at Golden Gate Park from 9:00 AM to 6:45 PM. Need 90 minutes.\n\nGiven these constraints, I need to plan the day to ensure that I can meet each person within their available time frames, considering the travel distances and ensuring that I don't have back-to-back meetings that are too tight.\n\nStarting at The Castro at 9:00 AM, here's a possible itinerary:\n\n1. **The Castro** to meet someone nearby first. Let's start with meeting **Melissa** at Golden Gate Park. It's an 11-minute trip from The Castro.\n\n   - **Golden Gate Park** from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM.\n\n2. Next, head to Fisherman's Wharf to meet **Sarah**. It's a 24-minute trip from Golden Gate Park.\n\n   - **Fisherman's Wharf** from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM.\n\n3. From Fisherman's Wharf, go to Alamo Square to meet **James**. It's a 20-minute trip.\n\n   - **Alamo Square** from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM.\n\n4. From Alamo Square, travel to Bayview to meet **Rebecca**. It's a 16-minute trip.\n\n   - **Bayview** from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM.\n\n5. From Bayview, head to Pacific Heights to meet **Amanda**. It's a 23-minute trip.\n\n   - **Pacific Heights** from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM.\n\n6. From Pacific Heights, travel back to The Castro to meet someone else, but considering the time, it might be better to end the day here.\n\nThis schedule allows meeting all the friends within their available time frames, considering the travel distances and the constraints. However, I need to ensure that each meeting starts and ends within the required times.\n\nIf I need to adjust, I can swap the order of meetings to better fit the travel times, but this initial plan seems feasible.\n\nFinal itinerary:\n\n1. **Golden Gate Park** to meet Melissa from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM.\n2. **Fisherman's Wharf** to meet Sarah from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM.\n3. **Alamo Square** to meet James from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM.\n4. **Bayview** to meet Rebecca from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM.\n5. **Pacific Heights** to meet Amanda from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM.\n\nThis plan efficiently uses the travel distances and meets each friend within the required time frames.\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"James\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"Amanda\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
