            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help schedule a day of meetings in San Francisco for someone who's visiting. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering the travel times and constraints given. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the travel distances between different locations. There's a list provided, which is pretty extensive. It includes times from Presidio to various neighborhoods like Marina District, The Castro, Fisherman's Wharf, Bayview, Pacific Heights, Mission District, Alamo Square, and Golden Gate Park. Each of these has a specific travel time in minutes.\n\nNow, looking at the constraints, the user arrives at Presidio at 9:00 AM. They have several friends in different locations with specific time windows when they're available. The goal is to meet each friend for a minimum amount of time, so I need to ensure that the meetings are scheduled within these windows and that the travel time between meetings is manageable.\n\nThe first friend to consider is Amanda, who's at the Marina District from 2:45 PM to 7:30 PM. She needs a 105-minute meeting. Since the user is starting at Presidio, I should check the travel time from Presidio to Marina District, which is 11 minutes. That seems quick enough, so maybe the user can go to Marina District first.\n\nNext, Melissa is at The Castro from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM. She needs a 30-minute meeting. The Castro is close to Presidio, with a travel time of 21 minutes. Since Melissa is available early in the morning, maybe the user can meet her right after arriving.\n\nJeffrey is at Fisherman's Wharf from 12:45 PM to 6:45 PM, requiring a 120-minute meeting. Fisherman's Wharf is 19 minutes away from Presidio. He's available in the afternoon, so the user could meet him after the morning meetings.\n\nMatthew is at Bayview from 10:15 AM to 1:15 PM, needing a 30-minute meeting. Bayview is 31 minutes away from Presidio. Since he's available in the morning, perhaps the user can meet him before heading to other locations.\n\nNancy is at Pacific Heights from 5:00 PM to 9:30 PM, requiring a 105-minute meeting. Pacific Heights is 11 minutes from Presidio. She's available in the evening, so the user might want to meet her later in the day.\n\nKaren is at Mission District from 5:30 PM to 8:30 PM, needing a 105-minute meeting. The Mission District is 26 minutes away from Presidio. She's available in the late afternoon and evening.\n\nRobert is at Alamo Square from 11:15 AM to 5:30 PM, needing a 120-minute meeting. Alamo Square is 19 minutes away from Presidio. He's available in the morning and early afternoon, so the user could meet him after the morning meetings.\n\nJoseph is at Golden Gate Park from 8:30 AM to 9:15 PM, requiring a 105-minute meeting. Golden Gate Park is 12 minutes away from Presidio. He's available all day, so the user could meet him early on.\n\nNow, considering all these, I need to create an itinerary that starts at Presidio at 9:00 AM and fits all these meetings within the constraints. The user needs to move between locations efficiently, so the travel times between each meeting location should be reasonable.\n\nFirst, perhaps meet Melissa at The Castro right after arriving, as she's available early. Then, from The Castro, maybe go to Presidio again, but wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, after meeting Melissa, go to another nearby location.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to start with the earliest available meetings. So, Melissa at The Castro from 9:30 AM. Then, from there, go to Presidio, but that would mean traveling back, which might not be efficient. Alternatively, after meeting Melissa, go to another location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with meeting someone closer to Presidio. Joseph at Golden Gate Park is only 12 minutes away. He's available from 8:30 AM, but the user arrives at 9:00 AM. So, maybe meet Joseph first, then proceed.\n\nBut the user arrives at Presidio at 9:00 AM, so the first meeting could be at Golden Gate Park, which is 12 minutes away. Then, after that, go to The Castro for Melissa's meeting.\n\nWait, but the user needs to meet as many friends as possible, so perhaps prioritize the ones with the earliest availability or those requiring the most time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps start with the friend that allows the most flexibility. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user should meet the friend who is available earliest and requires the least time first, then move on to others.\n\nBut in this case, the user has several friends spread out across the day, so it's a bit complex.\n\nAnother approach is to look for overlapping time windows where the user can attend multiple meetings without too much travel time in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can start with a morning meeting, then have lunch, then afternoon meetings.\n\nBut given the time constraints, it's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Melissa first at The Castro at 9:30 AM, then go to Presidio, but that seems redundant. Alternatively, after meeting Melissa, go to another location.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Jeffrey at Fisherman's Wharf in the afternoon, as he's available from 12:45 PM. That would give the user time to handle other meetings in the morning.\n\nSimilarly, Amanda is available from 2:45 PM, so the user can meet her after Jeffrey.\n\nRobert is available from 11:15 AM, so perhaps meet him after the morning meetings.\n\nNancy is available from 5:00 PM, so the user can meet her in the evening.\n\nKaren is available from 5:30 PM, so after Nancy.\n\nMatthew is available from 10:15 AM, so maybe meet him in the morning.\n\nJoseph is available from 8:30 AM, so meet him early.\n\nBut the user arrives at 9:00 AM, so perhaps meet Joseph first at Golden Gate Park, then go to Presidio, then to The Castro for Melissa.\n\nWait, but Presidio is the starting point, so after meeting Joseph, the user can go to Presidio, then to The Castro.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet multiple friends in the morning, then have lunch, then more meetings in the afternoon.\n\nBut the user needs to meet as many friends as possible, so perhaps it's better to schedule the most time-intensive meetings first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet the friends who require the most time first, then the ones with less time.\n\nBut in this case, all meetings require at least 15 minutes, except for some that require up to 120 minutes.\n\nWait, the user's goal is to meet as many friends as possible, so perhaps it's better to maximize the number of meetings rather than the duration.\n\nBut given the time constraints, the user might need to prioritize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet friends in different parts of the city in a way that minimizes travel time.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to create a possible itinerary step by step.\n\nFirst, the user arrives at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n\nOption 1: Meet Joseph at Golden Gate Park. It's 12 minutes away, and he's available from 8:30 AM. So, the user can go to Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM, meet Joseph for 105 minutes until 10:15 AM. Then, from there, go to Presidio, but that's backtracking. Alternatively, from Golden Gate Park, go to another location.\n\nWait, but the user is starting at Presidio, so going to Golden Gate Park first makes sense.\n\nAfter meeting Joseph, the user can go to The Castro for Melissa's meeting. The Castro is 21 minutes from Presidio, but after leaving Golden Gate Park, the user would need to go back to Presidio, then to The Castro. That might be too much travel time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meet Melissa first at The Castro, then go to Golden Gate Park for Joseph.\n\nBut Melissa is available from 9:30 AM, so the user can go to The Castro at 9:30 AM, meet her for 30 minutes until 10:00 AM. Then, go to Golden Gate Park to meet Joseph from 10:15 AM to 11:15 AM. Then, proceed to other meetings.\n\nBut the user needs to consider the travel times between these locations.\n\nFrom Presidio to The Castro is 21 minutes, so leaving Presidio at 9:00 AM, arrive at The Castro at 9:21 AM. Meet Melissa until 9:30 AM, then leave for Golden Gate Park, which is 12 minutes from The Castro. So, arrive at 9:42 AM, meet Joseph until 10:42 AM. Then, from there, go to Presidio, which is 12 minutes away, arriving at 10:54 AM. Then, proceed to other meetings.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Joseph, go to another location.\n\nBut this seems a bit tight, but maybe manageable.\n\nThen, after that, the user can go to Presidio, then to Marina District to meet Amanda from 2:45 PM to 7:30 PM. But that's a long time, so the user needs to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet other friends in the morning and early afternoon, then meet Amanda in the evening.\n\nSimilarly, the user needs to meet Robert at Alamo Square from 11:15 AM to 5:30 PM. Alamo Square is 19 minutes from Presidio. So, perhaps meet Robert after Melissa and Joseph.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Maybe the user should prioritize the friends with the latest availability or the ones requiring the most time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet the friends in a way that maximizes the use of time and minimizes travel.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Jeffrey at Fisherman's Wharf in the afternoon, as he's available until 6:45 PM. That would allow the user to have a longer meeting.\n\nSimilarly, Amanda is available until 7:30 PM, so the user can meet her after Jeffrey.\n\nBut the user needs to meet as many friends as possible, so perhaps it's better to meet the friends who are available earlier or require less time first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet the friends who are closer to Presidio first, then move to farther locations.\n\nBut I think I need to try to create a specific itinerary, considering all these factors.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible plan:\n\n1. Start at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n\n2. Go to The Castro (21 minutes) to meet Melissa from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM.\n\n3. Then, go to Golden Gate Park (12 minutes from The Castro) to meet Joseph from 10:15 AM to 11:15 AM.\n\n4. After that, go back to Presidio (12 minutes) and then to Alamo Square (19 minutes) to meet Robert from 11:45 AM to 12:45 PM.\n\n5. Then, go to Marina District (10 minutes from Presidio) to meet Amanda from 2:45 PM to 7:30 PM.\n\n6. After that, go to Fisherman's Wharf (19 minutes from Presidio) to meet Jeffrey from 7:30 PM to 8:30 PM.\n\n7. Finally, go to Pacific Heights (11 minutes from Presidio) to meet Nancy from 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM.\n\nBut wait, this leaves out some friends like Matthew and Karen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Matthew at Bayview in the morning.\n\nFrom Presidio to Bayview is 31 minutes. If the user meets Matthew from 10:15 AM to 10:45 AM, then proceed to other meetings.\n\nBut this would require leaving Presidio at 9:00 AM, going to Bayview at 9:31 AM, meeting Matthew until 10:15 AM, then going back to Presidio, then to other locations.\n\nBut that might be too much travel.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Matthew after meeting others.\n\nBut the user needs to meet as many friends as possible, so perhaps it's better to include as many as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Matthew at Bayview on the way to another meeting.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nI think the key is to find an itinerary that allows the user to meet as many friends as possible without exceeding the time constraints and minimizing travel time.\n\nPerhaps the user can meet the friends in the order of their availability, starting with the earliest, then moving to later times.\n\nBut I'm not sure. I think I need to try to create a specific plan, considering all the constraints and maximizing the number of meetings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet the friends who are closer to Presidio first, then move outward.\n\nBut I think I need to make a decision on a specific itinerary, considering all the factors.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"The Castro\", \"person\": \"Melissa\", \"start_time\": \"09:30\", \"end_time\": \"10:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"10:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"12:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"Amanda\", \"start_time\": \"14:45\", \"end_time\": \"19:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"19:30\", \"end_time\": \"20:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\", \"person\": \"Nancy\", \"start_time\": \"20:30\", \"end_time\": \"21:30\"}\n  ]\n}",

That would give the user time to handle other meetings in the morning.\n\nSimilarly, Amanda is available from 2:45 PM, so the user can meet her after Jeffrey.\n\nRobert is available from 11:15 AM, so perhaps meet him after the morning meetings.\n\nNancy is available from 5:00 PM, so the user can meet her in the evening.\n\nKaren is available from 5:30 PM, so after Nancy.\n\nMatthew is available from 10:15 AM, so maybe meet him in the morning.\n\nJoseph is available from 8:30 AM, so meet him early.\n\nBut the user arrives at 9:00 AM, so perhaps meet Joseph first at Golden Gate Park, then go to Presidio, then to The Castro for Melissa.\n\nWait, but Presidio is the starting point, so after meeting Joseph, the user can go to Presidio, then to The Castro.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet multiple friends in the morning, then have lunch, then more meetings in the afternoon.\n\nBut the user needs to meet as many friends as possible, so perhaps it's better to schedule the most time-intensive meetings first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet the friends who require the most time first, then the ones with less time.\n\nBut in this case, all meetings require at least 15 minutes, except for some that require up to 120 minutes.\n\nWait, the user's goal is to meet as many friends as possible, so perhaps it's better to maximize the number of meetings rather than the duration.\n\nBut given the time constraints, the user might need to prioritize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet friends in different parts of the city in a way that minimizes travel time.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to create a possible itinerary step by step.\n\nFirst, the user arrives at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n\nOption 1: Meet Joseph at Golden Gate Park. It's 12 minutes away, and he's available from 8:30 AM. So, the user can go to Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM, meet Joseph for 105 minutes until 10:15 AM. Then, from there, go to Presidio, but that's backtracking. Alternatively, from Golden Gate Park, go to another location.\n\nWait, but the user is starting at Presidio, so going to Golden Gate Park first makes sense.\n\nAfter meeting Joseph, the user can go to The Castro for Melissa's meeting. The Castro is 21 minutes from Presidio, but after leaving Golden Gate Park, the user would need to go back to Presidio, then to The Castro. That might be too much travel time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meet Melissa first at The Castro, then go to Golden Gate Park for Joseph.\n\nBut Melissa is available from 9:30 AM, so the user can go to The Castro at 9:30 AM, meet her for 30 minutes until 10:00 AM. Then, go to Golden Gate Park to meet Joseph from 10:15 AM to 11:15 AM. Then, proceed to other meetings.\n\nBut the user needs to consider the travel times between these locations.\n\nFrom Presidio to The Castro is 21 minutes, so leaving Presidio at 9:00 AM, arrive at The Castro at 9:21 AM. Meet Melissa until 9:30 AM, then leave for Golden Gate Park, which is 12 minutes from The Castro. So, arrive at 9:42 AM, meet Joseph until 10:42 AM. Then, from there, go to Presidio, which is 12 minutes away, arriving at 10:54 AM. Then, proceed to other meetings.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Joseph, go to another location.\n\nBut this seems a bit tight, but maybe manageable.\n\nThen, after that, the user can go to Presidio, then to Marina District to meet Amanda from 2:45 PM to 7:30 PM. But that's a long time, so the user needs to plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet other friends in the morning and early afternoon, then meet Amanda in the evening.\n\nSimilarly, the user needs to meet Robert at Alamo Square from 11:15 AM to 5:30 PM. Alamo Square is 19 minutes from Presidio. So, perhaps meet Robert after Melissa and Joseph.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Maybe the user should prioritize the friends with the latest availability or the ones requiring the most time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet the friends in a way that maximizes the use of time and minimizes travel.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can meet Jeffrey at Fisherman's Wharf in the afternoon, as he's available until 6:45 PM. That would allow the user to have a longer meeting.\n\nSimilarly, Amanda is available until 7:30 PM, so the user can meet her after Jeffrey.\n\nBut the user needs to meet as many friends as possible, so perhaps it's better to meet the friends who are available earlier or require less time first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet the friends who are closer to Presidio first, then move to farther locations.\n\nBut I think I need to try to create a specific itinerary, considering all these factors.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible plan:\n\n1. Start at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n\n2. Go to The Castro (21 minutes) to meet Melissa from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM.\n\n3. Then, go to Golden Gate Park (12 minutes from The Castro) to meet Joseph from 10:15 AM to 11:15 AM.\n\n4. After that, go back to Presidio (12 minutes) and then to Alamo Square (19 minutes) to meet Robert from 11:45 AM to 12:45 PM.\n\n5. Then, go to Marina District (10 minutes from Presidio) to meet Amanda from 2:45 PM to 7:30 PM.\n\n6. After that, go to Fisherman's Wharf (19 minutes from Presidio) to meet Jeffrey from 7:30 PM to 8:30 PM.\n\n7. Finally, go to Pacific Heights (11 minutes from Presidio) to meet Nancy from 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM.\n\nBut wait, this leaves out some friends like Matthew and Karen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Matthew at Bayview in the morning.\n\nFrom Presidio to Bayview is 31 minutes. If the user meets Matthew from 10:15 AM to 10:45 AM, then proceed to other meetings.\n\nBut this would require leaving Presidio at 9:00 AM, going to Bayview at 9:31 AM, meeting Matthew until 10:15 AM, then going back to Presidio, then to other locations.\n\nBut that might be too much travel.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Matthew after meeting others.\n\nBut the user needs to meet as many friends as possible, so perhaps it's better to include as many as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Matthew at Bayview on the way to another meeting.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nI think the key is to find an itinerary that allows the user to meet as many friends as possible without exceeding the time constraints and minimizing travel time.\n\nPerhaps the user can meet the friends in the order of their availability, starting with the earliest, then moving to later times.\n\nBut I'm not sure. I think I need to try to create a specific plan, considering all the constraints and maximizing the number of meetings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet the friends who are closer to Presidio first, then move outward.\n\nBut I think I need to make a decision on a specific itinerary, considering all the factors.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:"
