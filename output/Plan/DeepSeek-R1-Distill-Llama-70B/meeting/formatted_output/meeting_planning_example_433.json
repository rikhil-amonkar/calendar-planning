            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help plan a meeting schedule for someone visiting San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and constraints. I've been given specific travel distances between different locations, which should help in figuring out the best times and places to meet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The person arrives at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. They have several friends spread out across the city, each available at different times and locations. Each meeting requires a minimum time, so I need to make sure there's enough overlap to accommodate that.\n\nLooking at the friends:\n\n1. **Emily** is at Richmond District from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. They need 15 minutes.\n2. **Margaret** is in the Financial District from 4:30 PM to 8:15 PM, needing 75 minutes.\n3. **Ronald** is at North Beach from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM, needing 45 minutes.\n4. **Deborah** is at The Castro from 1:45 PM to 9:15 PM, needing 90 minutes.\n5. **Jeffrey** is at Golden Gate Park from 11:15 AM to 2:30 PM, needing 120 minutes.\n\nI need to figure out a way to fit these meetings without overlapping too much, considering travel times between locations.\n\nStarting with the earliest possible meetings, **Jeffrey** is available from 11:15 AM, which is just after the arrival time. Golden Gate Park is a good starting point because it's central and has good connections.\n\nAfter meeting Jeffrey, the next earliest time would be around 12:00 PM. Next, I can consider meeting someone nearby or someone whose time slot aligns well.\n\nLooking at **Deborah** at The Castro from 1:45 PM, that's a few hours away. Maybe after Jeffrey, the next meeting could be with someone else.\n\n**Emily** is available in the evening, but maybe I can save her for later. **Ronald** is at North Beach from 6:30 PM, which is a bit later. **Margaret** is in the Financial District from 4:30 PM, which is earlier than Ronald.\n\nSo, perhaps after meeting Jeffrey, I can go to Financial District to meet Margaret. Then, after that, head to North Beach for Ronald. Then, in the evening, go to The Castro for Deborah, and finally Richmond District for Emily.\n\nI need to check the travel times between these locations to make sure the person doesn't spend too much time traveling, as that could cut into meeting times.\n\nStarting at Nob Hill, heading to Golden Gate Park: 17 minutes.\n\nAfter meeting Jeffrey until 2:30 PM, then go to Financial District: 20 minutes from Golden Gate Park to Financial District.\n\nThen, from Financial District to North Beach: 7 minutes.\n\nFrom North Beach to The Castro: 22 minutes.\n\nFrom The Castro to Richmond District: 16 minutes.\n\nWait, but Deborah is available until 9:15 PM, and Emily until 9:00 PM. So, if I meet Deborah at The Castro after Ronald, I can then go to Richmond District to meet Emily.\n\nBut I need to make sure the travel times don't make the person too late for the next meeting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet Deborah earlier, but her slot starts at 1:45 PM. So, perhaps after meeting Margaret and Jeffrey, I can go to The Castro.\n\nI also need to consider the minimum meeting times. Deborah needs 90 minutes, so I need to ensure that the meeting doesn't end too late, causing issues with the next meeting.\n\nIt's a bit tricky, but I think the best approach is to start with Jeffrey in the morning, then move to Financial District for Margaret, then North Beach for Ronald, then The Castro for Deborah, and finally Richmond District for Emily.\n\nI need to make sure the travel times between these locations are feasible and that the person doesn't have back-to-back meetings that are too close, allowing for some flexibility.\n\nLet me outline the itinerary:\n\n1. **Golden Gate Park (Jeffrey)**: 11:15 AM - 2:30 PM\n2. **Financial District (Margaret)**: 3:30 PM - 8:15 PM\n3. **North Beach (Ronald)**: 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM\n4. **The Castro (Deborah)**: 8:15 PM - 9:15 PM\n5. **Richmond District (Emily)**: 9:00 PM - 9:15 PM\n\nWait, but after meeting Deborah at 8:15 PM, going to Richmond District for Emily at 9:00 PM might be too late, considering travel time from The Castro to Richmond District is 16 minutes. That should be manageable.\n\nBut I need to check if the meeting times overlap correctly. Deborah's meeting ends at 9:15 PM, and Emily's starts at 9:00 PM, so there's a 15-minute overlap, which is acceptable since the minimum is 15 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, Margaret's meeting ends at 8:15 PM, and Ronald's starts at 6:30 PM, so there's a 1.5-hour overlap, which is more than enough.\n\nJeffrey's meeting is in the morning, so no conflicts there.\n\nI think this schedule works, but I should double-check the travel times to ensure the person isn't rushing between meetings.\n\nFrom Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park: 17 minutes.\n\nGolden Gate Park to Financial District: 20 minutes.\n\nFinancial District to North Beach: 7 minutes.\n\nNorth Beach to The Castro: 22 minutes.\n\nThe Castro to Richmond District: 16 minutes.\n\nTotal travel time between meetings is 17 + 20 + 7 + 22 + 16 = 82 minutes.\n\nSubtracting the meeting times:\n\nJeffrey: 2 hours 30 minutes\nMargaret: 4 hours 15 minutes\nRonald: 45 minutes\nDeborah: 1 hour 45 minutes\nEmily: 15 minutes\n\nTotal meeting time: 2:30 + 4:15 + 0:45 + 1:45 + 0:15 = 9:30 hours\n\nTravel time: 82 minutes \u2248 1 hour 22 minutes\n\nTotal time from 9:00 AM to 9:30 PM is 12 hours, which is sufficient.\n\nI think this schedule is feasible and meets all the constraints.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"14:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"person\": \"Margaret\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"20:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Ronald\", \"start_time\": \"19:30\", \"end_time\": \"20:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"The Castro\", \"person\": \"Deborah\", \"start_time\": \"20:15\", \"end_time\": \"21:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Richmond District\", \"person\": \"Emily\", \"start_time\": \"21:00\", \"end_time\": \"21:15\"}\n  ]\n}",
