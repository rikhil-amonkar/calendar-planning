            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this user schedule their meetings in San Francisco. They've given me a lot of travel distances between different locations and a set of constraints with specific people and their availability. My goal is to maximize the number of meetings they can attend while respecting the travel times and constraints.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the constraints. The user arrives at Presidio at 9:00 AM. That's my starting point. Now, I need to see who is available when and where.\n\nLooking at the people:\n\n- Jason is at Richmond District from 1:00 PM to 8:45 PM. He needs at least 90 minutes.\n- Melissa is at North Beach from 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM. She needs 45 minutes.\n- Brian is at Financial District from 9:45 AM to 9:45 PM. He needs 15 minutes.\n- Elizabeth is at Golden Gate Park from 8:45 AM to 9:30 PM. She needs 105 minutes.\n- Laura is at Union Square from 2:15 PM to 7:30 PM. She needs 75 minutes.\n\nI need to make sure that each meeting starts and ends within their availability and that the travel times between locations are accounted for.\n\nI'll start by considering the earliest possible meetings. Brian is available from 9:45 AM at Financial District. Since the user arrives at Presidio at 9:00 AM, I need to calculate the travel time from Presidio to Financial District, which is 23 minutes. So, the earliest the user can meet Brian is at 9:23 AM. But Brian isn't available until 9:45 AM, so the meeting can start at 9:45 AM.\n\nNext, Elizabeth is available from 8:45 AM at Golden Gate Park. The travel time from Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 12 minutes, so the user can meet her at 9:12 AM. That leaves enough time to then go to Financial District for Brian, but the travel time from Golden Gate Park to Financial District is 23 minutes, which would make it 9:12 + 23 = 9:35 AM. Brian is available from 9:45, so that's too early. Maybe it's better to meet Elizabeth later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Elizabeth after meeting Brian. Let's see. If the user meets Brian at 9:45 AM at Financial District, then goes to Golden Gate Park, the travel time is 23 minutes, so they can arrive at 10:08 AM. Elizabeth is available until 9:30 PM, so there's plenty of time. The meeting with Elizabeth needs 105 minutes, so they can start at 10:08 AM and end at 11:13 AM.\n\nThen, from Golden Gate Park, the next earliest location would be North Beach for Melissa. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to North Beach is 24 minutes, so arriving at 11:13 + 24 = 11:37 AM. Melissa is available from 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM. That's too early. So maybe after that, the user can go to Union Square for Laura.\n\nFrom Golden Gate Park to Union Square is 22 minutes, so arriving at 11:13 + 22 = 11:35 AM. Laura is available from 2:15 PM to 7:30 PM. So the user can meet her later.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth, the user can go to Richmond District for Jason. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Richmond District is 7 minutes, arriving at 11:13 + 7 = 11:20 AM. Jason is available from 1:00 PM to 8:45 PM. So the user can meet him at 1:00 PM.\n\nSo the tentative schedule would be:\n\n1. Presidio to Financial District: meet Brian at 9:45 AM.\n2. Financial District to Golden Gate Park: meet Elizabeth at 10:08 AM.\n3. Golden Gate Park to Richmond District: meet Jason at 1:00 PM.\n4. Richmond District to North Beach: meet Melissa at 6:45 PM.\n5. North Beach to Union Square: meet Laura at 7:30 PM.\n\nWait, but the user needs to meet as many as possible, so maybe there's a better way. Let me check the travel times again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Elizabeth first, then Brian, then others.\n\nFrom Presidio to Golden Gate Park: 12 minutes, meeting Elizabeth at 9:12 AM.\n\nThen from Golden Gate Park to Financial District: 23 minutes, arriving at 9:35 AM. Brian is available from 9:45, so that's okay. Meet Brian at 9:45 AM.\n\nThen from Financial District to Richmond District: 21 minutes, arriving at 10:06 AM. Jason is available from 1:00 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth and Brian, go to Union Square for Laura. From Financial District to Union Square: 9 minutes, arriving at 9:45 + 9 = 9:54 AM. Laura is available from 2:15 PM, so too early.\n\nThen, maybe go to North Beach for Melissa. From Financial District to North Beach: 7 minutes, arriving at 9:45 + 7 = 9:52 AM. Melissa is available from 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nSo perhaps the best is to meet Elizabeth at 9:12 AM, then Brian at 9:45 AM, then go to Richmond District for Jason at 10:06 AM, but Jason isn't available until 1:00 PM. So that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Jason later. From Financial District to Richmond District: 21 minutes, so if the user leaves Financial District at 10:06 AM, they can arrive at 10:27 AM. But Jason starts at 1:00 PM, so still too early.\n\nWait, maybe the user can go from Financial District to Richmond District, then to North Beach, then to Union Square, etc., but that might take too much time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Jason at 1:00 PM. From Presidio to Richmond District is 7 minutes, so the user can leave Presidio at 9:07 AM, arrive at 9:14 AM. But Jason isn't available until 1:00 PM, so the user has to wait until 1:00 PM to meet him.\n\nSo the user can:\n\n1. Presidio to Richmond District: arrive at 9:14 AM. Jason isn't available until 1:00 PM, so wait until 1:00 PM to meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 2:30 PM.\n\n2. From Richmond District to Financial District: 22 minutes, arriving at 2:30 + 22 = 2:52 PM.\n\n3. Meet Brian at Financial District at 3:15 PM (since he's available from 9:45 AM to 9:45 PM).\n\n4. From Financial District to Golden Gate Park: 23 minutes, arriving at 3:15 + 23 = 3:38 PM.\n\n5. Meet Elizabeth at Golden Gate Park for 105 minutes, starting at 3:38 PM, ending at 4:43 PM.\n\n6. From Golden Gate Park to North Beach: 24 minutes, arriving at 4:43 + 24 = 5:07 PM.\n\n7. Meet Melissa at North Beach from 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM. So the user can meet her at 6:45 PM.\n\n8. From North Beach to Union Square: 7 minutes, arriving at 6:45 + 7 = 6:52 PM.\n\n9. Meet Laura at Union Square from 2:15 PM to 7:30 PM. So the user can meet her at 7:30 PM.\n\nThis way, the user meets Jason, Brian, Elizabeth, Melissa, and Laura. That's five meetings, which seems good. But I need to make sure the travel times are correct and that the meetings don't overlap.\n\nWait, from Richmond District to Financial District is 22 minutes, so from 2:30 PM to 2:52 PM. Then meet Brian at 3:15 PM. That's okay.\n\nFrom Financial District to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes, so 3:15 + 23 = 3:38 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 3:38 to 4:43 PM.\n\nThen to North Beach: 24 minutes, 4:43 + 24 = 5:07 PM. Melissa is available from 6:45 PM, so the user can wait until 6:45 PM to meet her.\n\nFrom North Beach to Union Square: 7 minutes, arriving at 6:45 + 7 = 6:52 PM. Laura is available until 7:30 PM, so meet her at 7:30 PM.\n\nThis seems feasible. So the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Jason at Richmond District at 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\n2. Travel to Financial District, meet Brian at 3:15 PM.\n\n3. Travel to Golden Gate Park, meet Elizabeth at 3:38 PM to 4:43 PM.\n\n4. Travel to North Beach, meet Melissa at 6:45 PM.\n\n5. Travel to Union Square, meet Laura at 7:30 PM.\n\nThat's five meetings. Is there a way to fit in more? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth, could the user go to Union Square to meet Laura earlier? From Golden Gate Park to Union Square is 22 minutes, arriving at 3:38 + 22 = 3:60, which is 4:00 PM. Laura is available from 2:15 PM, so that's possible. Meet Laura at 4:00 PM, ending at 5:15 PM.\n\nThen from Union Square to North Beach: 7 minutes, arriving at 5:15 + 7 = 5:22 PM. Melissa is available from 6:45 PM, so wait until 6:45 PM.\n\nFrom North Beach to Richmond District: 18 minutes, arriving at 6:45 + 18 = 7:03 PM. Jason is available until 8:45 PM, but he needs 90 minutes. So the user could meet him at 7:03 PM, ending at 8:13 PM.\n\nThen from Richmond District to Financial District: 22 minutes, arriving at 8:13 + 22 = 8:35 PM. Brian is available until 9:45 PM, so meet him at 8:35 PM, ending at 8:50 PM.\n\nThis way, the user meets:\n\n1. Jason at 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\n2. Laura at 4:00 PM to 5:15 PM.\n\n3. Elizabeth at 3:38 PM to 4:43 PM.\n\n4. Melissa at 6:45 PM.\n\n5. Brian at 8:35 PM to 8:50 PM.\n\nThat's five meetings as well. Maybe this is better because it allows the user to meet Laura earlier.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to meet more people? Let's see.\n\nIf the user meets Elizabeth at 3:38 PM to 4:43 PM, then goes to Union Square to meet Laura at 4:43 PM to 5:43 PM (if Laura is available), but Laura is available until 7:30 PM. So that's possible.\n\nThen from Union Square to North Beach: 7 minutes, arriving at 5:43 + 7 = 5:50 PM. Melissa is available from 6:45 PM, so wait until 6:45 PM.\n\nFrom North Beach to Richmond District: 18 minutes, arriving at 6:45 + 18 = 7:03 PM. Meet Jason at 7:03 PM to 8:13 PM.\n\nThen from Richmond District to Financial District: 22 minutes, arriving at 8:13 + 22 = 8:35 PM. Meet Brian at 8:35 PM to 8:50 PM.\n\nSo the user meets:\n\n1. Jason at 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\n2. Elizabeth at 3:38 PM to 4:43 PM.\n\n3. Laura at 4:43 PM to 5:43 PM.\n\n4. Melissa at 6:45 PM.\n\n5. Brian at 8:35 PM to 8:50 PM.\n\nThat's five meetings. It seems challenging to fit in six because of the travel times and the constraints on when each person is available.\n\nSo, the best plan is to meet Jason, Elizabeth, Laura, Melissa, and Brian, totaling five meetings. The user can't meet Kenneth because he's at Marina District from 10:45 AM to 1:00 PM, which is too early for the user to reach after meeting others.\n\nTherefore, the final itinerary would include these five meetings, ensuring that each starts and ends within the available times and that the travel times are accounted for.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Richmond District\", \"person\": \"Jason\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Elizabeth\", \"start_time\": \"15:38\", \"end_time\": \"16:43\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Union Square\", \"person\": \"Laura\", \"start_time\": \"16:43\", \"end_time\": \"17:43\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Melissa\", \"start_time\": \"18:45\", \"end_time\": \"19:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"20:35\", \"end_time\": \"20:50\"}\n  ]\n}",

Meet Elizabeth from 3:38 to 4:43 PM.\n\nThen to North Beach: 24 minutes, 4:43 + 24 = 5:07 PM. Melissa is available from 6:45 PM, so the user can wait until 6:45 PM to meet her.\n\nFrom North Beach to Union Square: 7 minutes, arriving at 6:45 + 7 = 6:52 PM. Laura is available until 7:30 PM, so meet her at 7:30 PM.\n\nThis seems feasible. So the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Jason at Richmond District at 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\n2. Travel to Financial District, meet Brian at 3:15 PM.\n\n3. Travel to Golden Gate Park, meet Elizabeth at 3:38 PM to 4:43 PM.\n\n4. Travel to North Beach, meet Melissa at 6:45 PM.\n\n5. Travel to Union Square, meet Laura at 7:30 PM.\n\nThat's five meetings. Is there a way to fit in more? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth, could the user go to Union Square to meet Laura earlier? From Golden Gate Park to Union Square is 22 minutes, arriving at 3:38 + 22 = 3:60, which is 4:00 PM. Laura is available from 2:15 PM, so that's possible. Meet Laura at 4:00 PM, ending at 5:15 PM.\n\nThen from Union Square to North Beach: 7 minutes, arriving at 5:15 + 7 = 5:22 PM. Melissa is available from 6:45 PM, so wait until 6:45 PM.\n\nFrom North Beach to Richmond District: 18 minutes, arriving at 6:45 + 18 = 7:03 PM. Jason is available until 8:45 PM, but he needs 90 minutes. So the user could meet him at 7:03 PM, ending at 8:13 PM.\n\nThen from Richmond District to Financial District: 22 minutes, arriving at 8:13 + 22 = 8:35 PM. Brian is available until 9:45 PM, so meet him at 8:35 PM, ending at 8:50 PM.\n\nThis way, the user meets:\n\n1. Jason at 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\n2. Laura at 4:00 PM to 5:15 PM.\n\n3. Elizabeth at 3:38 PM to 4:43 PM.\n\n4. Melissa at 6:45 PM.\n\n5. Brian at 8:35 PM to 8:50 PM.\n\nThat's five meetings as well. Maybe this is better because it allows the user to meet Laura earlier.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to meet more people? Let's see.\n\nIf the user meets Elizabeth at 3:38 PM to 4:43 PM, then goes to Union Square to meet Laura at 4:43 PM to 5:43 PM (if Laura is available), but Laura is available until 7:30 PM. So that's possible.\n\nThen from Union Square to North Beach: 7 minutes, arriving at 5:43 + 7 = 5:50 PM. Melissa is available from 6:45 PM, so wait until 6:45 PM.\n\nFrom North Beach to Richmond District: 18 minutes, arriving at 6:45 + 18 = 7:03 PM. Meet Jason at 7:03 PM to 8:13 PM.\n\nThen from Richmond District to Financial District: 22 minutes, arriving at 8:13 + 22 = 8:35 PM. Meet Brian at 8:35 PM to 8:50 PM.\n\nSo the user meets:\n\n1. Jason at 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\n2. Elizabeth at 3:38 PM to 4:43 PM.\n\n3. Laura at 4:43 PM to 5:43 PM.\n\n4. Melissa at 6:45 PM.\n\n5. Brian at 8:35 PM to 8:50 PM.\n\nThat's five meetings. It seems challenging to fit in six because of the travel times and the constraints on when each person is available.\n\nSo, the best plan is to meet Jason, Elizabeth, Laura, Melissa, and Brian, totaling five meetings. The user can't meet Kenneth because he's at Marina District from 10:45 AM to 1:00 PM, which is too early for the user to reach after meeting others.\n\nTherefore, the final itinerary would include these five meetings, ensuring that each starts and ends within the available times and that the travel times are accounted for.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:"
