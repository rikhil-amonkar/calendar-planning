            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The user wants to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, starting from Bayview at 9:00 AM. They've provided a detailed list of travel distances and constraints, so I need to carefully plan the itinerary to maximize the number of meetings while considering the time constraints and travel times.\n\nFirst, I'll review the constraints to understand the available time windows for each meeting. The user arrives at Bayview at 9:00 AM, so any meetings need to fit within their schedule, considering both their arrival time and the friends' availability.\n\nLooking at the constraints, I see that:\n\n- **Paul** is at Nob Hill from 4:15 PM to 9:15 PM. Meeting Paul requires at least 60 minutes.\n- **Carol** is at Union Square from 6:00 PM to 8:15 PM. Meeting Carol needs 120 minutes.\n- **Patricia** is at Chinatown from 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM. Meeting Patricia needs 75 minutes.\n- **Karen** is at The Castro from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Meeting Karen needs 45 minutes.\n- **Nancy** is at Presidio from 11:45 AM to 10:00 PM. Meeting Nancy needs 30 minutes.\n- **Jeffrey** is at Pacific Heights from 8:00 PM to 8:45 PM. Meeting Jeffrey needs 45 minutes.\n- **Matthew** is at Russian Hill from 3:45 PM to 9:45 PM. Meeting Matthew needs 75 minutes.\n\nGiven these constraints, the latest possible meeting time without overlapping is with **Patricia** at 9:30 PM, but considering the travel times, I need to ensure that each meeting can be attended without backtracking too much.\n\nStarting with **Paul** at Nob Hill, who's available from 4:15 PM to 9:15 PM. To reach Nob Hill from Bayview, it takes 20 minutes. If I leave Bayview at 3:45 PM, I can arrive at Nob Hill by 4:05 PM, which is within Paul's availability. However, considering the travel time, I should plan to leave a bit earlier to ensure I arrive on time.\n\nNext, **Carol** is at Union Square from 6:00 PM to 8:15 PM. To get there from Nob Hill, it's a 7-minute walk. If I leave Nob Hill at 5:45 PM, I can arrive at Union Square by 5:52 PM, but Carol is only available from 6:00 PM. So, I can meet her at 6:00 PM and spend 120 minutes, leaving at 7:12 PM.\n\nThen, **Patricia** is at Chinatown from 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM. From Union Square, Chinatown is 7 minutes away. If I leave Union Square at 7:12 PM, I can arrive at Chinatown by 7:19 PM, but Patricia is available starting at 8:00 PM. To meet her, I need to leave enough time for travel and the meeting. Meeting her at 8:00 PM would allow me to spend 75 minutes until 9:15 PM, leaving at 9:15 PM.\n\nFor **Karen**, she's at The Castro from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. From Bayview, The Castro is 20 minutes away. If I leave Bayview at 4:45 PM, I can arrive at The Castro by 5:05 PM, meeting Karen for 45 minutes until 5:50 PM, then head to Nob Hill.\n\n**Nancy** is at Presidio from 11:45 AM to 10:00 PM. From Bayview, Presidio is 31 minutes away. If I leave Bayview at 11:15 AM, I can arrive at Presidio by 11:46 AM, meeting Nancy for 30 minutes until 12:16 PM, then proceed to other meetings.\n\n**Jeffrey** is at Pacific Heights from 8:00 PM to 8:45 PM. From Bayview, Pacific Heights is 23 minutes away. If I leave Bayview at 7:45 PM, I can arrive at Pacific Heights by 8:10 PM, meeting Jeffrey for 45 minutes until 8:55 PM.\n\n**Matthew** is at Russian Hill from 3:45 PM to 9:45 PM. From Bayview, Russian Hill is 23 minutes away. If I leave Bayview at 3:15 PM, I can arrive at Russian Hill by 3:38 PM, meeting Matthew for 75 minutes until 4:53 PM, then move to Nob Hill.\n\nConsidering all these, the optimal schedule would be:\n\n1. **Matthew** at Russian Hill from 3:45 PM to 4:53 PM.\n2. **Paul** at Nob Hill from 4:05 PM to 5:05 PM.\n3. **Karen** at The Castro from 5:05 PM to 5:50 PM.\n4. **Nancy** at Presidio from 11:45 AM to 12:16 PM.\n5. **Jeffrey** at Pacific Heights from 8:10 PM to 8:55 PM.\n6. **Carol** at Union Square from 6:00 PM to 7:12 PM.\n7. **Patricia** at Chinatown from 8:00 PM to 9:15 PM.\n\nThis schedule ensures that I meet all friends without overlapping times and maximizes the number of meetings. I need to make sure each meeting's location is reachable from the previous one without excessive travel time, ensuring a smooth day of meetings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Matthew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:40\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Nob Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Paul\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"The Castro\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Presidio\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:10\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:55\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:12\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Patricia\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
