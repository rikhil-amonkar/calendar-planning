            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help plan this meeting schedule. The user is an AI meeting planner visiting San Francisco and wants to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and constraints. They've provided a set of travel distances between various locations and a list of constraints with people available at specific times and places.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. There are five people to meet: Thomas, Stephanie, Laura, Betty, and Patricia, each available at different times and locations.\n\nLet me list out each person's availability:\n\n1. **Thomas**: Bayview from 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM. Needs 120 minutes.\n2. **Stephanie**: Golden Gate Park from 6:30 PM to 9:45 PM. Needs 30 minutes.\n3. **Laura**: Nob Hill from 8:45 AM to 4:15 PM. Needs 30 minutes.\n4. **Betty**: Marina District from 6:45 PM to 9:45 PM. Needs 45 minutes.\n5. **Patricia**: Embarcadero from 5:30 PM to 10:00 PM. Needs 45 minutes.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the number of meetings while respecting the travel times and ensuring each meeting has the required duration.\n\nI should start by checking who can be met first. Laura is available from 8:45 AM, which is just after the user arrives. She needs only 30 minutes. Meeting Laura early seems logical because she's available first thing in the morning.\n\nNext, after meeting Laura, the user can move to the next location. Nob Hill to Marina District is 11 minutes, so it's a quick travel time. Betty is available starting at 6:45 PM, but that's a long time later. Maybe there's a better option.\n\nLooking at the others, Thomas is available from 3:30 PM, which is later in the afternoon. He needs 120 minutes, which is two hours. If the user meets Thomas, they need to plan for a two-hour block.\n\nStephanie is available from 6:30 PM, which is after Thomas's slot. She needs only 30 minutes. Betty is available from 6:45 PM, which overlaps with Stephanie's time. Patricia is available from 5:30 PM, which is earlier than Thomas's 3:30 PM, but Patricia's slot is from 5:30 PM to 10:00 PM.\n\nWait, Patricia is available from 5:30 PM, which is before Thomas's 3:30 PM. That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo, but assuming it's correct, Patricia is available later in the evening.\n\nSo, considering the timings, the user should prioritize meeting Laura first. Then, perhaps move to another location where someone is available later.\n\nIf the user meets Laura at 9:00 AM, then needs to travel to the next location. Nob Hill is 9 minutes from Fisherman's Wharf. Then, from Nob Hill, the user can go to Marina District, which is 11 minutes away, but Betty is only available from 6:45 PM. That's too far.\n\nAlternatively, from Fisherman's Wharf, the user can go to Bayview, which is 26 minutes away, but Thomas is only available from 3:30 PM.\n\nWait, maybe the user can meet Laura first, then move to Golden Gate Park to meet Stephanie, but that's a longer travel time from Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park, which is 17 minutes. But if the user goes from Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park, that's 17 minutes. However, Laura is only available until 4:15 PM, so the user can't spend too much time there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meeting Thomas first. He's available from 3:30 PM, which is a few hours after arrival. He needs 120 minutes, so the meeting would end at 5:30 PM. Then, the user can move to Golden Gate Park to meet Stephanie, who's available from 6:30 PM, but that's a 30-minute gap.\n\nWait, from Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26 minutes, then from Bayview to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes. So, if the user goes to Bayview at 9:00 AM, meets Thomas from 3:30 PM, that's a 6-hour wait. That's too long. The user can't just wait around.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to meet Laura first to utilize the early morning slot. Then, after meeting Laura, the user can move to another location where someone is available later.\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf, to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. Then, from Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park is 17 minutes. But Laura is only available until 4:15 PM. So, the user can meet Laura at 9:00 AM, then go to Golden Gate Park, but that's too far for an early meeting.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Laura, the user can move to Bayview to meet Thomas. From Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 minutes. But Thomas is available from 3:30 PM, so the user can't meet him until then.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the optimal schedule is to meet Laura first, then move to Bayview to meet Thomas, and then proceed to Golden Gate Park to meet Stephanie.\n\nWait, but the user needs to consider the travel times between meetings. Each travel time adds to the schedule.\n\nLet me try mapping it out:\n\n1. **Fisherman's Wharf (9:00 AM)**\n   - **Option 1**: Meet Laura at Nob Hill. Travel time 11 minutes.\n     - Meeting: 9:00 AM\n     - End: 9:30 AM\n     - Then, from Nob Hill to Bayview: 19 minutes. Arrive at 9:49 AM.\n     - Thomas is available from 3:30 PM. Can't meet him until then.\n\n2. **Option 2**: Meet Thomas at Bayview. Travel time 26 minutes.\n     - Meeting: 9:00 AM\n     - End: 5:30 PM (since he needs 120 minutes)\n     - Then, from Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 minutes. Arrive at 5:52 PM.\n     - Stephanie is available from 6:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis seems better. Meeting Thomas first, then Stephanie.\n\nBut wait, the user can't meet Thomas at 9:00 AM because he's available from 3:30 PM. So, the user needs to wait until 3:30 PM to meet Thomas. That's a 6-hour wait, which isn't ideal but necessary.\n\nAfter meeting Thomas, the user can go to Golden Gate Park to meet Stephanie. From Bayview to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes, arriving at 5:52 PM. Stephanie is available from 6:30 PM, so the user can wait until then.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Thomas, the user can go to Marina District to meet Betty. From Bayview to Marina District is 25 minutes, arriving at 5:25 PM. Betty is available from 6:45 PM, so again, the user has to wait.\n\nThis isn't efficient. Maybe the user should meet Laura first to use the early morning slot.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n1. **Fisherman's Wharf (9:00 AM)**\n   - **Option 1**: Meet Laura at Nob Hill. Travel time 11 minutes.\n     - Meeting: 9:00 AM\n     - End: 9:30 AM\n     - Then, from Nob Hill to Bayview: 19 minutes. Arrive at 9:49 AM.\n     - From Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 minutes. Arrive at 10:11 AM.\n     - Stephanie is available from 6:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\n2. **Option 2**: Meet Laura at 9:00 AM, then go to Bayview to meet Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n\n   - Meeting Laura: 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM\n   - Travel to Bayview: 9:30 AM - 9:49 AM\n   - Wait until 3:30 PM to meet Thomas: 9:49 AM - 3:30 PM (5 hours 41 minutes)\n   - Meeting Thomas: 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM\n   - Then, from Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 5:30 PM - 5:52 PM\n   - Wait until 6:30 PM to meet Stephanie: 5:52 PM - 6:30 PM (38 minutes)\n   - Meeting Stephanie: 6:30 PM - 6:58 PM\n   - Then, from Golden Gate Park to Marina District: 16 minutes. Arrive at 7:14 PM\n   - Betty is available from 6:45 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis seems too spread out. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Laura, the user can go to Marina District to meet Betty. From Nob Hill to Marina District is 11 minutes. Betty is available from 6:45 PM.\n\n- Meeting Laura: 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM\n- Travel to Marina District: 9:30 AM - 9:41 AM\n- Wait until 6:45 PM: 9:41 AM - 6:45 PM (9 hours 4 minutes)\n- Meeting Betty: 6:45 PM - 7:30 PM\n- Then, from Marina District to Golden Gate Park: 18 minutes. Arrive at 7:48 PM\n- Stephanie is available from 6:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis is also not efficient.\n\nPerhaps the user should focus on meeting the person who needs the most time first, which is Thomas (120 minutes), then the others with shorter durations.\n\nSo, the user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. They need to wait until 3:30 PM to meet Thomas in Bayview.\n\n- 9:00 AM - 3:30 PM: Waiting time\n- Meeting Thomas: 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM\n- Then, from Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 minutes. Arrive at 5:52 PM\n- Stephanie is available from 6:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n- Wait until 6:30 PM: 5:52 PM - 6:30 PM (38 minutes)\n- Meeting Stephanie: 6:30 PM - 6:58 PM\n- Then, from Golden Gate Park to Marina District: 16 minutes. Arrive at 7:14 PM\n- Betty is available from 6:45 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n- Wait until 6:45 PM: 7:14 PM - 6:45 PM (can't happen; 7:14 is after 6:45)\n- So, the user can meet Betty at 7:14 PM, but she's available until 9:45 PM.\n- Meeting Betty: 7:14 PM - 7:59 PM\n- Then, from Marina District to Embarcadero: 12 minutes. Arrive at 8:11 PM\n- Patricia is available from 5:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis doesn't work because the user can't go back in time.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Thomas and Stephanie, the user can go to Embarcadero to meet Patricia.\n\nFrom Golden Gate Park to Embarcadero is 25 minutes. Arrive at 7:17 PM. Patricia is available from 5:30 PM, so can meet her from 7:17 PM - 8:02 PM.\n\n- Meeting Patricia: 7:17 PM - 8:02 PM\n- Then, from Embarcadero to Marina District: 12 minutes. Arrive at 8:14 PM\n- Betty is available from 6:45 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis is still not working.\n\nMaybe the user should meet Laura first to utilize the early morning slot, then proceed to other meetings.\n\n- Meeting Laura: 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM\n- From Nob Hill to Bayview: 19 minutes. Arrive at 9:49 AM\n- From Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 minutes. Arrive at 10:11 AM\n- Stephanie is available from 6:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n- From Golden Gate Park to Marina District: 16 minutes. Arrive at 10:27 AM\n- Betty is available from 6:45 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n- From Marina District to Embarcadero: 12 minutes. Arrive at 10:39 AM\n- Patricia is available from 5:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis approach isn't efficient either.\n\nPerhaps the user can meet Laura, then go to Bayview to meet Thomas, then to Golden Gate Park to meet Stephanie, and finally to Marina District to meet Betty.\n\n- Meeting Laura: 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM\n- From Nob Hill to Bayview: 19 minutes. Arrive at 9:49 AM\n- Meeting Thomas: 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM\n- From Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 minutes. Arrive at 5:52 PM\n- Meeting Stephanie: 6:30 PM - 6:58 PM\n- From Golden Gate Park to Marina District: 16 minutes. Arrive at 7:14 PM\n- Meeting Betty: 7:14 PM - 7:59 PM\n- From Marina District to Embarcadero: 12 minutes. Arrive at 8:11 PM\n- Patricia is available from 5:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nStill, the user can't meet Patricia because she's only available until 10:00 PM, but the user would need to travel back, which isn't feasible.\n\nGiven the constraints, the best schedule seems to be:\n\n1. Meet Laura at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Bayview to meet Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n3. Then, go to Golden Gate Park to meet Stephanie at 6:30 PM.\n4. Finally, go to Marina District to meet Betty at 7:14 PM.\n\nThis way, the user meets three people, utilizing the available time slots effectively.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Nob Hill\", \"person\": \"Laura\", \"start_time\": \"9:00\", \"end_time\": \"9:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Bayview\", \"person\": \"Thomas\", \"start_time\": \"3:30\", \"end_time\": \"5:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Stephanie\", \"start_time\": \"6:30\", \"end_time\": \"6:58\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"Betty\", \"start_time\": \"7:14\", \"end_time\": \"7:59\"}\n  ]\n}",

Can't meet her until then.\n\n2. **Option 2**: Meet Laura at 9:00 AM, then go to Bayview to meet Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n\n   - Meeting Laura: 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM\n   - Travel to Bayview: 9:30 AM - 9:49 AM\n   - Wait until 3:30 PM to meet Thomas: 9:49 AM - 3:30 PM (5 hours 41 minutes)\n   - Meeting Thomas: 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM\n   - Then, from Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 5:30 PM - 5:52 PM\n   - Wait until 6:30 PM to meet Stephanie: 5:52 PM - 6:30 PM (38 minutes)\n   - Meeting Stephanie: 6:30 PM - 6:58 PM\n   - Then, from Golden Gate Park to Marina District: 16 minutes. Arrive at 7:14 PM\n   - Betty is available from 6:45 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis seems too spread out. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Laura, the user can go to Marina District to meet Betty. From Nob Hill to Marina District is 11 minutes. Betty is available from 6:45 PM.\n\n- Meeting Laura: 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM\n- Travel to Marina District: 9:30 AM - 9:41 AM\n- Wait until 6:45 PM: 9:41 AM - 6:45 PM (9 hours 4 minutes)\n- Meeting Betty: 6:45 PM - 7:30 PM\n- Then, from Marina District to Golden Gate Park: 18 minutes. Arrive at 7:48 PM\n- Stephanie is available from 6:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis is also not efficient.\n\nPerhaps the user should focus on meeting the person who needs the most time first, which is Thomas (120 minutes), then the others with shorter durations.\n\nSo, the user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. They need to wait until 3:30 PM to meet Thomas in Bayview.\n\n- 9:00 AM - 3:30 PM: Waiting time\n- Meeting Thomas: 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM\n- Then, from Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 minutes. Arrive at 5:52 PM\n- Stephanie is available from 6:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n- Wait until 6:30 PM: 5:52 PM - 6:30 PM (38 minutes)\n- Meeting Stephanie: 6:30 PM - 6:58 PM\n- Then, from Golden Gate Park to Marina District: 16 minutes. Arrive at 7:14 PM\n- Betty is available from 6:45 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n- Wait until 6:45 PM: 7:14 PM - 6:45 PM (can't happen; 7:14 is after 6:45)\n- So, the user can meet Betty at 7:14 PM, but she's available until 9:45 PM.\n- Meeting Betty: 7:14 PM - 7:59 PM\n- Then, from Marina District to Embarcadero: 12 minutes. Arrive at 8:11 PM\n- Patricia is available from 5:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis doesn't work because the user can't go back in time.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Thomas and Stephanie, the user can go to Embarcadero to meet Patricia.\n\nFrom Golden Gate Park to Embarcadero is 25 minutes. Arrive at 7:17 PM. Patricia is available from 5:30 PM, so can meet her from 7:17 PM - 8:02 PM.\n\n- Meeting Patricia: 7:17 PM - 8:02 PM\n- Then, from Embarcadero to Marina District: 12 minutes. Arrive at 8:14 PM\n- Betty is available from 6:45 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis is still not working.\n\nMaybe the user should meet Laura first to utilize the early morning slot, then proceed to other meetings.\n\n- Meeting Laura: 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM\n- From Nob Hill to Bayview: 19 minutes. Arrive at 9:49 AM\n- From Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 minutes. Arrive at 10:11 AM\n- Stephanie is available from 6:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n- From Golden Gate Park to Marina District: 16 minutes. Arrive at 10:27 AM\n- Betty is available from 6:45 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n- From Marina District to Embarcadero: 12 minutes. Arrive at 10:39 AM\n- Patricia is available from 5:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nThis approach isn't efficient either.\n\nPerhaps the user can meet Laura, then go to Bayview to meet Thomas, then to Golden Gate Park to meet Stephanie, and finally to Marina District to meet Betty.\n\n- Meeting Laura: 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM\n- From Nob Hill to Bayview: 19 minutes. Arrive at 9:49 AM\n- Meeting Thomas: 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM\n- From Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 minutes. Arrive at 5:52 PM\n- Meeting Stephanie: 6:30 PM - 6:58 PM\n- From Golden Gate Park to Marina District: 16 minutes. Arrive at 7:14 PM\n- Meeting Betty: 7:14 PM - 7:59 PM\n- From Marina District to Embarcadero: 12 minutes. Arrive at 8:11 PM\n- Patricia is available from 5:30 PM. Can't meet her until then.\n\nStill, the user can't meet Patricia because she's only available until 10:00 PM, but the user would need to travel back, which isn't feasible.\n\nGiven the constraints, the best schedule seems to be:\n\n1. Meet Laura at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Bayview to meet Thomas at 3:30 PM.\n3. Then, go to Golden Gate Park to meet Stephanie at 6:30 PM.\n4. Finally, go to Marina District to meet Betty at 7:14 PM.\n\nThis way, the user meets three people, utilizing the available time slots effectively.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:"
