            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help this user create a meeting schedule for their day in San Francisco. They've given me a lot of travel distances between different locations and some constraints about when each person is available. My goal is to maximize the number of meetings they can attend without exceeding their travel time limits and making sure they meet each friend for the required minimum time.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by understanding the constraints. The user arrives at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. That's my starting point. Now, looking at the constraints, each friend has specific times when they're available. For example, Mary is at Embarcadero from 8:00 PM to 9:15 PM, which is a bit late in the day, but it's a good time for a meeting.\n\nNext, Kenneth is at The Castro from 11:15 AM to 7:15 PM. That's a longer window, so it's a good opportunity to meet him. Joseph is at Haight-Ashbury from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM, which is even later. Sarah is at Union Square from 11:45 AM to 2:30 PM. Thomas is at North Beach from 7:15 PM to 7:45 PM, Daniel is at Pacific Heights from 1:45 PM to 8:30 PM, Richard is at Chinatown from 8:00 AM to 6:45 PM, Mark is at Golden Gate Park from 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM, and David is at Marina District from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Karen is at Russian Hill from 1:15 PM to 6:30 PM.\n\nI need to figure out the best order to meet these people, considering the travel times and the duration each meeting requires. The user wants to meet each person for at least a certain amount of time, so I have to make sure that the meetings don't overlap and that the travel time between meetings is manageable.\n\nStarting with Mary at Embarcadero, since she's available late in the day, I can plan a meeting towards the end of the day. But I need to check if there's someone else who can be met earlier. Joseph is at Haight-Ashbury in the evening, so maybe I can meet him after Mary.\n\nLooking at Kenneth at The Castro, his availability is from 11:15 AM, which is earlier. So maybe I can meet him around noon. Then, moving on to Sarah at Union Square, who's available until 2:30 PM. That gives me some time to meet her in the early afternoon.\n\nThomas is at North Beach in the evening, so perhaps after meeting Sarah, I can head to North Beach. Daniel is at Pacific Heights until 8:30 PM, which is a good time slot in the evening. Richard is at Chinatown from 8:00 AM, which is early, but maybe I can squeeze that in if I can manage the travel time.\n\nMark is at Golden Gate Park until 9:30 PM, so that's another evening meeting. David is at Marina District from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM, so that's a short window but doable. Karen is at Russian Hill until 6:30 PM, so that's another evening meeting.\n\nI need to make sure the travel times between these meetings are reasonable. For example, moving from Nob Hill to The Castro, then to Union Square, and so on, without spending too much time traveling, so that I can fit in as many meetings as possible.\n\nI should also consider the minimum meeting times. Mary needs 75 minutes, Kenneth 30 minutes, Joseph 120 minutes, Sarah 90 minutes, Thomas 15 minutes, Daniel 15 minutes, Richard 30 minutes, Mark 120 minutes, David 60 minutes, and Karen 120 minutes.\n\nI think starting with Mary at Embarcadero in the evening makes sense. Then, moving to The Castro to meet Kenneth. After that, going to Union Square for Sarah. Then, heading to North Beach for Thomas. Later, visiting Pacific Heights for Daniel, Chinatown for Richard, Golden Gate Park for Mark, Marina District for David, and finally, Russian Hill for Karen.\n\nI need to make sure each meeting starts and ends within the specified time windows and that the travel times between locations are accounted for. This might require some trial and error to see the best order that maximizes the number of meetings without exceeding the time constraints.\n\nOverall, it's a complex puzzle, but by carefully planning the order of meetings and considering the travel times, I should be able to help the user meet as many friends as possible within the day.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"The Castro\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Thomas\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"Daniel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"08:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"08:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Marina District\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
