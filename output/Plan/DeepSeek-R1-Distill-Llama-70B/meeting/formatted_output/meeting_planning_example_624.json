            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to schedule my day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible. I've got a list of places and the distances between them, but I'm not exactly sure where to start. Let me see... I arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM, so that's my starting point. I need to meet Carol at Haight-Ashbury, Laura at Fisherman's Wharf, Karen at The Castro, Elizabeth at Chinatown, Deborah at Alamo Square, Jason at North Beach, and Steven at Russian Hill. Each of them has specific time slots available, and I need to make sure I can meet each of them for the required durations without backtracking too much.\n\nFirst, I'll note down the constraints and the travel distances to see which meetings can be fit in without too much traveling. Starting at Golden Gate Park, I need to go to Haight-Ashbury next. The distance from Golden Gate Park to Haight-Ashbury is 7 minutes, which is manageable. Carol is available from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM, but I arrive at 9:00 AM, so I can't meet her right away. Maybe I can come back later in the day.\n\nNext, Laura is at Fisherman's Wharf from 11:45 AM to 9:30 PM. That's a long window, so maybe I can meet her in the afternoon after other meetings. Laura is at Fisherman's Wharf, which is 24 minutes away from Golden Gate Park. I can add that to my itinerary after Haight-Ashbury.\n\nKaren is at The Castro from 7:15 AM to 2:00 PM. She's closer, only 13 minutes from Golden Gate Park. I can meet her early in the morning before heading out. Karen is available until 2:00 PM, so I'll schedule her first.\n\nElizabeth is at Chinatown from 12:15 PM to 9:30 PM. That's a good time slot in the afternoon. Chinatown is 23 minutes from Golden Gate Park. I'll need to plan to be in the area around lunchtime.\n\nDeborah is at Alamo Square from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Alamo Square is 10 minutes away from Golden Gate Park. Deborah needs 105 minutes, which is a long meeting, so I'll have to make sure I have enough time.\n\nJason is at North Beach from 2:45 PM to 7:00 PM. North Beach is 24 minutes from Golden Gate Park. That's a bit far, but doable in the afternoon.\n\nSteven is at Russian Hill from 2:45 PM to 6:30 PM. Russian Hill is 19 minutes from Golden Gate Park. He needs 120 minutes, which is a long meeting, so I'll have to plan carefully.\n\nNow, considering the travel times and the available slots, I need to figure out the optimal order. Starting with Karen at The Castro at 9:00 AM makes sense because she's close and available early. Then, I can go to Golden Gate Park, then Haight-Ashbury to meet Carol later in the day.\n\nAfter that, I can head to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Laura in the afternoon. On my way back, I can stop at Chinatown to meet Elizabeth. Then, I'll go to Alamo Square to meet Deborah. In the late afternoon, I'll visit North Beach to meet Jason and then go to Russian Hill to meet Steven.\n\nI need to make sure I have enough time between meetings for travel. For example, after meeting Deborah at Alamo Square, I have a 45-minute window to get to North Beach for Jason. That should be enough time, considering the travel distance is 27 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, after meeting Jason, I have 75 minutes to get to Russian Hill for Steven, which is 19 minutes away. That should work.\n\nI also need to check if I have enough time to return to Golden Gate Park if needed, but since I'm ending the day at Steven's meeting, I don't need to return.\n\nOverall, this seems feasible. I'll start with Karen, then go to Haight-Ashbury, Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, Alamo Square, North Beach, and finally Russian Hill. This way, I'm maximizing the number of friends I can meet without too much backtracking.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"The Castro\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:13\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Deborah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Steven\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
