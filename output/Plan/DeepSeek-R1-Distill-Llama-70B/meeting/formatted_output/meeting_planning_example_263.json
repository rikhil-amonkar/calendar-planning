            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to schedule my day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible. I've got this list of places and the distances between them, but I'm not exactly sure where to start. Let me see... I arrive at Bayview at 9:00 AM. My first thought is to check who I can meet nearby.\n\nLooking at the constraints, Betty is at Embarcadero from 7:45 PM to 9:45 PM. I need to meet her for at least 15 minutes. That seems doable if I can get there before she leaves. Then there's Karen at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM. I want to meet her for 30 minutes, so I should probably go early.\n\nThen there's Anthony at Financial District from 9:15 AM to 9:30 PM. He's available almost the entire day, so I should prioritize meeting him since he's available the longest. But I also need to consider the travel time from Bayview to each location.\n\nLet me map out the distances. Bayview to Embarcadero is 19 minutes, to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes, and to Financial District is 19 minutes. I need to decide which of these is the best starting point.\n\nIf I go to Financial District first, it's only 19 minutes from Bayview. That's quick. Then I can go to Fisherman's Wharf, which is another 11 minutes from Financial District. After that, Embarcadero is 5 minutes from Fisherman's Wharf. That seems efficient.\n\nWait, but I need to check the meeting times. Betty is at Embarcadero until 9:45 PM, so if I go there first, I can meet her in the morning before she leaves. But if I go later, maybe I can have more time. Hmm, but she's available until 9:45 PM, so it's flexible.\n\nKaren is at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM. If I go there after meeting Betty, I can catch her in the morning. But she's available until 3 PM, so there's a window.\n\nAnthony is at Financial District from 9:15 AM to 9:30 PM. He's available almost the entire day, so I can meet him at any time.\n\nSo maybe the best plan is to start with Financial District, then go to Fisherman's Wharf, then to Embarcadero. That way, I can meet Anthony, Karen, and Betty in one go without too much backtracking.\n\nLet me check the travel times again. From Bayview to Financial District: 19 minutes. Then to Fisherman's Wharf: 11 minutes. Then to Embarcadero: 5 minutes. That's a total of 35 minutes, which is manageable.\n\nI also need to make sure I don't miss any of the meeting times. For example, Karen is at Fisherman's Wharf until 3 PM, so I should make sure I don't go too late. Similarly, Betty is at Embarcadero until 9:45 PM, so if I go in the morning, I can meet her before she leaves.\n\nWait, but if I go to Financial District first, I can meet Anthony there, then go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Karen, and then to Embarcadero to meet Betty. That seems logical.\n\nAlternatively, I could go to Embarcadero first to meet Betty, then to Fisherman's Wharf for Karen, and then to Financial District for Anthony. That might also work. The travel times are similar, so either way is fine.\n\nI think the key is to maximize the number of meetings by minimizing travel time between locations. So, clustering the meetings in one area might be more efficient.\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n1. Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.\n2. Go to Financial District (19 minutes) to meet Anthony.\n3. Then go to Fisherman's Wharf (11 minutes) to meet Karen.\n4. Finally, go to Embarcadero (5 minutes) to meet Betty.\n\nThis way, I'm meeting all three friends in one trip, without too much back and forth.\n\nI also need to make sure I have enough time between meetings. For example, after meeting Anthony, I have some time before Karen's meeting starts. I can use that time to maybe explore a bit or have a snack.\n\nSimilarly, after meeting Karen, I have time before Betty's meeting. I can use that time to maybe do some quick errands or relax.\n\nI think this plan works. It's efficient, considering the travel times and the meeting constraints. I can't think of a better way to meet all three friends without spending too much time traveling.\n\nSo, to summarize, my itinerary would be:\n\n- Meet Anthony at Financial District at 9:00 AM.\n- Meet Karen at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:30 AM.\n- Meet Betty at Embarcadero at 9:45 AM.\n\nWait, but the travel times need to be considered. From Bayview to Financial District is 19 minutes. If I leave Bayview at 9:00 AM, I can arrive at Financial District by 9:19 AM. Then, after meeting Anthony, I can leave at 9:30 AM to go to Fisherman's Wharf, arriving by 9:41 AM. Then, leave Fisherman's Wharf at 10:00 AM to go to Embarcadero, arriving by 10:05 AM. That gives me enough time to meet Betty before she leaves at 9:45 PM.\n\nHmm, but wait, if I leave Fisherman's Wharf at 10:00 AM, I'll arrive at Embarcadero at 10:05 AM, but Betty is there until 9:45 PM. That's a long time, but I just need 15 minutes with her. So I can meet her anytime before she leaves.\n\nAlternatively, if I leave Fisherman's Wharf a bit later, I can have more time in Embarcadero. But I think the initial plan is fine.\n\nSo, the final itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Anthony at Financial District at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet Karen at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:30 AM.\n3. Meet Betty at Embarcadero at 10:05 AM.\n\nThat way, I'm maximizing the number of meetings without too much travel. I think that's the best approach given the constraints and travel times.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Anthony\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:05\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:20\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
