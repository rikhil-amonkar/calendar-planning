            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help this user schedule their day in San Francisco by meeting as many friends as possible. They've provided a lot of travel distances and specific constraints, so I need to make sure I consider all of that.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the constraints. The user arrives at the Financial District at 9:00 AM. There are five people they want to meet, each with their own location and time constraints. I need to plan the meetings in a way that minimizes travel time and allows them to meet each person without overlapping too much.\n\nLet me list out the people and their availability:\n\n1. **Stephanie** - Golden Gate Park from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Needs at least 105 minutes.\n2. **Karen** - Chinatown from 1:45 PM to 4:30 PM. Needs 15 minutes.\n3. **Brian** - Union Square from 3:00 PM to 5:15 PM. Needs 30 minutes.\n4. **Rebecca** - Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00 AM to 11:15 AM. Needs 30 minutes.\n5. **Joseph** - Pacific Heights from 8:15 AM to 9:30 AM. Needs 60 minutes.\n6. **Steven** - North Beach from 2:30 PM to 8:45 PM. Needs 120 minutes.\n\nStarting with Joseph, who is at Pacific Heights from 8:15 to 9:30 AM. Since the user arrives at 9:00 AM, they can meet Joseph right away. The travel time from Financial District to Pacific Heights is 13 minutes, which is short. Meeting Joseph first makes sense because his time window is early in the morning.\n\nNext, Rebecca is at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00 AM to 11:15 AM. The user can meet her before heading to Pacific Heights. Fisherman's Wharf is 10 minutes away from Financial District, so it's a quick trip. Meeting Rebecca early allows the user to have the rest of the day free for other meetings.\n\nAfter meeting Rebecca, the user can go to Pacific Heights for Joseph. Then, head to Golden Gate Park to meet Stephanie. The travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park is 24 minutes, which is manageable. Stephanie needs 105 minutes, so the meeting should be as long as possible within her availability.\n\nOnce Stephanie's meeting is done, the user can go to Chinatown to meet Karen. Chinatown is 7 minutes away from Golden Gate Park. Karen only needs 15 minutes, so it's a quick stop.\n\nThen, the user can proceed to Union Square to meet Brian. Union Square is 9 minutes from Chinatown. Brian's meeting is 30 minutes, which fits well in the schedule.\n\nFinally, the user can go to North Beach to meet Steven. North Beach is 7 minutes from Union Square. Steven needs 120 minutes, so the user should plan to spend the remaining time there, possibly extending the meeting or using the time effectively.\n\nI need to make sure the travel times add up and that each meeting fits within the person's available time. It's also important to consider the order of meetings to minimize backtracking and maximize efficiency.\n\nSo, the plan would be:\n\n1. **Fisherman's Wharf** - Meet Rebecca (8:00-11:15 AM)\n2. **Pacific Heights** - Meet Joseph (9:00-9:30 AM)\n3. **Golden Gate Park** - Meet Stephanie (11:00 AM-3:00 PM)\n4. **Chinatown** - Meet Karen (1:45-4:30 PM)\n5. **Union Square** - Meet Brian (3:00-5:15 PM)\n6. **North Beach** - Meet Steven (2:30-8:45 PM)\n\nThis sequence ensures that the user meets all friends without too much backtracking and within their available time windows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Steven\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
