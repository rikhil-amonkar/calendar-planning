            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm an AI meeting planner, and my task is to schedule meetings efficiently for someone visiting San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible while considering travel times and constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. They have four friends to meet: Melissa at Golden Gate Park, Nancy at Presidio, Emily at Richmond District, and one more, but I think the user mentioned three specific ones.\n\nLooking at the travel distances provided, I can see the time it takes to travel between different locations. My job is to figure out the best times to meet each person without backtracking too much, considering the time each person is available.\n\nStarting with Melissa at Golden Gate Park. She's available from 8:30 AM to 8:00 PM. Since the user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM, the earliest they can meet Melissa is right away. So, maybe 9:00 AM at Fisherman's Wharf. But wait, the user might need to travel to Golden Gate Park. Let me check the distance: Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park is 25 minutes. So, if they leave at 9:00 AM, they can arrive by 9:25 AM. But Melissa is available from 8:30 AM, so it's fine to meet her at 9:00 AM at Golden Gate Park. That way, the user doesn't have to travel too far early in the day.\n\nNext, Nancy is at Presidio from 7:45 PM to 10:00 PM. The user needs to get to Presidio. The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Presidio is 17 minutes. So, if they leave Fisherman's Wharf at 7:00 PM, they can arrive by 7:17 PM, but Nancy starts at 7:45 PM. That's a 25-minute gap. Maybe the user can leave a bit later. If they leave at 7:30 PM, they arrive at 7:47 PM, which is within Nancy's available time. So, meeting Nancy at 7:30 PM at Presidio seems feasible.\n\nThen, Emily is at Richmond District from 4:45 PM to 10:00 PM. The user needs to travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District, which takes 18 minutes. If they leave Fisherman's Wharf at 4:45 PM, they can arrive at 5:03 PM, just in time to meet Emily. Alternatively, they could leave a bit later, but 4:45 PM seems optimal.\n\nNow, considering the travel times and the availability of each person, the user needs to plan the meetings in a way that minimizes travel time between locations. Starting with Melissa at Golden Gate Park in the morning makes sense because it's close to Fisherman's Wharf. Then, after that, moving to Presidio in the evening, and finally Richmond District later in the day.\n\nI need to make sure the user has enough time to travel between meetings. For example, after meeting Melissa at 9:00 AM, they can stay at Golden Gate Park until they need to head to Presidio at 7:30 PM. That gives them plenty of time to move around without rush.\n\nWait, but the user only has four friends to meet. Did I miss someone? Let me check the constraints again. Oh, the user mentioned three friends: Melissa, Nancy, and Emily. So, I think I've covered all three.\n\nLet me outline the itinerary:\n\n1. Meet Melissa at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Presidio, leaving around 7:30 PM to meet Nancy.\n3. After meeting Nancy, travel to Richmond District to meet Emily at 4:45 PM.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the user needs to be at Richmond District at 4:45 PM, but they have to travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District, which takes 18 minutes. So, they need to leave Fisherman's Wharf by 4:45 PM to arrive by 5:03 PM.\n\nBut if they're meeting Nancy at Presidio at 7:30 PM, that's after Emily's availability. So, perhaps they need to meet Emily earlier.\n\nLet me adjust the schedule:\n\n1. Start at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Golden Gate Park (25 mins) to meet Melissa at 9:25 AM.\n3. Then, head to Richmond District (18 mins) to meet Emily at 4:45 PM.\n4. After that, travel to Presidio (17 mins) to meet Nancy at 7:30 PM.\n\nThis way, the user meets all three friends without backtracking too much. The only issue is the long gap between 4:45 PM and 7:30 PM. Maybe the user can do something else in between, but since they have only three friends, this seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, they could meet Emily first, then Nancy, and then Melissa, but starting with Melissa in the morning seems more efficient.\n\nI think this schedule works best, considering the travel times and the availability of each person. The user can optimize their day by meeting Melissa early, Emily in the afternoon, and Nancy in the evening, ensuring they don't miss any of the meetings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Richmond District\",\n      \"person\": \"Emily\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Presidio\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
