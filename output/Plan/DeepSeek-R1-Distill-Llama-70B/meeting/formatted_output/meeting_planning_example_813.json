            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who's an AI meeting planner. They want to schedule a day of meetings in San Francisco, starting from the Marina District at 9:00 AM. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and constraints. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the travel distances provided. They're all between different areas like Marina District, Embarcadero, Bayview, Union Square, Chinatown, Sunset District, Golden Gate Park, Financial District, Haight-Ashbury, Mission District, and others. The distances vary from 4 minutes to 30 minutes, so planning the order of meetings is crucial to minimize back-and-forth travel.\n\nThe constraints mention that the user arrives at Marina District at 9:00 AM. Then, there are several people with specific times and locations they'll be available. For example, Joshua is at Embarcadero from 9:45 AM to 6:00 PM, which is a long window. Jeffrey is at Bayview until 8:15 PM, and so on.\n\nI need to figure out the optimal sequence of meetings. Starting at Marina District, I should probably go to the earliest available person. But looking at the constraints, the earliest someone is available is Elizabeth at Sunset District at 9:00 AM, but she's only available until 9:45 AM. That's a short window, so maybe I should prioritize others with longer availability.\n\nJoshua at Embarcadero is available from 9:45 AM, which is right after Elizabeth. That seems like a good starting point. From Embarcadero, the next closest location would be either Bayview or Union Square. Jeffrey is at Bayview until 8:15 PM, which is a longer window, so maybe go there next. From Bayview, moving to Union Square makes sense because Charles is there from 10:45 AM, giving enough time to travel.\n\nAfter Union Square, the next locations could be Chinatown or Golden Gate Park. Joseph is in Chinatown until 3:30 PM, which is a good window. Then, moving to Golden Gate Park to meet Matthew, who's there until 7:30 PM. After that, perhaps Financial District to meet Carol, but she's only available until 11:15 AM, so maybe not the best fit.\n\nAlternatively, after Golden Gate Park, going to Haight-Ashbury to meet Paul, who's available from 7:15 PM to 8:30 PM. Then, finally, to Mission District to meet Rebecca. However, the travel times need to be considered to ensure I don't miss any meetings or have too much travel in between.\n\nWait, maybe I should adjust the order. Starting at Marina District, going to Embarcadero first for Joshua, then to Bayview for Jeffrey, then to Union Square for Charles, then to Chinatown for Joseph, then to Golden Gate Park for Matthew, then to Financial District for Carol, but she's only available until 11:15 AM, so maybe that's too early. Alternatively, after Golden Gate Park, go to Haight-Ashbury for Paul, and then to Mission District for Rebecca.\n\nI need to make sure that the travel times between these locations don't exceed the available windows. For example, from Bayview to Union Square, it's 18 minutes, which is manageable. From Union Square to Chinatown is 7 minutes. From Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes. From Golden Gate Park to Haight-Ashbury is 7 minutes. From Haight-Ashbury to Mission District is 11 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the user also needs to consider the time they arrive at each location and the duration of the meetings. For example, if they meet Joshua until 10:00 AM, then need to travel to Bayview, arriving by 10:30 AM, but Jeffrey is available until 8:15 PM, so that's feasible.\n\nI think the best plan is:\n\n1. Marina District at 9:00 AM.\n2. Embarcadero at 9:45 AM to meet Joshua.\n3. Bayview at 10:15 AM to meet Jeffrey.\n4. Union Square at 10:45 AM to meet Charles.\n5. Chinatown at 11:15 AM to meet Joseph.\n6. Golden Gate Park at 11:45 AM to meet Matthew.\n7. Haight-Ashbury at 12:15 PM to meet Paul.\n8. Mission District at 12:45 PM to meet Rebecca.\n\nThis way, each meeting is spaced out with enough travel time, and all the constraints are met.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Charles\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Matthew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\",\n      \"person\": \"Paul\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
