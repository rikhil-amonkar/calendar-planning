            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help this user by creating a meeting plan based on the given constraints and travel distances. The user is an AI meeting planner, and their task is to schedule meetings efficiently, considering travel times and constraints to optimize the schedule. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible.\n\nFirst, I'll review the travel distances provided. The relevant distances here are between Alamo Square and Richmond District, and vice versa. The distances are 12 minutes from Alamo Square to Richmond District and 13 minutes from Richmond District to Alamo Square.\n\nNow, looking at the constraints, the user arrives at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM. The only constraint provided is that Timothy will be at Richmond District from 8:45 PM to 9:30 PM, and the user wants to meet Timothy for a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nGiven that the user arrives at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM, the first thought is to plan a meeting at Alamo Square in the morning. However, since Timothy is only available in the evening, the user needs to travel from Alamo Square to Richmond District in the afternoon.\n\nConsidering the travel distance from Alamo Square to Richmond District is 12 minutes, the user can go from Alamo Square to Richmond District in the early evening, meet Timothy, and then return to Alamo Square if needed. However, since the meeting with Timothy is the only constraint, the plan can be to meet him at Richmond District in the evening.\n\nThe itinerary should include a meeting at Alamo Square in the morning, followed by a trip to Richmond District in the afternoon to meet Timothy. The exact times should be chosen to ensure the travel distance is manageable and the meeting with Timothy is feasible within his availability.\n\nSo, the optimal plan is to meet at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM, travel to Richmond District around 5:00 PM to meet Timothy until 9:30 PM, which gives enough time for a 45-minute meeting. After meeting Timothy, the user can return to Alamo Square if needed, but since there are no other constraints, this seems sufficient.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as per the user's instructions, ensuring the times are in 24-hour format without leading zeros.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"You\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Richmond District\",\n      \"person\": \"Timothy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
