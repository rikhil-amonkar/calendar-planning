            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to schedule my day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible. I've got this AI planning tool, and I need to use it to create an itinerary that's efficient and considers travel times and constraints. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the travel distances provided. They connect various locations like Mission District, Alamo Square, Presidio, Russian Hill, North Beach, Golden Gate Park, Richmond District, Embarcadero, Financial District, Marina District, and Pacific Heights. The distances are in minutes, which helps in planning the timing.\n\nNow, the constraints. I arrive at Mission District at 9:00 AM. Laura will be at Alamo Square from 2:30 PM to 4:15 PM. I need to meet Laura for at least 75 minutes. Brian will be at Presidio from 10:15 AM to 5:00 PM. I need to meet him for 30 minutes. Karen will be at Russian Hill from 6:00 PM to 8:15 PM, requiring 90 minutes with her. Stephanie is at North Beach from 10:15 AM to 4:00 PM, so I need 75 minutes with her. Helen is at Golden Gate Park from 11:30 AM to 9:45 PM, which is a long time, but I need 120 minutes with her. Sandra is at Richmond District from 8:00 AM to 3:15 PM, so 30 minutes. Mary is at Embarcadero from 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM, needing 120 minutes. Deborah is at Financial District from 7:00 PM to 8:45 PM, which is 105 minutes. Elizabeth is at Marina District from 8:30 AM to 1:15 PM, requiring 105 minutes.\n\nLooking at these constraints, I need to figure out the best way to meet all these people without overlapping too much and considering the travel times between locations.\n\nStarting with Laura at Alamo Square, she's available from 2:30 PM to 4:15 PM. That gives me a window of 45 minutes. I need to meet her for 75 minutes, so that might be a bit tight. Maybe I can start my day in a way that allows me to get there in time.\n\nNext, Brian at Presidio from 10:15 AM to 5:00 PM. That's a longer window, so I can probably schedule my day around his time. Karen at Russian Hill from 6:00 PM to 8:15 PM, so I need to make sure I'm there for at least 90 minutes.\n\nStephanie at North Beach from 10:15 AM to 4:00 PM. That's a good chunk of time, so I can plan to meet her in the morning or early afternoon.\n\nHelen at Golden Gate Park from 11:30 AM to 9:45 PM. That's almost the entire day, so I need to prioritize when to meet her for 120 minutes. Maybe in the late afternoon or early evening when she's still there.\n\nSandra at Richmond District from 8:00 AM to 3:15 PM. Early morning to late afternoon availability. I need only 30 minutes, so I can slot that in early.\n\nMary at Embarcadero from 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM. That's a two-hour window, so I can plan a meeting there in the late afternoon.\n\nDeborah at Financial District from 7:00 PM to 8:45 PM. That's a 105-minute window in the evening.\n\nElizabeth at Marina District from 8:30 AM to 1:15 PM. That's a good morning window for a 105-minute meeting.\n\nNow, thinking about the locations, I need to plan the order of meetings in a way that minimizes travel time between them. Starting from Mission District, I can go to Presidio, then to Russian Hill, North Beach, Golden Gate Park, Richmond District, Embarcadero, Financial District, Marina District.\n\nI need to ensure that the time between meetings is manageable, considering the distances. For example, from Mission District to Presidio is 25 minutes, which is feasible. From Presidio to Russian Hill is 14 minutes, and so on.\n\nI should also consider the time each person is available and make sure I don't miss the window. For Laura, I need to be at Alamo Square by 2:30 PM, so I should plan to arrive there before 2:30 PM.\n\nMaybe I can start the day by meeting Sandra early at Richmond District, then move to Presidio for Brian, then to Russian Hill for Karen, followed by North Beach for Stephanie, then to Golden Gate Park for Helen, then to Embarcadero for Mary, Financial District for Deborah, and Marina District for Elizabeth.\n\nI need to check the travel times between these locations to make sure the schedule is efficient. For example, from Richmond District to Presidio is 7 minutes, which is quick. From Presidio to Russian Hill is 14 minutes, manageable.\n\nI also need to make sure that I'm not double-booking myself and that each meeting has the required duration without overlapping too much. For example, meeting Helen for 120 minutes at Golden Gate Park would take up most of the afternoon, so I should plan the rest of the meetings around that.\n\nPerhaps I can meet Laura towards the end of her availability, say at 3:30 PM, giving me enough time to travel to Alamo Square from Golden Gate Park.\n\nSimilarly, meeting Elizabeth at Marina District in the morning, then moving to North Beach for Stephanie, then to Presidio for Brian, etc.\n\nI need to make sure that each meeting starts and ends within the person's availability and that I have enough time to travel to the next location.\n\nIt's a bit complex, but I think with careful planning, I can fit all these meetings into the day without too much stress.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Richmond District\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Presidio\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Deborah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Marina District\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
