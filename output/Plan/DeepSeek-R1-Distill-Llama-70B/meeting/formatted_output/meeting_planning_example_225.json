            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to schedule meetings in San Francisco efficiently, considering travel times and constraints. They want to meet as many friends as possible, so maximizing the number of meetings while respecting the time constraints is key.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the travel distances provided. The distances are between various locations like Sunset District, North Beach, Union Square, Alamo Square, etc. The distances vary, so I'll need to plan the order of meetings based on proximity to minimize travel time.\n\nLooking at the constraints, the user arrives at Sunset District at 9:00AM. There are three people to meet: Sarah at North Beach from 4:00PM to 6:15PM, Jeffrey at Union Square from 3:00PM to 10:00PM, and Brian at Alamo Square from 4:00PM to 5:30PM.\n\nI need to figure out the optimal sequence to visit these locations. Starting from Sunset District, I should plan to go to the closest location first. The distances show that Union Square is 30 minutes away, Alamo Square is 17 minutes, and North Beach is 29 minutes.\n\nBut considering the time constraints, let's see:\n\n- If I go to Alamo Square first (17 minutes), then to Union Square (30 minutes), then to North Beach (29 minutes). But Brian is available from 4:00PM to 5:30PM, so I can meet him at Alamo Square at 4:00PM. Then, Jeffrey is available from 3:00PM, but if I go to Union Square after Alamo Square, I can meet him anytime after 4:00PM. Sarah is available from 4:00PM, so I can meet her at North Beach after meeting Jeffrey and Brian.\n\nWait, but the travel time from Alamo Square to Union Square is 30 minutes, which might be tight if I have other meetings. Alternatively, maybe I should go to Union Square first, then Alamo Square, and then North Beach.\n\nLet me outline the possible schedules:\n\nOption 1:\n- 9:00AM: Start at Sunset District.\n- 9:00-9:17: Travel to Alamo Square (17 minutes).\n- 9:17-9:44: Meet Brian at Alamo Square (4:00-5:30PM).\n- 9:44-10:14: Travel to Union Square (30 minutes).\n- 10:14-10:44: Meet Jeffrey at Union Square (3:00-10:00PM).\n- 10:44-11:14: Travel to North Beach (29 minutes).\n- 11:14-11:44: Meet Sarah at North Beach (4:00-6:15PM).\n\nBut this schedule is too tight because the user can't be in two places at once. They need to travel between locations, which takes time.\n\nOption 2:\n- 9:00-9:17: Travel to Union Square (30 minutes).\n- 9:17-9:44: Meet Jeffrey at Union Square (3:00-10:00PM).\n- 9:44-10:14: Travel to Alamo Square (30 minutes).\n- 10:14-10:44: Meet Brian at Alamo Square (4:00-5:30PM).\n- 10:44-11:14: Travel to North Beach (29 minutes).\n- 11:14-11:44: Meet Sarah at North Beach (4:00-6:15PM).\n\nThis seems better because the user can meet Jeffrey first, then Brian, and finally Sarah. The travel times are manageable because the user can move from Union Square to Alamo Square and then to North Beach without overlapping meeting times.\n\nI should also consider the return trip, but since the user is only visiting for the day, maybe they don't need to return. However, if they do, the travel time back to Sunset District from North Beach is 29 minutes.\n\nSo, the final schedule would be:\n\n1. Visit Union Square at 9:17AM to meet Jeffrey.\n2. Travel to Alamo Square by 10:14AM to meet Brian.\n3. Travel to North Beach by 11:14AM to meet Sarah.\n\nThis way, all meetings are within the required time constraints and the user can maximize the number of friends met.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:17\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:17\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:14\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:14\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:14\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:14\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
