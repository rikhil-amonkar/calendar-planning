            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help this user schedule their meetings in San Francisco. Let me see what they've provided. They've given me travel distances between various locations and some constraints about their availability.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the constraints. The user arrives at the Financial District at 9:00 AM. They have two main people to meet: Kenneth in Chinatown from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and Barbara at the Golden Gate Park from 8:15 AM to 7:00 PM.\n\nMy goal is to meet both Kenneth and Barbara with the minimum required time, and also to minimize travel time between locations. The user wants to meet as many friends as possible, so ideally, I should schedule meetings that are close to each other in time and location.\n\nLooking at the travel distances, I see that the Financial District to Chinatown is 5 minutes, and Financial District to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes. Conversely, Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is also 23 minutes. Golden Gate Park to Financial District is 26 minutes, and Golden Gate Park to Chinatown is 23 minutes.\n\nSince the user starts at the Financial District, I need to decide whether to go to Chinatown first or the Golden Gate Park. If I go to Chinatown first, the travel time is 5 minutes, and then from Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes. Alternatively, going to Golden Gate Park first would take 23 minutes, and then from there to Chinatown is another 23 minutes. \n\nConsidering that Kenneth is available from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, I need to make sure that the meeting time with him doesn't exceed the minimum of 90 minutes. Similarly, Barbara is available from 8:15 AM to 7:00 PM, so there's a lot of flexibility there.\n\nIf I go to Chinatown first, I can meet Kenneth starting at 12:00 PM, which gives me 3 hours, well within the 90-minute requirement. Then, after that, I can head to the Golden Gate Park to meet Barbara. The travel time from Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to the Golden Gate Park first, I could meet Barbara as early as 8:15 AM, but that might not be ideal if I want to maximize the time with Kenneth. However, since the user wants to meet as many friends as possible, maybe it's better to meet Barbara first and then Kenneth.\n\nBut wait, the user arrives at 9:00 AM, so if I go to the Golden Gate Park first, I can meet Barbara at 9:00 AM, which is within her availability. Then, from there to Chinatown is 23 minutes, arriving at 9:23 AM. I can then meet Kenneth starting at 12:00 PM, which would give me 2 hours, which is still within the 90-minute requirement.\n\nHowever, considering the travel times and the need to minimize backtracking, maybe it's better to go to Chinatown first since it's closer to the Financial District. That way, the user can meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM and then travel to the Golden Gate Park for Barbara, arriving by 12:23 PM, which is within her availability.\n\nWait, but if I meet Kenneth at 12:00 PM, I need to make sure that the meeting duration is at least 90 minutes. So, starting at 12:00 PM, ending at 1:30 PM would be ideal. Then, from Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes, arriving at 1:23 PM, which is still within Barbara's availability.\n\nAlternatively, if I meet Barbara first, starting at 8:15 AM, ending at 9:00 AM, then travel to Chinatown, arriving at 9:05 AM, and then meet Kenneth starting at 12:00 PM, which would give me 2 hours with Kenneth, ending at 1:00 PM. That seems feasible as well.\n\nBut since the user arrives at 9:00 AM, meeting Barbara at 8:15 AM might be a bit too early unless the user is comfortable with that. It might be better to meet Kenneth first since he has a specific time window.\n\nSo, the optimal schedule would be:\n\n1. Meet Kenneth in Chinatown starting at 12:00 PM, ending at 1:30 PM.\n2. Travel from Chinatown to Golden Gate Park, arriving at 1:23 PM.\n3. Meet Barbara in Golden Gate Park, starting at 1:30 PM, ending at 2:15 PM.\n\nThis way, the user meets both Kenneth and Barbara within their available time windows, with sufficient time in between for travel. Also, the total time spent is 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is efficient.\n\nI should also check if there's any other friend the user wants to meet, but from the constraints provided, it seems only Kenneth and Barbara are the main ones. Therefore, this schedule should work best.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"12:00\", \"end_time\": \"13:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"13:30\", \"end_time\": \"14:15\"}\n  ]\n}",
