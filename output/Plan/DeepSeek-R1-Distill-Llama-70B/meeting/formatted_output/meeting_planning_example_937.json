They want to meet as many friends as possible, so I should prioritize the friends who can be reached with the least travel time and without overlapping meeting times.\n\nLooking at the constraints, I see several friends with specific time slots. I'll list them out:\n\n1. **David** is at Sunset District from 9:15 AM to 10:00 PM. They need only 15 minutes.\n2. **Kenneth** is at Union Square from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. Another quick meeting.\n3. **Patricia** is at Nob Hill from 3:00 PM to 7:15 PM. She needs 120 minutes.\n4. **Mary** is at Marina District from 2:45 PM to 4:45 PM. 45 minutes.\n5. **Charles** is at Richmond District from 5:15 PM to 9:00 PM. 15 minutes.\n6. **Joshua** is at Financial District from 2:30 PM to 5:15 PM. 90 minutes.\n7. **Ronald** is at Embarcadero from 6:15 PM to 8:45 PM. 30 minutes.\n8. **George** is at The Castro from 2:15 PM to 7:00 PM. 105 minutes.\n9. **Kimberly** is at Alamo Square from 9:00 AM to 2:30 PM. 105 minutes.\n10. **William** is at Presidio from 7:00 AM to 12:45 PM. 60 minutes.\n\nStarting with the earliest possible meetings, **David** is at Sunset District from 9:15 AM. Since I arrive at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM, I need to travel to Sunset District. The travel time from Russian Hill to Sunset District is 24 minutes. I can meet David at 9:15 AM, ending at 9:30 AM.\n\nNext, **Kenneth** is at Union Square from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. I'll need to travel from Russian Hill to Union Square, which takes 13 minutes. If I go there after some other meetings, maybe around 9:15 PM. But I have to check if I can make it without missing other meetings.\n\nThen, **Kimberly** is at Alamo Square from 9:00 AM to 2:30 PM. She's available until 2:30 PM, so I can meet her later. Let's see what's feasible.\n\n**William** is at Presidio until 12:45 PM. Traveling from Russian Hill to Presidio is 14 minutes. Meeting him around 10:00 AM would work, ending at 10:30 AM.\n\n**Joshua** is at Financial District from 2:30 PM to 5:15 PM. He needs 90 minutes. I can meet him around 3:00 PM, but I need to check the travel time from my current location.\n\n**Mary** is at Marina District from 2:45 PM to 4:45 PM. 45 minutes. I can meet her around 3:30 PM, after Joshua.\n\n**George** is at The Castro from 2:15 PM to 7:00 PM. He needs 105 minutes.

Meeting him around 8:15 PM.\n\nI need to make sure each meeting ends before the next starts, considering travel times.
