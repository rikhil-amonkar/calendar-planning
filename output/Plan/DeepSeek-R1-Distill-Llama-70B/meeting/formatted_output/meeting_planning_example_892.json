            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a series of constraints and travel distances, and they want an optimal meeting schedule. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The user arrives at Marina District at 9:00 AM. They have to meet several people, each with specific time windows and locations. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings while respecting the travel times and the minimum meeting durations.\n\nLooking at the first constraint, Charles is at Bayview from 11:30 AM to 2:30 PM. Since the user is at Marina District, I need to find the best time to travel to Bayview. The travel distance from Marina District to Bayview is 27 minutes. So, the user can leave Marina District at 11:00 AM, arrive at Bayview by 11:30 AM, just in time to meet Charles for 45 minutes until 12:15 PM. That seems efficient.\n\nNext, Robert is at Sunset District from 4:45 PM to 9:00 PM. The travel time from Bayview to Sunset District is 23 minutes. After meeting Charles, the user can head to Sunset District. The earliest they can leave Bayview is around 12:15 PM, arriving in Sunset District by 12:45 PM. But Robert isn't available until 4:45 PM. So, the user has a long gap. Maybe the user can do another meeting in between.\n\nKaren is at Richmond District from 7:15 PM to 9:30 PM. The travel time from Sunset District to Richmond District is 12 minutes. If Robert's meeting ends at 9:00 PM, the user can go to Richmond District afterward. But Karen is available until 9:30 PM, so the user can meet her at 9:00 PM, but that's only 30 minutes. However, the user might prefer to meet someone else in the meantime.\n\nRebecca is at Nob Hill from 4:15 PM to 8:30 PM. The travel time from Sunset District to Nob Hill is 24 minutes. If the user leaves Sunset District at 4:45 PM, they can arrive in Nob Hill by 5:15 PM. Rebecca is available until 8:30 PM, so the user can meet her for 90 minutes. That seems feasible.\n\nMargaret is at Chinatown from 2:15 PM to 7:45 PM. The travel time from Sunset District to Chinatown is 30 minutes. If the user leaves Sunset District at 4:45 PM, they can arrive in Chinatown by 5:15 PM. Margaret is available until 7:45 PM, allowing for a 120-minute meeting. That's a good opportunity.\n\nPatricia is at Haight-Ashbury from 2:30 PM to 8:30 PM. The travel time from Sunset District to Haight-Ashbury is 15 minutes. If the user leaves Sunset District at 4:45 PM, they can arrive in Haight-Ashbury by 5:00 PM. Patricia is available until 8:30 PM, so the user can meet her for 45 minutes. However, the user might prefer to meet someone else during this time.\n\nMark is at North Beach from 2:00 PM to 6:30 PM. The travel time from Sunset District to North Beach is 28 minutes. If the user leaves Sunset District at 4:45 PM, they can arrive in North Beach by 5:15 PM. Mark is available until 6:30 PM, allowing for a 105-minute meeting. That's a long meeting, but it might be worth it.\n\nMelissa is at Russian Hill from 1:00 PM to 7:45 PM. The travel time from Sunset District to Russian Hill is 24 minutes. If the user leaves Sunset District at 4:45 PM, they can arrive in Russian Hill by 5:15 PM. Melissa is available until 7:45 PM, allowing for a 30-minute meeting. It's a short meeting, but perhaps the user can manage.\n\nLaura is at Embarcadero from 7:45 AM to 1:15 PM. The travel time from Marina District to Embarcadero is 14 minutes. Since the user arrives at Marina District at 9:00 AM, they can leave immediately and arrive at Embarcadero by 9:14 AM. Laura is available until 1:15 PM, allowing for a 105-minute meeting. That's a good start.\n\nPutting it all together, the user should first meet Laura at Embarcadero from 9:00 AM to 10:05 AM. Then, travel to Bayview to meet Charles from 11:30 AM to 12:15 PM. After that, head to Sunset District to meet Robert from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM. Then, go to Chinatown to meet Margaret from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM. Finally, travel to Haight-Ashbury to meet Patricia from 8:30 PM to 9:15 PM. This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the number of meetings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:05\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"person\": \"Charles\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Sunset District\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Margaret\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\",\n      \"person\": \"Patricia\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
