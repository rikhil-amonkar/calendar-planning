            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The user wants to maximize the number of meetings while considering travel times and constraints. They've provided a detailed setup with specific locations, travel distances, and availability windows for each person.\n\nFirst, I'll start by identifying the key constraints. The user arrives at Chinatown at 9:00 AM, which is the starting point. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, so I need to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping times and considering the travel distances.\n\nLooking at the constraints, the user has several friends spread across different areas. Each friend has a specific time window available. My task is to pick the best times and locations to meet as many as possible.\n\nI'll list out all the people and their available time windows:\n\n1. **Richard** - Embarcadero from 3:15 PM to 6:45 PM.\n2. **Mark** - Pacific Heights from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n3. **Matthew** - Russian Hill from 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM.\n4. **Rebecca** - Haight-Ashbury from 2:45 PM to 6:00 PM.\n5. **Melissa** - Golden Gate Park from 1:45 PM to 5:30 PM.\n6. **Margaret** - Fisherman's Wharf from 2:45 PM to 8:15 PM.\n7. **Emily** - Sunset District from 3:45 PM to 5:00 PM.\n8. **George** - The Castro from 2:00 PM to 4:15 PM.\n\nNext, I need to consider the travel times from Chinatown to each of these locations. The goal is to ensure that the user can move efficiently between meetings without spending too much time traveling, which would cut into the meeting times.\n\nStarting with the earliest available time, **George** is at The Castro from 2:00 PM to 4:15 PM. Chinatown to The Castro is 22 minutes, which seems manageable. If the user leaves Chinatown at 2:00 PM, they can arrive at 2:22 PM and meet George until 4:15 PM.\n\nAfter meeting George, the next earliest time would be **Rebecca** in Haight-Ashbury, who is available from 2:45 PM to 6:00 PM. The travel time from The Castro to Haight-Ashbury is 15 minutes, so leaving at 4:15 PM would arrive at 4:30 PM, allowing a meeting until 6:00 PM.\n\nNext, **Melissa** is at Golden Gate Park from 1:45 PM to 5:30 PM. However, since the user can't go back in time, the next available time after 6:00 PM would be 6:00 PM. The travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Golden Gate Park is 7 minutes, so the user can meet Melissa from 6:00 PM to 6:07 PM, but that's quite short. Alternatively, perhaps a different order would work better.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider overlapping times. For example, **Melissa** is available until 5:30 PM, so if the user can make it to Golden Gate Park before 5:30 PM, that might be better. Let's see.\n\nIf the user meets George until 4:15 PM, then goes to Golden Gate Park, which is 22 minutes from Chinatown. Wait, no, from The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 7 minutes. So leaving at 4:15 PM, arrives at 4:22 PM, and can meet Melissa until 5:30 PM. That seems better.\n\nThen, after meeting Melissa, the next available time would be **Emily** in Sunset District from 3:45 PM to 5:00 PM. But since the user can't go back in time, perhaps it's better to skip her for now and look for other meetings.\n\nNext, **Mark** is at Pacific Heights from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Pacific Heights is 15 minutes. If the user leaves Golden Gate Park at 5:30 PM, they can arrive at 5:45 PM and meet Mark until 5:00 PM, which doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe the user can rearrange to meet Mark earlier.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting George and Melissa, the user could go to Pacific Heights to meet Mark. Let's check the timings:\n\n- Meet George until 4:15 PM.\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park, arrive by 4:22 PM.\n- Meet Melissa until 5:30 PM.\n- Then travel to Pacific Heights, which is 15 minutes, arriving at 5:45 PM. But Mark is only available until 5:00 PM, so that's too late.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to meet Mark earlier. Let's try:\n\n- Meet George until 4:15 PM.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights, arriving at 4:15 + 22 minutes = 4:37 PM.\n- Meet Mark until 5:00 PM.\n- Then, travel to Golden Gate Park, which is 15 minutes, arriving at 5:15 PM. But Melissa is available until 5:30 PM, so the user can meet her from 5:15 PM to 5:30 PM.\n\nThat seems better. So:\n\n1. Meet George at The Castro from 2:00 PM to 4:15 PM.\n2. Travel to Pacific Heights, meet Mark from 4:37 PM to 5:00 PM.\n3. Travel to Golden Gate Park, meet Melissa from 5:15 PM to 5:30 PM.\n\nNext, **Richard** is at Embarcadero from 3:15 PM to 6:45 PM. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Embarcadero is 25 minutes. If the user leaves Golden Gate Park at 5:30 PM, arrives at 5:55 PM, and can meet Richard until 6:45 PM.\n\nThen, **Matthew** is at Russian Hill from 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM. The travel time from Embarcadero to Russian Hill is 8 minutes. If the user leaves Embarcadero at 6:45 PM, arrives at 6:53 PM, and can meet Matthew until 9:00 PM.\n\nAfter that, **Rebecca** is at Haight-Ashbury from 2:45 PM to 6:00 PM. But the user has already met Melissa and George, so maybe it's better to skip Rebecca unless there's time.\n\nWait, let's see. After meeting Matthew, the user could go to Haight-Ashbury to meet Rebecca, but the travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. If the user leaves Russian Hill at 9:00 PM, arrives at 9:17 PM, but Rebecca is only available until 6:00 PM. That's too late.\n\nSo perhaps it's better to prioritize the earlier meetings and skip Rebecca.\n\nSimilarly, **Emily** is at Sunset District from 3:45 PM to 5:00 PM. The user could go to Sunset District after meeting Melissa, but let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Melissa at 5:30 PM, the user could go to Sunset District, which is 11 minutes from Golden Gate Park. Arriving at 5:41 PM, but Emily is only available until 5:00 PM. So that's too late.\n\nTherefore, the best plan is:\n\n1. Meet George at The Castro from 2:00 PM to 4:15 PM.\n2. Travel to Pacific Heights, meet Mark from 4:37 PM to 5:00 PM.\n3. Travel to Golden Gate Park, meet Melissa from 5:15 PM to 5:30 PM.\n4. Travel to Embarcadero, meet Richard from 5:55 PM to 6:45 PM.\n5. Travel to Russian Hill, meet Matthew from 6:53 PM to 9:00 PM.\n\nThis way, the user meets five people: George, Mark, Melissa, Richard, and Matthew. That's five meetings, which is the maximum possible given the constraints.\n\nI need to ensure that the travel times between these meetings are reasonable and don't exceed the available meeting times. The user can manage the travel times efficiently between these locations, so this schedule should work.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"The Castro\",\n      \"person\": \"George\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:37\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:55\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Matthew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:53\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
