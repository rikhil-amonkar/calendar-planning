            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. I need to schedule a day of meetings in San Francisco, starting from The Castro. I want to meet as many friends as possible, considering the travel distances and the constraints provided. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the constraints. I arrive at The Castro at 9:00 AM. The friends I need to meet have specific time windows and locations. I need to ensure that each meeting starts and ends within the required time, and that the travel time between meetings is minimized to maximize the number of meetings.\n\nI'll start by listing all the friends and their available times:\n\n1. **Emily** - Russian Hill from 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM\n2. **Mark** - Presidio from 2:45 PM to 7:30 PM\n3. **Deborah** - Chinatown from 7:30 AM to 3:30 PM\n4. **Margaret** - Sunset District from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM\n5. **George** - The Castro from 7:30 AM to 2:15 PM\n6. **Andrew** - Embarcadero from 8:15 PM to 10:00 PM\n7. **Steven** - Golden Gate Park from 11:15 AM to 9:15 PM\n\nI need to meet each of them for a minimum of 15-120 minutes. To maximize the number of meetings, I'll try to fit them into my schedule without overlapping too much.\n\nStarting with the earliest available time, **George** is at The Castro from 7:30 AM to 2:15 PM. Since I'm already at The Castro, I can meet him first. Let's say I meet him at 9:00 AM for an hour. That gives me:\n\n- **George**: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM\n\nNext, I can go to **Deborah** in Chinatown. The travel time from The Castro to Chinatown is 19 minutes. She's available from 7:30 AM to 3:30 PM. If I leave The Castro at 10:00 AM, I can meet her around 10:19 AM, but that might be tight. Alternatively, I can meet her earlier. Let's say I meet her at 10:00 AM for 30 minutes.\n\n- **Deborah**: 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM\n\nAfter that, I can go to **Emily** in Russian Hill. The travel time from Chinatown to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. Emily is available from 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM. If I leave Chinatown at 10:30 AM, I can meet her at 10:37 AM, but that's before her available time. So, I'll have to wait until 12:15 PM. Let's meet her for 45 minutes.\n\n- **Emily**: 12:15 PM - 1:00 PM\n\nThen, I can go to **Mark** in Presidio. The travel time from Russian Hill to Presidio is 14 minutes. Mark is available from 2:45 PM to 7:30 PM. If I leave Russian Hill at 1:00 PM, I can meet him at 1:14 PM, but that's before his available time. So, I'll have to wait until 2:45 PM. Let's meet him for 60 minutes.\n\n- **Mark**: 2:45 PM - 3:45 PM\n\nAfter that, I can go to **Steven** in Golden Gate Park. The travel time from Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. Steven is available from 11:15 AM to 9:15 PM. If I leave Presidio at 3:45 PM, I can meet him at 3:56 PM, but that's after his available time. So, I'll have to meet him earlier. Let's meet him at 11:15 AM for 30 minutes.\n\n- **Steven**: 11:15 AM - 11:45 AM\n\nWait, but I already met George at 9:00 AM and Deborah at 10:00 AM. Meeting Steven at 11:15 AM might be too early. Maybe I should adjust the schedule.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Mark, I can go to **Andrew** in Embarcadero. The travel time from Presidio to Embarcadero is 20 minutes. Andrew is available from 8:15 PM to 10:00 PM. If I leave Presidio at 3:45 PM, I can meet him at 4:05 PM, but that's after his available time. So, I'll have to meet him later. Let's meet him at 8:15 PM for 45 minutes.\n\n- **Andrew**: 8:15 PM - 8:60 PM (but that's after his available time). Hmm, maybe I need to adjust.\n\nFinally, I can go to **Margaret** in Sunset District. The travel time from Embarcadero to Sunset District is 31 minutes. Margaret is available from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM. If I leave Embarcadero at 8:15 PM, I can meet her at 8:46 PM, but that's before her available time. So, I'll have to meet her at 9:30 PM for 60 minutes.\n\n- **Margaret**: 9:30 PM - 10:30 PM\n\nWait, but I have to ensure that each meeting is at least the minimum required time and that the travel times are considered. Let me try to outline the schedule step by step, considering the travel times and the friends' availability.\n\nStarting at The Castro at 9:00 AM:\n\n1. **George** - The Castro from 7:30 AM to 2:15 PM. I can meet him at 9:00 AM for 1 hour.\n\n   - **George**: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM\n\n2. From The Castro to Chinatown (19 minutes). Meet **Deborah** at 10:00 AM for 30 minutes.\n\n   - **Deborah**: 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM\n\n3. From Chinatown to Russian Hill (7 minutes). Meet **Emily** at 12:15 PM for 45 minutes.\n\n   - **Emily**: 12:15 PM - 1:00 PM\n\n4. From Russian Hill to Presidio (14 minutes). Meet **Mark** at 2:45 PM for 60 minutes.\n\n   - **Mark**: 2:45 PM - 3:45 PM\n\n5. From Presidio to Golden Gate Park (11 minutes). Meet **Steven** at 4:00 PM for 30 minutes.\n\n   - **Steven**: 4:00 PM - 4:30 PM\n\n6. From Golden Gate Park to Embarcadero (25 minutes). Meet **Andrew** at 5:15 PM for 45 minutes.\n\n   - **Andrew**: 5:15 PM - 5:60 PM (but Andrew is available until 10:00 PM, so this works.)\n\n7. From Embarcadero to Sunset District (31 minutes). Meet **Margaret** at 9:30 PM for 60 minutes.\n\n   - **Margaret**: 9:30 PM - 10:30 PM\n\nThis seems to fit all the constraints. Each meeting is within the required time, and the travel times are accounted for. I think this is a feasible schedule.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"The Castro\",\n      \"person\": \"George\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Deborah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Emily\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Presidio\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Steven\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"person\": \"Andrew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:60\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Sunset District\",\n      \"person\": \"Margaret\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
