            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help this user schedule their meetings in San Francisco. They've been giving me a series of travel distance data and constraints for each meeting. My job is to figure out the best time to meet each person considering the travel times and the constraints.\n\nFirst, I should look at where the user arrives and who they need to meet. In this case, the user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. They have three people to meet: Emily at Presidio, Joseph at Richmond District, and Melissa at Financial District. Each has specific time windows they're available.\n\nEmily is at Presidio from 4:15 PM to 9:00 PM. That's a pretty long window, but since the user arrives early, I need to see when they can meet Emily without making Emily wait too long. The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Presidio is 17 minutes. So, if the user leaves Fisherman's Wharf at, say, 3:00 PM, they'd arrive at Presidio by 3:17 PM. That would give Emily plenty of time before she leaves at 4:15 PM. So, a meeting time around 3:30 PM seems reasonable.\n\nNext, Joseph is at Richmond District from 5:15 PM to 10:00 PM. The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District is 18 minutes. If the user leaves Fisherman's Wharf at 5:00 PM, they'd arrive at 5:18 PM, which is right when Joseph is available. That works well.\n\nThen, Melissa is at Financial District from 3:45 PM to 9:45 PM. The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Financial District is 10 minutes. If the user leaves Fisherman's Wharf at 3:45 PM, they'd arrive at 3:55 PM, just in time to meet Melissa.\n\nI also need to consider that the user wants to meet as many friends as possible, so I should try to fit all three meetings into the day without too much backtracking. The user is starting at Fisherman's Wharf, so the first meeting should be the closest. Melissa is in the Financial District, which is only 10 minutes away, so that's a good starting point.\n\nAfter meeting Melissa, the user can head to Richmond District to meet Joseph. From Financial District to Richmond District, the travel time is 21 minutes. If they leave Financial District at 5:00 PM, they'll arrive at 5:21 PM, right when Joseph is available.\n\nFinally, the user can go to Presidio to meet Emily. From Richmond District to Presidio, the travel time is 7 minutes. If they leave Richmond District at 4:15 PM, they'll arrive at Presidio by 4:22 PM, giving them enough time to meet Emily before she leaves at 4:15 PM.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If they leave Richmond District at 4:15 PM, they'll arrive at Presidio at 4:22 PM, but Emily is available until 4:15 PM. That's a problem. They need to arrive before 4:15 PM to meet Emily. So maybe they should leave Richmond District earlier. If they leave at 3:45 PM, they'd arrive at Presidio at 3:52 PM, which is well before Emily leaves. That works better.\n\nSo, the revised plan would be:\n1. Meet Melissa at Financial District at 3:45 PM.\n2. Leave Financial District at 3:45 PM, arrive at Richmond District at 4:06 PM.\n3. Meet Joseph at Richmond District from 4:15 PM to 10:00 PM. So, they can meet him at 4:15 PM.\n4. Leave Richmond District at 4:15 PM, arrive at Presidio at 4:22 PM.\n5. Meet Emily at Presidio from 4:15 PM to 9:00 PM. They can meet her at 4:22 PM.\n\nThis way, all three meetings are scheduled without any overlaps or conflicts, and the user can meet all three friends within the day.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:35\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Richmond District\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Presidio\",\n      \"person\": \"Emily\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
