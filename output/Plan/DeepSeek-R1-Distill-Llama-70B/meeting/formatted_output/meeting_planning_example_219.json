            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an AI meeting planner. They need to schedule meetings in San Francisco, starting from The Castro at 9 AM. They want to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the travel distances provided. The locations involved are The Castro, Alamo Square, Union Square, and Chinatown. The distances between these places are given in minutes, which I assume are travel times by public transport or walking.\n\nThe constraints say that Emily is available at Alamo Square from 11:45 AM to 3:15 PM, Barbara is at Union Square from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM, and William is at Chinatown from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM. Each meeting requires a minimum time with the person.\n\nMy goal is to maximize the number of meetings while ensuring each meeting fits within the person's available time and the travel time between locations is considered.\n\nStarting from The Castro at 9 AM, the first thought is to meet someone nearby. But looking at the travel distances, The Castro is close to Alamo Square (8 minutes), Union Square (19 minutes), and Chinatown (20 minutes). However, since Emily is at Alamo Square from 11:45 AM, maybe starting with her makes sense.\n\nIf I meet Emily at Alamo Square, the travel time from The Castro is 8 minutes. The earliest she's available is at 11:45 AM. So, I can plan the meeting to start at 11:45 AM and end by 3:15 PM, but she needs at least 105 minutes. That would mean the meeting should end by 3:00 PM to give her a 105-minute window. However, the next meeting has to be scheduled after that.\n\nAfter meeting Emily, the next option is to go to Union Square to meet Barbara. The travel time from Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 minutes. Barbara is available from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM, so I need to ensure that the meeting time doesn't conflict with her availability and the travel time allows it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Emily, I can go to Chinatown to meet William, but the travel time from Alamo Square to Chinatown is 17 minutes, and William is available from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM. However, this might be too late if I need to go to Union Square next.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider meeting William first. He's available earlier, from 5:15 PM, but that's after Emily's meeting. So, maybe meeting Emily first, then William, then Barbara.\n\nBut let's see the timings. Meeting Emily from 11:45 AM to 3:00 PM, then traveling to Chinatown, which takes 17 minutes, arriving around 3:17 PM. William is available until 7:00 PM, so I can meet him from 3:17 PM to 5:15 PM, which is 105 minutes. Then, from Chinatown, going to Union Square, which takes 20 minutes, arriving around 5:37 PM. Barbara is available from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM, so I can meet her from 5:37 PM to 6:15 PM, but that's only 38 minutes, which is too short. She needs at least 60 minutes.\n\nHmm, that doesn't work. Maybe I need to adjust the schedule. What if I meet Barbara first? She's available from 4:45 PM. But I need to get to Union Square from The Castro, which takes 19 minutes. If I leave The Castro at 4:45 PM, I'd arrive at 5:04 PM, but Barbara is available until 6:15 PM. So, meeting her from 5:04 PM to 6:15 PM gives her 71 minutes, which is enough. Then, from Union Square, going to Alamo Square, which is 14 minutes, arriving around 5:18 PM. Emily is available until 3:15 PM, so that's too late.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meeting Barbara after Emily. After meeting Emily until 3:00 PM, then going to Union Square, arriving at 3:19 PM. Barbara is available from 4:45 PM, so I can meet her from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM, giving her 90 minutes. Then, from Union Square, going to Chinatown, which takes 20 minutes, arriving at 6:05 PM. William is available until 7:00 PM, so I can meet him from 6:05 PM to 7:00 PM, which is 55 minutes, which is too short as he needs 105 minutes.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe I need to prioritize the meetings based on the required time. William needs 105 minutes, Emily needs 105 minutes, and Barbara needs 60 minutes. So, perhaps meeting William first, then Emily, then Barbara.\n\nStarting at The Castro, going to Chinatown, which takes 20 minutes, arriving at 9:20 AM. But William is available from 5:15 PM, so that's too early. Alternatively, after meeting someone else.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to meet Emily first at Alamo Square from 11:45 AM to 3:00 PM, then go to Chinatown to meet William from 3:17 PM to 5:15 PM, then to Union Square to meet Barbara from 5:37 PM to 6:37 PM. But Barbara only needs 60 minutes, so meeting from 5:37 PM to 6:37 PM gives her 60 minutes, which is acceptable. However, the travel time from Chinatown to Union Square is 20 minutes, so arriving at 5:37 PM, meeting until 6:37 PM, then leaving to go back might not be necessary as it's the last meeting.\n\nBut wait, the user might want to end the day after the last meeting. So, perhaps the final meeting can end at 6:37 PM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meeting Barbara first is better. Starting at The Castro, going to Union Square, arriving at 9:19 AM. But Barbara is available from 4:45 PM, so that's too early. Alternatively, leaving The Castro later.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal schedule is:\n\n1.

Travel to Union Square, arrive at 5:37 PM, meet Barbara from 5:37 PM to 6:37 PM.\n\nThis way, each meeting is within the required time, and the travel times are accounted for.\n\nBut let me double-check the timings:\n\n- Meeting Emily from 11:45 AM to 3:00 PM (105 minutes).\n- Travel from Alamo Square to Chinatown: 17 minutes, arriving at 3:17 PM.\n- Meeting William from 3:17 PM to 5:15 PM (105 minutes).\n- Travel from Chinatown to Union Square: 20 minutes, arriving at 5:37 PM.\n- Meeting Barbara from 5:37 PM to 6:37 PM (60 minutes).\n\nThis seems to fit all the constraints. Each meeting starts and ends within the required time frames, and the travel times are included between the meetings.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Emily at Alamo Square from 11:45 AM to 3:00 PM.\n2. Travel to Chinatown, meet William from 3:17 PM to 5:15 PM.\n3. Travel to Union Square, meet Barbara from 5:37 PM to 6:37 PM.\n\nThis way, all meetings are scheduled efficiently without overlapping and considering travel times.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Emily\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"person\": \"William\", \"start_time\": \"15:00\", \"end_time\": \"16:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Union Square\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"16:30\", \"end_time\": \"17:30\"}\n  ]\n}",
