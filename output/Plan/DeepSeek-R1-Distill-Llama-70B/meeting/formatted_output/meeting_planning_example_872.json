            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to schedule a day's worth of meetings in San Francisco for someone who's visiting the city. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible by efficiently planning the meetings, considering travel times and constraints. The user has provided a bunch of travel distances between different locations, which is helpful, but the main challenge is figuring out the best times and places to meet each person without overlapping or causing too much travel fatigue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The user arrives at Presidio at 9:00 AM. Then, there are several people spread out across different neighborhoods with specific time windows when they're available. Some meetings require longer durations, while others are shorter. The key is to maximize the number of meetings without making the traveler too exhausted or overlapping with others' availability.\n\nLooking at the constraints, the traveler wants to meet Karen at Haight-Ashbury, Jessica at Nob Hill, Brian at Russian Hill, Kenneth at North Beach, Jason at Chinatown, Stephanie at Union Square, Kimberly at Embarcadero, Steven at Financial District, and Mark at Marina District. Each of these people has specific time slots available, and the traveler needs to fit these into their day without backtracking too much.\n\nI think the first step is to list out all the people and their available time windows. Then, try to schedule the meetings in a logical order, considering proximity to each other to minimize travel time. For example, if the traveler starts at Presidio, they can go to nearby areas first before venturing further away.\n\nStarting with Karen at Haight-Ashbury, who's available from 9:00 PM to 9:45 PM. Since the traveler arrives at Presidio at 9:00 AM, the earliest they can meet Karen is in the evening. But maybe it's better to save this for later to have more flexibility in the morning and early afternoon.\n\nNext, Jessica at Nob Hill is available from 1:45 PM to 9:00 PM. Nob Hill is relatively close to Presidio, so maybe the traveler can visit Nob Hill after their initial arrival. Jessica's availability is quite long, so this could be a good opportunity to have a longer meeting.\n\nBrian at Russian Hill is available from 3:30 PM to 9:45 PM. Russian Hill is also close to Presidio, so the traveler can go there after Nob Hill. Brian's meeting requires 60 minutes, which is manageable within his availability.\n\nKenneth at North Beach is available from 9:45 AM to 9:00 PM. Since Kenneth is available all day, the traveler could potentially meet him early on, but since the traveler arrives at 9:00 AM, meeting Kenneth at North Beach right away might be feasible. However, North Beach is a bit further from Presidio, so the traveler might want to save that for later if possible.\n\nJason at Chinatown is available from 8:15 AM to 11:45 AM. Chinatown is centrally located, making it a good option for an early morning meeting. The traveler can head there after arriving at Presidio.\n\nStephanie at Union Square is available from 2:45 PM to 6:45 PM. Union Square is a central location, so this could be a good mid-day meeting. The traveler can go there after visiting Chinatown or another nearby location.\n\nKimberly at Embarcadero is available from 9:45 AM to 7:30 PM. Embarcadero is near the Financial District, which is a key area for some other meetings. This could be a good afternoon meeting, as it's centrally located.\n\nSteven at Financial District is available from 7:15 AM to 9:15 PM. The Financial District is close to Presidio, so this could be an early morning meeting. Steven's availability is extensive, so fitting this in early makes sense.\n\nMark at Marina District is available from 10:15 AM to 1:00 PM. Marina District is a bit further from Presidio, so the traveler might want to plan this for mid-morning to avoid too much travel.\n\nNow, considering all these, I need to create an itinerary that starts at Presidio, visits the closest areas first, and ensures that each meeting fits within the person's availability. The traveler should try to cluster meetings in areas that are geographically close to each other to minimize travel time.\n\nStarting with Chinatown for Jason, then moving to Union Square for Stephanie, followed by Nob Hill for Jessica, Russian Hill for Brian, Haight-Ashbury for Karen, and then North Beach for Kenneth. After that, the traveler can go to Embarcadero for Kimberly and Financial District for Steven, ending the day with Marina District for Mark.\n\nThis approach minimizes backtracking and ensures that each meeting is within the traveler's time constraints. However, I need to double-check the travel distances to ensure that each location is feasible within the given time frames. For example, traveling from Haight-Ashbury to North Beach might take a while, so it's important to schedule that in a way that doesn't cause stress or make the traveler late for subsequent meetings.\n\nOverall, the key is to prioritize meetings that are closer and have more flexible availability early in the day, then move to more distant locations as the day progresses. This should help in maximizing the number of friends the traveler can meet without getting overwhelmed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Nob Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Steven\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Marina District\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
