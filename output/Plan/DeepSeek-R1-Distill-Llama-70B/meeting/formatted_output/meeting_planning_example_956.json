            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to schedule my day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible. I arrive at The Castro at 9:00AM, and I have a bunch of friends spread out across different neighborhoods. Each of them has specific time slots available, and I need to make sure I can meet them without backtracking too much, considering the travel times.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the travel distances provided. The Castro is my starting point, so I should see who is closest or has overlapping time slots that I can utilize efficiently. Let's see, from The Castro, I can go to Alamo Square, which is 8 minutes away, or to Richmond District, which is 16 minutes. Alamo Square seems closer, so maybe I can start there.\n\nLooking at the constraints, William is at Alamo Square from 3:15PM to 5:15PM. That's a good chunk of time, and I need to meet him for at least 60 minutes. So, if I head to Alamo Square right after arriving, I can spend the morning there, but I need to make sure I leave enough time to get back to The Castro for my next meetings.\n\nNext, Joshua is at Richmond District from 7:00AM to 8:00PM. That's a long window, but he only needs 15 minutes. Since Richmond District is a bit further away, I might want to schedule this meeting later in the day when I have more flexibility. Maybe after meeting William.\n\nThen there's Joseph at Financial District from 11:15AM to 1:30PM. Financial District is a bit of a hop from The Castro, about 21 minutes. He only needs 15 minutes, so perhaps I can squeeze this in between other meetings.\n\nDavid is at Union Square from 4:45PM to 7:15PM. Union Square is 19 minutes from The Castro. He needs 45 minutes, which is manageable if I time it right.\n\nBrian is at Fisherman's Wharf from 1:45PM to 8:45PM. Fisherman's Wharf is 24 minutes away. He needs 105 minutes, so that's a longer meeting. Maybe I should plan this for the late afternoon or early evening.\n\nKaren is at Marina District from 11:30AM to 6:30PM. Marina District is 21 minutes away. She needs only 15 minutes, so I can fit her in during my travels.\n\nAnthony is at Haight-Ashbury from 7:15AM to 10:30AM. Haight-Ashbury is 6 minutes away. He needs 30 minutes, which is doable in the morning.\n\nMatthew is at Mission District from 5:15PM to 7:15PM. Mission District is 7 minutes away. He needs 120 minutes, so that's a significant time commitment. I need to ensure I have a clear block of time for this.\n\nHelen is at Pacific Heights from 8:00AM to 12:00PM. Pacific Heights is 16 minutes away. She needs 75 minutes, which is a bit long, but doable if I can manage the travel time.\n\nJeffrey is at Golden Gate Park from 7:00PM to 9:30PM. Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes away. He needs 60 minutes, so that's feasible in the evening.\n\nNow, thinking about the optimal order, I should start with the closest locations and those with the earliest or latest time slots to minimize backtracking. Let's start at The Castro.\n\nFirst, I can meet Anthony at Haight-Ashbury, just 6 minutes away. He's available from 7:15AM to 10:30AM. If I leave The Castro at 7:15AM, I can arrive there just in time.\n\nNext, after meeting Anthony, I can head to Alamo Square to meet William. Alamo Square is 8 minutes from Haight-Ashbury. William is available from 3:15PM to 5:15PM, so I'll need to leave enough time to get back to The Castro for the next meetings.\n\nAfter meeting William, I can go to Richmond District to meet Joshua. It's 16 minutes from Alamo Square, and he's available from 7:00AM to 8:00PM, so I can fit this in later in the day.\n\nThen, I can go to Financial District to meet Joseph. It's 21 minutes from Richmond District, and he's available until 1:30PM, so I need to make sure I leave Richmond District by 1:30PM to catch the travel time.\n\nAfter that, I can head to Union Square to meet David. Union Square is 19 minutes from Financial District, and he's available from 4:45PM to 7:15PM, so I can schedule this for around 5:00PM.\n\nNext, I can go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Brian. It's 24 minutes from Union Square, and he's available until 8:45PM, so I can schedule this for the later part of the afternoon.\n\nThen, I can go to Marina District to meet Karen. It's 21 minutes from Fisherman's Wharf, and she's available until 6:30PM, so I can fit this in before heading to the next meeting.\n\nAfter that, I can go to Mission District to meet Matthew. It's only 7 minutes from Marina District, and he's available until 7:15PM, so I can schedule this for around 6:00PM.\n\nThen, I can head to Pacific Heights to meet Helen. It's 16 minutes from Mission District, and she's available until 12:00PM, but I need to leave enough time to get back to The Castro for the next meetings.\n\nFinally, I can go to Golden Gate Park to meet Jeffrey. It's 11 minutes from Pacific Heights, and he's available until 9:30PM, so I can schedule this for the evening.\n\nI need to make sure that each meeting doesn't overlap and that the travel times are accounted for. Starting with Anthony in the morning, then William, Joshua, Joseph, David, Brian, Karen, Matthew, Helen, and Jeffrey in the evening seems like a logical sequence.\n\nI should also consider the duration of each meeting. For example, meeting Brian for 105 minutes might be better done later in the day to avoid backtracking too much.\n\nOverall, the key is to plan the meetings in a way that minimizes travel time and ensures I can meet each friend for the required duration without being rushed or overlapping meetings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\",\n      \"person\": \"Anthony\",\n      \"start_time\": \"07:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"William\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Richmond District\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Marina District\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"person\": \"Matthew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"22:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"23:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's 21 minutes from Fisherman's Wharf, and she's available until 6:30PM, so I can fit this in before heading to the next meeting.\n\nAfter that, I can go to Mission District to meet Matthew. It's only 7 minutes from Marina District, and he's available until 7:15PM, so I can schedule this for around 6:00PM.\n\nThen, I can head to Pacific Heights to meet Helen. It's 16 minutes from Mission District, and she's available until 12:00PM, but I need to leave enough time to get back to The Castro for the next meetings.\n\nFinally, I can go to Golden Gate Park to meet Jeffrey. It's 11 minutes from Pacific Heights, and he's available until 9:30PM, so I can schedule this for the evening.\n\nI need to make sure that each meeting doesn't overlap and that the travel times are accounted for. Starting with Anthony in the morning, then William, Joshua, Joseph, David, Brian, Karen, Matthew, Helen, and Jeffrey in the evening seems like a logical sequence.\n\nI should also consider the duration of each meeting. For example, meeting Brian for 105 minutes might be better done later in the day to avoid backtracking too much.\n\nOverall, the key is to plan the meetings in a way that minimizes travel time and ensures I can meet each friend for the required duration without being rushed or overlapping meetings.\n</think>\n\n```json"
