            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help plan a meeting schedule for someone visiting San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and the constraints provided. The person arrives at Union Square at 9:00 AM, so that's the starting point. They have to meet several people with specific time windows and locations. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the people, their locations, and the time windows they're available. Then, I'll figure out the best way to schedule the meetings, considering the travel times between locations. The person wants to maximize the number of meetings, so I need to make sure each meeting is feasible within the available time without backtracking too much.\n\nStarting with Kevin in the Mission District. He's available from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM. Since the person arrives at 9:00 AM, the earliest they can meet Kevin is 8:45 PM, but that's a long time away. Maybe that's a late meeting. Let's see if there are others with earlier availability.\n\nMark is at Fisherman's Wharf from 5:15 PM to 8:00 PM. He needs at least 90 minutes. Mark is later in the day, so maybe after some other meetings.\n\nJessica is at Russian Hill from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. That's a long window, especially since she needs 120 minutes. She's available right when the person arrives, so perhaps the first meeting.\n\nJason is at Marina District from 3:15 PM to 9:45 PM. That's a good window, especially since he needs 120 minutes. Meeting him later in the day might be better after other meetings.\n\nJohn is at North Beach from 9:45 AM to 6:00 PM. He needs only 15 minutes, so that's a quick one. Maybe early in the day.\n\nKaren is at Chinatown from 4:45 PM to 7:00 PM. She needs 75 minutes. That's a bit later, but doable.\n\nSarah is at Pacific Heights from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. She needs 45 minutes, so another quick meeting.\n\nAmanda is at The Castro from 8:00 PM to 9:15 PM. She needs 60 minutes. This is quite late, but possible.\n\nNancy is at Nob Hill from 9:45 AM to 1:00 PM. She needs 45 minutes. Maybe a morning meeting.\n\nRebecca is at Sunset District from 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM. She needs 75 minutes. An early meeting could work.\n\nNow, considering the travel times from Union Square to each location:\n\nUnion Square to Mission District: 14 minutes\nUnion Square to Fisherman's Wharf: 15\nRussian Hill: 13\nMarina District: 18\nNorth Beach: 10\nChinatown: 7\nPacific Heights: 15\nThe Castro: 17\nNob Hill: 9\nSunset District: 27\n\nI need to find a sequence that allows the person to move between locations without exceeding the time windows. Starting with someone nearby in the morning seems logical.\n\nNancy is at Nob Hill from 9:45 AM, which is 45 minutes away. If they leave Union Square at 9:15 AM, they can arrive at 9:30 AM, but Nancy isn't available until 9:45. So maybe meet her at 9:45 AM. But that's a 15-minute walk, but wait, the person arrives at 9:00 AM. So they can leave Union Square at 9:15 AM, arriving at Nob Hill at 9:30, but Nancy isn't available until 9:45. So maybe start at 9:45. But the person arrives at 9:00, so they have time to walk around.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet someone else first. Let's see.\n\nJohn is at North Beach, which is 10 minutes away. He's available from 9:45 AM. So perhaps meet John at 9:45 AM.\n\nThen, from North Beach, where can they go next? The travel times from North Beach to other locations:\n\nTo Chinatown: 6 minutes\nTo Pacific Heights: 9\nTo The Castro: 23\nTo Nob Hill: 7\nTo Sunset District: 27\n\nBut after meeting John, they might want to go to another location. Let's see.\n\nIf they meet John at 9:45 AM, then they can leave North Beach at 10:00 AM. Let's say they go to Chinatown, which is 6 minutes away. They arrive at 10:06 AM. But Chinatown's available times are Karen from 4:45 PM to 7:00 PM. So that's too early. Alternatively, they could go to Pacific Heights, which is 9 minutes away, arriving at 10:09 AM. Sarah is there from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. So that's too early as well.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting John, maybe go to The Castro. It's 23 minutes away, arriving at 10:23 AM. But Amanda is there from 8:00 PM to 9:15 PM, which is way later. So that's not feasible.\n\nNob Hill is 7 minutes away, arriving at 10:07 AM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM. So they could meet Nancy at 10:07 AM, but she needs 45 minutes. So the meeting would end at 10:52 AM. Then, they can go somewhere else.\n\nAfter meeting Nancy, they can go to another location. Let's see where.\n\nFrom Nob Hill, they can go to Russian Hill (5 minutes, Jessica is there until 3:00 PM), Fisherman's Wharf (10 minutes, Mark until 8:00 PM), or The Castro (17 minutes, Amanda until 9:15 PM).\n\nIf they go to Fisherman's Wharf, it's 10 minutes, arriving at 10:52 +10 = 11:02 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM, so that's feasible. They can meet Mark for 90 minutes, ending at 12:52 PM. Then, they can go to another location.\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf, options are:\n\nMission District (22 minutes, Kevin until 9:45 PM), Russian Hill (7 minutes, Jessica until 3:00 PM), Marina District (9 minutes, Jason until 9:45 PM), North Beach (6 minutes, but John already met), Chinatown (12, Karen until 7:00 PM), Pacific Heights (12, Sarah until 6:15 PM), The Castro (27, Amanda until 9:15 PM), Nob Hill (11, Nancy until 1:00 PM), Sunset District (27, Rebecca until 3:00 PM).\n\nSo, after meeting Mark, perhaps go to Marina District (9 minutes, arriving at 12:52 +9 = 1:01 PM). Jason is there until 9:45 PM. So they can meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 2:21 PM. Then, go to another location.\n\nFrom Marina District, options:\n\nMission District (19 minutes, Kevin until 9:45 PM), Russian Hill (8, Jessica until 3:00 PM), North Beach (9, John already met), Chinatown (12, Karen until 7:00 PM), Pacific Heights (6, Sarah until 6:15 PM), The Castro (21, Amanda until 9:15 PM), Nob Hill (11, Nancy until 1:00 PM), Sunset District (19, Rebecca until 3:00 PM).\n\nIf they go to Russian Hill, it's 8 minutes, arriving at 2:21 +8 = 2:29 PM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM. So they can meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 4:29 PM. Then, go to Sunset District, which is 23 minutes away, arriving at 4:29 +23 = 4:52 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, so that's too late.\n\nAlternatively, from Marina District, go to Sunset District earlier. Let's see, if they leave Marina District at 2:21 PM, it's 19 minutes to Sunset District, arriving at 2:40 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, so they can meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 3:15 PM. Then, they can go to another location.\n\nFrom Sunset District, options:\n\nUnion Square (30, but already there), Mission District (25, Kevin until 9:45 PM), Fisherman's Wharf (29, Mark until 8:00 PM), Russian Hill (24, Jessica until 3:00 PM), Marina District (21, Jason until 9:45 PM), North Beach (28, John until 6:00 PM), Chinatown (30, Karen until 7:00 PM), Pacific Heights (21, Sarah until 6:15 PM), The Castro (17, Amanda until 9:15 PM), Nob Hill (24, Nancy until 1:00 PM).\n\nSo, from Sunset District, perhaps go to Fisherman's Wharf, 29 minutes, arriving at 3:15 +29 = 3:44 PM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. They can meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 4:34 PM. Then, go to another location.\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf, options:\n\nMission District (22, Kevin until 9:45 PM), Russian Hill (7, Jessica until 3:00 PM), Marina District (9, Jason until 9:45 PM), North Beach (6, John until 6:00 PM), Chinatown (12, Karen until 7:00 PM), Pacific Heights (12, Sarah until 6:15 PM), The Castro (27, Amanda until 9:15 PM), Nob Hill (11, Nancy until 1:00 PM), Sunset District (27, Rebecca until 3:00 PM).\n\nIf they go to Chinatown from Fisherman's Wharf, it's 12 minutes, arriving at 4:34 +12 = 4:46 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. They can meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 5:21 PM. Then, go to Pacific Heights, 12 minutes, arriving at 5:21 +12 = 5:33 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:18 PM.\n\nThen, from Pacific Heights, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:18 +9 = 6:27 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, so that's too late. Alternatively, go to The Castro, 27 minutes, arriving at 6:18 +27 = 6:45 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. They can meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 7:45 PM.\n\nThen, from The Castro, go to Mission District, 7 minutes, arriving at 7:45 +7 = 7:52 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. They can meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 8:52 PM. Then, go to Nob Hill, 13 minutes, arriving at 8:52 +13 = 9:05 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, but it's already 9:05 PM, so that's too late.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Amanda, maybe go to Nob Hill earlier. But time is tight.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting John at North Beach at 9:45 AM, go to Chinatown instead. It's 6 minutes, arriving at 9:51 AM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. They can meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 10:26 AM. Then, go to Pacific Heights, 9 minutes, arriving at 10:26 +9 = 10:35 AM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 11:20 AM. Then, go to Marina District, 18 minutes, arriving at 11:20 +18 = 11:38 AM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 1:38 PM. Then, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:38 +19 = 1:57 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 2:12 PM. Then, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 27 minutes, arriving at 2:12 +27 = 2:39 PM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 3:39 PM. Then, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 3:39 +22 = 4:01 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 5:01 PM. Then, go to The Castro, 17 minutes, arriving at 5:01 +17 = 5:18 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 6:18 PM. Then, go to Nob Hill, 13 minutes, arriving at 6:18 +13 = 6:31 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, so too late. Alternatively, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 6:26 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, so too late.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe another approach: prioritize the longer meetings first, as they take more time, so schedule them earlier.\n\nJessica needs 120 minutes. She's available from 9:00 AM. So maybe start with her.\n\nFrom Union Square, go to Russian Hill, 13 minutes, arriving at 9:13 AM. Meet Jessica for 120 minutes, ending at 10:13 AM. Then, go to North Beach, 10 minutes, arriving at 10:13 +10 = 10:23 AM. John is there until 6:00 PM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:38 AM. Then, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 15 minutes, arriving at 10:38 +15 = 10:53 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 12:53 PM. Then, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 12:53 +22 = 1:15 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 2:15 PM. Then, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 2:15 +19 = 2:34 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:34 PM. Then, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 4:34 +19 = 4:53 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, so too late. Alternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 4:34 +7 = 4:41 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 5:41 PM. Then, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 5:41 +17 = 5:58 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 6:53 PM. Then, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 6:53 +6 = 6:59 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, so too late. Alternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:59 +11 = 7:10 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe after meeting Kevin, go to Nob Hill. Let's try:\n\nStart with Jessica at Russian Hill, 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 10:00 AM. Then, go to North Beach, 10 minutes, arriving at 10:10 AM. John is there until 6:00 PM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:25 AM. Then, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 15 minutes, arriving at 10:40 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 12:40 PM. Then, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 1:02 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 2:02 PM. Then, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 2:21 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:21 PM. Then, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 4:40 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, so too late. Alternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 4:28 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 5:28 PM. Then, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 5:45 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 6:20 PM. Then, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 6:26 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, too late. Alternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:37 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nThis is getting too long. Maybe it's better to focus on the people who need the most time first. Let me try a different approach.\n\nStart with Jessica at Russian Hill, 9:00 AM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 10:00 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 15 minutes, arriving at 10:15 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 12:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 12:37 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 1:37 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:56 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 3:16 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 3:35 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 3:16 +7 = 3:23 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 4:23 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 4:40 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 5:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:21 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:06 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:15 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:06 +11 = 6:17 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nThis is still not working. Maybe try another order.\n\nStart with Kevin in Mission District, but he's only available from 8:45 PM, which is too late. So maybe not.\n\nWhat about meeting John first? He's at North Beach from 9:45 AM. So meet him at 9:45 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 6 minutes, arriving at 9:51 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 10:41 AM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill, 7 minutes, arriving at 10:48 AM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 11:48 AM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 12:10 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 1:10 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:29 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 3:29 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 3:48 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 3:29 +7 = 3:36 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 4:36 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 4:53 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 5:28 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:34 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:19 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:28 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:19 +11 = 6:30 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nThis seems to be a common issue. Maybe the problem is that after meeting Jason, it's hard to find someone else without overlapping times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Jason earlier. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Mark at Fisherman's Wharf, go to Marina District. Let's try:\n\nStart with John at North Beach, 9:45 AM. Then, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 6 minutes, arriving at 9:51 AM. Meet Mark for 90 minutes, ending at 10:41 AM. Then, go to Marina District, 9 minutes, arriving at 10:50 AM. Meet Jason for 120 minutes, ending at 12:50 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:09 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 2:09 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 25 minutes, arriving at 2:34 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 3:34 PM.\n\nThen, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 3:41 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 4:41 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 4:58 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 5:33 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:39 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:24 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:33 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:24 +11 = 6:35 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nThis seems to be the same issue. Maybe it's impossible to meet everyone, so I need to prioritize.\n\nLet me try to include the longer meetings first.\n\nStart with Jessica at Russian Hill, 9:00 AM for 120 minutes until 10:00 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 15 minutes, arriving at 10:15 AM. Meet Mark for 90 minutes until 12:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 12:37 PM. Meet Kevin for 60 minutes until 1:37 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:56 PM. Meet Jason for 120 minutes until 3:16 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 3:35 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 3:16 +7 = 3:23 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes until 4:23 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 4:40 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes until 5:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:21 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes until 6:06 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:15 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:06 +11 = 6:17 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets Jessica, Mark, Kevin, Jason, Amanda, Karen, Sarah. That's 7 people. Is that the maximum possible?\n\nWait, maybe after meeting Jason, instead of going to Sunset District, go to The Castro.\n\nFrom Marina District, after meeting Jason at 3:16 PM, go to The Castro, 21 minutes, arriving at 3:37 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes until 4:37 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 4:49 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes until 5:24 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:30 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes until 6:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:24 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:15 +11 = 6:26 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nStill, the same issue. So, in this plan, the person meets 7 people. Is it possible to meet more?\n\nWait, what about meeting Rebecca? She's at Sunset District until 3:00 PM. If the person can meet her before 3:00 PM.\n\nIn the previous plan, after meeting Jason at 3:16 PM, going to Sunset District at 3:35 PM is too late. But if they go earlier.\n\nWait, from Marina District, going to Sunset District is 19 minutes. If they leave Marina District at 2:56 PM, arriving at Sunset District at 3:15 PM, just before Rebecca leaves at 3:00 PM? No, 3:15 PM is after 3:00 PM. So that's too late.\n\nAlternatively, leave Marina District earlier, but Jason is available until 9:45 PM, so they can leave anytime after 3:16 PM. But going to Sunset District at 3:16 PM, arriving at 3:35 PM, which is after Rebecca's time.\n\nSo, maybe it's impossible to meet Rebecca as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Kevin, go to Sunset District earlier.\n\nWait, after meeting Kevin at 1:37 PM, go to Sunset District, 25 minutes, arriving at 2:02 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 3:07 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 24 minutes, arriving at 3:31 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:31 PM.\n\nThen, go to The Castro, 21 minutes, arriving at 4:52 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 5:52 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:04 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 7:04 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 7:10 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 7:10 +8 = 7:18 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets Jessica, Mark, Kevin, Rebecca, Jason, Amanda, Karen. That's 7 people as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet John first, then go to Fisherman's Wharf, then Russian Hill, etc.\n\nBut in all the plans, the person can't meet more than 7 people. Let me check if that's the maximum.\n\nLet me see the constraints again. The person needs to meet Kevin for at least 60 minutes, Mark for 90, Jessica for 120, Jason for 120, John for 15, Karen for 75, Sarah for 45, Amanda for 60, Nancy for 45, Rebecca for 75.\n\nSo, the person can meet up to 9 people, but given the time constraints and locations, it's impossible to meet everyone. So, the maximum number seems to be 7.\n\nIn the previous plan, they meet Jessica, Mark, Kevin, Jason, Amanda, Karen, Sarah, John. Wait, that's 8. Did I miss someone?\n\nWait, in the first plan, after meeting Jason, the person goes to Sunset District, but Rebecca is already gone. Then, they go to The Castro, Amanda, Chinatown, Karen, Pacific Heights, Sarah, North Beach, John. So, that's 8.\n\nWait, in that plan:\n\n1. Jessica (9:00-10:00)\n2. Mark (10:15-12:15)\n3. Kevin (12:37-1:37)\n4. Jason (1:56-3:16)\n5. Amanda (3:23-4:23)\n6. Karen (4:40-5:15)\n7. Sarah (5:21-6:06)\n8. John (6:15-6:30) but John is only available until 6:00 PM, so that's too late.\n\nSo, actually, they can't meet John after 6:00 PM. So, perhaps they can't meet John as well.\n\nAlternatively, meet John earlier.\n\nLet me try another plan.\n\nStart with John at North Beach, 9:45 AM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:00 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 6 minutes, arriving at 10:06 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 11:06 AM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill, 7 minutes, arriving at 11:13 AM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 12:13 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 12:35 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 1:35 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:54 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 3:14 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 3:33 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 3:14 +7 = 3:21 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 4:21 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 4:38 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 5:13 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:19 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:04 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:13 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:04 +11 = 6:15 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Jason, Amanda, Karen, Sarah. That's 8 people. But wait, John is met at 9:45 AM, which is okay, but after that, the person can't meet John again. So, that's 8.\n\nIs this possible? Let me check the times.\n\n1. Meet John at North Beach, 9:45-10:00 AM.\n2. Fisherman's Wharf, 10:06-11:06 AM.\n3. Russian Hill, 11:13-12:13 PM.\n4. Mission District, 12:35-1:35 PM.\n5. Marina District, 1:54-3:14 PM.\n6. The Castro, 3:21-4:21 PM.\n7. Chinatown, 4:38-5:13 PM.\n8. Pacific Heights, 5:19-6:04 PM.\n\nYes, that seems feasible. But wait, after meeting Pacific Heights, can they go to North Beach again? John is only available until 6:00 PM. So, leaving Pacific Heights at 6:04 PM, it's 9 minutes to North Beach, arriving at 6:13 PM, which is after John's availability. So, they can't meet John again. So, in this plan, they meet John once, and the others. So, total of 8 people.\n\nIs that the maximum? Or can they meet more?\n\nWait, what about Nancy? She's at Nob Hill from 9:45 AM to 1:00 PM. If the person can meet her before going to Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with Nancy at Nob Hill, 9:45 AM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 10:30 AM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 10:38 AM. John is there until 6:00 PM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:53 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 11 minutes, arriving at 10:53 +11 = 11:04 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 12:04 PM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill, 10 minutes, arriving at 12:04 +10 = 12:14 PM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 1:14 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 13 minutes, arriving at 1:27 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 2:27 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 2:46 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:46 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 4:65 PM (which is 5:05 PM). Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 4:46 +7 = 4:53 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 5:53 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 6:10 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 7:10 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 7:16 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 7:16 +11 = 7:27 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets Nancy, John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Jason, Amanda, Karen. That's 8 people as well.\n\nSo, it seems that 8 meetings are possible. Can they meet more?\n\nWhat about Rebecca? She's at Sunset District until 3:00 PM. If the person can meet her before 3:00 PM.\n\nIn the previous plan, after meeting Jason at 4:46 PM, going to Sunset District at 4:46 +19 = 5:05 PM, which is after Rebecca's time. So, no.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Kevin at 2:27 PM, go to Sunset District earlier.\n\nFrom Mission District, go to Sunset District, 25 minutes, arriving at 2:27 +25 = 2:52 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 3:27 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 24 minutes, arriving at 3:51 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:51 PM.\n\nThen, go to The Castro, 21 minutes, arriving at 5:12 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 5:12 +60 = 6:12 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:24 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 7:24 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 7:30 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 7:30 +8 = 7:38 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets Nancy, John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Rebecca, Jason, Amanda, Karen. That's 9 people. Wait, that's more.\n\nBut wait, let's check the times:\n\n1. Nancy at Nob Hill, 9:45-10:30 AM.\n2. John at North Beach, 10:38-10:53 AM.\n3. Mark at Fisherman's Wharf, 11:04-12:04 PM.\n4. Jessica at Russian Hill, 12:14-1:14 PM.\n5. Kevin at Mission District, 1:27-2:27 PM.\n6. Rebecca at Sunset District, 2:52-3:27 PM.\n7. Jason at Marina District, 4:51-5:51 PM.\n8. Amanda at The Castro, 5:51-6:51 PM.\n9. Karen at Chinatown, 7:24-8:24 PM.\n\nWait, that's 9 people. But after meeting Karen at 7:24 PM, they can go to Pacific Heights, but Sarah is already gone. Alternatively, go to North Beach, but John is gone. Alternatively, go to Nob Hill, Nancy is gone. So, total of 9.\n\nBut wait, in this plan, the person meets:\n\n- Nancy (10:30)\n- John (10:53)\n- Mark (12:04)\n- Jessica (1:14)\n- Kevin (2:27)\n- Rebecca (3:27)\n- Jason (5:51)\n- Amanda (6:51)\n- Karen (8:24)\n\nThat's 9 people. But the person arrives at 9:00 AM, so they can't meet anyone before that. So, starting with Nancy at 9:45 AM seems okay.\n\nBut let's check the travel times between meetings:\n\nFrom Nob Hill to North Beach: 8 minutes, arriving at 9:45 +8 = 9:53 AM. But John is available from 9:45 AM, so they can meet him at 9:45 AM.\n\nWait, that's better. So, in this case, the person can meet Nancy at 9:45 AM, then go to North Beach to meet John at 9:45 AM. But that's overlapping. They can't be in two places at once.\n\nSo, perhaps meet Nancy first, then go to North Beach.\n\nWait, starting at Union Square at 9:00 AM, they can go to Nob Hill, 9 minutes, arriving at 9:09 AM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 9:54 AM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 9:54 +8 = 10:02 AM. John is there until 6:00 PM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:17 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 11 minutes, arriving at 10:17 +11 = 10:28 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 11:28 AM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill, 10 minutes, arriving at 11:28 +10 = 11:38 AM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 12:38 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 13 minutes, arriving at 12:38 +13 = 12:51 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 1:51 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 25 minutes, arriving at 1:51 +25 = 2:16 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 2:16 +75 = 3:16 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 24 minutes, arriving at 3:16 +24 = 3:40 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:40 PM.\n\nThen, go to The Castro, 21 minutes, arriving at 4:40 +21 = 5:01 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 6:01 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:01 +12 = 6:13 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 7:13 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 7:13 +6 = 7:19 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 7:19 +8 = 7:27 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets Nancy, John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Rebecca, Jason, Amanda, Karen. That's 9 people.\n\nBut wait, after meeting Karen at 7:13 PM, they can't go to Pacific Heights, but they can go to Nob Hill, which is 11 minutes away, arriving at 7:13 +11 = 7:24 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, so too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, but Amanda is already met. So, this seems to be the maximum.\n\nBut wait, in this plan, the person meets 9 people, but let's check if all the meeting times are within the required windows.\n\n- Nancy: 9:45-9:54 AM (correct)\n- John: 10:02-10:17 AM (correct)\n- Mark: 10:28-11:28 AM (correct)\n- Jessica: 11:38-12:38 PM (correct)\n- Kevin: 12:51-1:51 PM (correct)\n- Rebecca: 2:16-3:16 PM (correct)\n- Jason: 3:40-4:40 PM (correct)\n- Amanda: 5:01-6:01 PM (correct)\n- Karen: 6:13-7:13 PM (correct)\n\nYes, all within the required times. So, 9 people.\n\nIs it possible to meet more? Let's see.\n\nWhat about meeting Sarah? She's at Pacific Heights from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. If the person can meet her.\n\nAfter meeting Amanda at 6:01 PM, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 6:07 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:12 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:21 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:19 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. But Karen is already met.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets 10 people? Wait, no, because Sarah is an additional person.\n\nWait, in the previous plan, after meeting Karen at 7:13 PM, they can go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 7:19 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, so too late. Alternatively, go to North Beach, but John is gone.\n\nSo, in this case, they can't meet Sarah. So, the maximum is 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the schedule to meet Sarah.\n\nAfter meeting Amanda at 6:01 PM, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 6:07 PM. Meet Sarah for 45 minutes, ending at 6:12 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:21 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:19 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her again, but she needs at least 75 minutes. But she's already been met, so it's not necessary.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets 9 people: Nancy, John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Rebecca, Jason, Amanda, Karen, Sarah? Wait, that's 10.\n\nWait, no, because after meeting Amanda at 6:01 PM, they go to Pacific Heights at 6:07 PM, meet Sarah for 45 minutes until 6:12 PM, then go to North Beach, arriving at 6:21 PM, which is too late for John.\n\nSo, in this case, the person meets 10 people. But wait, is that possible?\n\nWait, the person can meet:\n\n1. Nancy (9:45-9:54)\n2. John (10:02-10:17)\n3. Mark (10:28-11:28)\n4. Jessica (11:38-12:38)\n5. Kevin (12:51-1:51)\n6. Rebecca (2:16-3:16)\n7. Jason (3:40-4:40)\n8. Amanda (5:01-6:01)\n9. Karen (6:13-7:13)\n10. Sarah (6:07-6:12)\n\nBut wait, the person can't be in two places at once. After meeting Amanda at 6:01 PM, they go to Pacific Heights at 6:07 PM, meet Sarah until 6:12 PM, then go to North Beach, which takes 9 minutes, arriving at 6:21 PM. But John is only available until 6:00 PM, so that's too late.\n\nSo, in reality, they can only meet Sarah if they adjust the schedule to meet her earlier.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Amanda at 5:01 PM, go to Pacific Heights earlier.\n\nFrom The Castro, go to Pacific Heights, 16 minutes, arriving at 5:01 +16 = 5:17 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 5:17 +45 = 6:02 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:02 +9 = 6:11 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:02 +12 = 6:14 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her again, but she's already met.\n\nSo, in this case, the person can meet Sarah, but can't meet John.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets 10 people, but John is missed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet John earlier.\n\nAfter meeting Kevin at 1:51 PM, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 1:59 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 2:14 PM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 11 minutes, arriving at 2:25 PM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 3:25 PM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill, 10 minutes, arriving at 3:35 PM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Mission District, 13 minutes, arriving at 2:14 +13 = 2:27 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him again, but he's already met.\n\nSo, this seems tricky.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum number of people the person can meet is 9, as in the previous plan, meeting Nancy, John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Rebecca, Jason, Amanda, Karen. Or 10 if they include Sarah but miss John.\n\nBut the problem is, the person wants to meet as many friends as possible. So, if they can meet 10, that's better, but they have to sacrifice meeting John.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different order allows meeting 10 without missing John.\n\nBut it's getting too complicated. Maybe 9 is the maximum.\n\nWait, in the initial plan, the person meets 8 people, but by adjusting, they can meet 9 or 10.\n\nI think the best plan is to meet as many as possible, so 10 people, but I'm not sure if it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal is 8 people, with a more balanced schedule.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I think 9 is possible.\n\nSo, the plan would be:\n\n1. Meet Nancy at Nob Hill, 9:45-10:30 AM.\n2. Meet John at North Beach, 10:38-10:53 AM.\n3. Meet Mark at Fisherman's Wharf, 11:04-12:04 PM.\n4. Meet Jessica at Russian Hill, 12:14-1:14 PM.\n5. Meet Kevin at Mission District, 1:27-2:27 PM.\n6. Meet Rebecca at Sunset District, 2:52-3:27 PM.\n7. Meet Jason at Marina District, 4:51-5:51 PM.\n8. Meet Amanda at The Castro, 5:51-6:51 PM.\n9. Meet Karen at Chinatown, 7:24-8:24 PM.\n\nThis way, the person meets 9 friends without missing anyone, but they can't meet Sarah. Alternatively, if they meet Sarah instead of someone else, but that reduces the total number.\n\nSo, the best plan is 9 meetings.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Nob Hill\", \"person\": \"Nancy\", \"start_time\": \"9:45\", \"end_time\": \"10:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"John\", \"start_time\": \"10:38\", \"end_time\": \"10:53\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"Mark\", \"start_time\": \"11:04\", \"end_time\": \"12:04\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Russian Hill\", \"person\": \"Jessica\", \"start_time\": \"12:14\", \"end_time\": \"1:14\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Mission District\", \"person\": \"Kevin\", \"start_time\": \"1:27\", \"end_time\": \"2:27\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Sunset District\", \"person\": \"Rebecca\", \"start_time\": \"2:52\", \"end_time\": \"3:27\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"Jason\", \"start_time\": \"4:51\", \"end_time\": \"5:51\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"The Castro\", \"person\": \"Amanda\", \"start_time\": \"5:51\", \"end_time\": \"6:51\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"7:24\", \"end_time\": \"8:24\"}\n  ]\n}",
            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to help plan a meeting schedule for someone visiting San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and the constraints provided. The person arrives at Union Square at 9:00 AM, so that's the starting point. They have to meet several people with specific time windows and locations. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the people, their locations, and the time windows they're available. Then, I'll figure out the best way to schedule the meetings, considering the travel times between locations. The person wants to maximize the number of meetings, so I need to make sure each meeting is feasible within the available time without backtracking too much.\n\nStarting with Kevin in the Mission District. He's available from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM. Since the person arrives at 9:00 AM, the earliest they can meet Kevin is 8:45 PM, but that's a long time away. Maybe that's a late meeting. Let's see if there are others with earlier availability.\n\nMark is at Fisherman's Wharf from 5:15 PM to 8:00 PM. He needs at least 90 minutes. Mark is later in the day, so maybe after some other meetings.\n\nJessica is at Russian Hill from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. That's a long window, especially since she needs 120 minutes. She's available right when the person arrives, so perhaps the first meeting.\n\nJason is at Marina District from 3:15 PM to 9:45 PM. That's a good window, especially since he needs 120 minutes. Meeting him later in the day might be better after other meetings.\n\nJohn is at North Beach from 9:45 AM to 6:00 PM. He needs only 15 minutes, so that's a quick one. Maybe early in the day.\n\nKaren is at Chinatown from 4:45 PM to 7:00 PM. She needs 75 minutes. That's a bit later, but doable.\n\nSarah is at Pacific Heights from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. She needs 45 minutes, so another quick meeting.\n\nAmanda is at The Castro from 8:00 PM to 9:15 PM. She needs 60 minutes. This is quite late, but possible.\n\nNancy is at Nob Hill from 9:45 AM to 1:00 PM. She needs 45 minutes. Maybe a morning meeting.\n\nRebecca is at Sunset District from 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM. She needs 75 minutes. An early meeting could work.\n\nNow, considering the travel times from Union Square to each location:\n\nUnion Square to Mission District: 14 minutes\nUnion Square to Fisherman's Wharf: 15\nRussian Hill: 13\nMarina District: 18\nNorth Beach: 10\nChinatown: 7\nPacific Heights: 15\nThe Castro: 17\nNob Hill: 9\nSunset District: 27\n\nI need to find a sequence that allows the person to move between locations without exceeding the time windows. Starting with someone nearby in the morning seems logical.\n\nNancy is at Nob Hill from 9:45 AM, which is 45 minutes away. If they leave Union Square at 9:15 AM, they can arrive at 9:30 AM, but Nancy isn't available until 9:45. So maybe meet her at 9:45 AM. But that's a 15-minute walk, but wait, the person arrives at 9:00 AM. So they can leave Union Square at 9:15 AM, arriving at Nob Hill at 9:30, but Nancy isn't available until 9:45. So maybe start at 9:45. But the person arrives at 9:00, so they have time to walk around.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet someone else first. Let's see.\n\nJohn is at North Beach, which is 10 minutes away. He's available from 9:45 AM. So perhaps meet John at 9:45 AM.\n\nThen, from North Beach, where can they go next? The travel times from North Beach to other locations:\n\nTo Chinatown: 6 minutes\nTo Pacific Heights: 9\nTo The Castro: 23\nTo Nob Hill: 7\nTo Sunset District: 27\n\nBut after meeting John, they might want to go to another location. Let's see.\n\nIf they meet John at 9:45 AM, then they can leave North Beach at 10:00 AM. Let's say they go to Chinatown, which is 6 minutes away. They arrive at 10:06 AM. But Chinatown's available times are Karen from 4:45 PM to 7:00 PM. So that's too early. Alternatively, they could go to Pacific Heights, which is 9 minutes away, arriving at 10:09 AM. Sarah is there from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. So that's too early as well.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting John, maybe go to The Castro. It's 23 minutes away, arriving at 10:23 AM. But Amanda is there from 8:00 PM to 9:15 PM, which is way later. So that's not feasible.\n\nNob Hill is 7 minutes away, arriving at 10:07 AM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM. So they could meet Nancy at 10:07 AM, but she needs 45 minutes. So the meeting would end at 10:52 AM. Then, they can go somewhere else.\n\nAfter meeting Nancy, they can go to another location. Let's see where.\n\nFrom Nob Hill, they can go to Russian Hill (5 minutes, Jessica is there until 3:00 PM), Fisherman's Wharf (10 minutes, Mark until 8:00 PM), or The Castro (17 minutes, Amanda until 9:15 PM).\n\nIf they go to Fisherman's Wharf, it's 10 minutes, arriving at 10:52 +10 = 11:02 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM, so that's feasible. They can meet Mark for 90 minutes, ending at 12:52 PM. Then, they can go to another location.\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf, options are:\n\nMission District (22 minutes, Kevin until 9:45 PM), Russian Hill (7 minutes, Jessica until 3:00 PM), Marina District (9 minutes, Jason until 9:45 PM), North Beach (6 minutes, but John already met), Chinatown (12, Karen until 7:00 PM), Pacific Heights (12, Sarah until 6:15 PM), The Castro (27, Amanda until 9:15 PM), Nob Hill (11, Nancy until 1:00 PM), Sunset District (27, Rebecca until 3:00 PM).\n\nSo, after meeting Mark, perhaps go to Marina District (9 minutes, arriving at 12:52 +9 = 1:01 PM). Jason is there until 9:45 PM. So they can meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 2:21 PM. Then, go to another location.\n\nFrom Marina District, options:\n\nMission District (19 minutes, Kevin until 9:45 PM), Russian Hill (8, Jessica until 3:00 PM), North Beach (9, John already met), Chinatown (12, Karen until 7:00 PM), Pacific Heights (6, Sarah until 6:15 PM), The Castro (21, Amanda until 9:15 PM), Nob Hill (11, Nancy until 1:00 PM), Sunset District (19, Rebecca until 3:00 PM).\n\nIf they go to Russian Hill, it's 8 minutes, arriving at 2:21 +8 = 2:29 PM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM. So they can meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 4:29 PM. Then, go to Sunset District, which is 23 minutes away, arriving at 4:29 +23 = 4:52 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, so that's too late.\n\nAlternatively, from Marina District, go to Sunset District earlier. Let's see, if they leave Marina District at 2:21 PM, it's 19 minutes to Sunset District, arriving at 2:40 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, so they can meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 3:15 PM. Then, they can go to another location.\n\nFrom Sunset District, options:\n\nUnion Square (30, but already there), Mission District (25, Kevin until 9:45 PM), Fisherman's Wharf (29, Mark until 8:00 PM), Russian Hill (24, Jessica until 3:00 PM), Marina District (21, Jason until 9:45 PM), North Beach (28, John until 6:00 PM), Chinatown (30, Karen until 7:00 PM), Pacific Heights (21, Sarah until 6:15 PM), The Castro (17, Amanda until 9:15 PM), Nob Hill (24, Nancy until 1:00 PM).\n\nSo, from Sunset District, perhaps go to Fisherman's Wharf, 29 minutes, arriving at 3:15 +29 = 3:44 PM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. They can meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 4:34 PM. Then, go to another location.\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf, options:\n\nMission District (22, Kevin until 9:45 PM), Russian Hill (7, Jessica until 3:00 PM), Marina District (9, Jason until 9:45 PM), North Beach (6, John until 6:00 PM), Chinatown (12, Karen until 7:00 PM), Pacific Heights (12, Sarah until 6:15 PM), The Castro (27, Amanda until 9:15 PM), Nob Hill (11, Nancy until 1:00 PM), Sunset District (27, Rebecca until 3:00 PM).\n\nIf they go to Chinatown from Fisherman's Wharf, it's 12 minutes, arriving at 4:34 +12 = 4:46 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. They can meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 5:21 PM. Then, go to Pacific Heights, 12 minutes, arriving at 5:21 +12 = 5:33 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:18 PM.\n\nThen, from Pacific Heights, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:18 +9 = 6:27 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, so that's too late. Alternatively, go to The Castro, 27 minutes, arriving at 6:18 +27 = 6:45 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. They can meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 7:45 PM.\n\nThen, from The Castro, go to Mission District, 7 minutes, arriving at 7:45 +7 = 7:52 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. They can meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 8:52 PM. Then, go to Nob Hill, 13 minutes, arriving at 8:52 +13 = 9:05 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, but it's already 9:05 PM, so that's too late.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Amanda, maybe go to Nob Hill earlier. But time is tight.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting John at North Beach at 9:45 AM, go to Chinatown instead. It's 6 minutes, arriving at 9:51 AM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. They can meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 10:26 AM. Then, go to Pacific Heights, 9 minutes, arriving at 10:26 +9 = 10:35 AM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 11:20 AM. Then, go to Marina District, 18 minutes, arriving at 11:20 +18 = 11:38 AM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 1:38 PM. Then, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:38 +19 = 1:57 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 2:12 PM. Then, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 27 minutes, arriving at 2:12 +27 = 2:39 PM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 3:39 PM. Then, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 3:39 +22 = 4:01 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 5:01 PM. Then, go to The Castro, 17 minutes, arriving at 5:01 +17 = 5:18 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 6:18 PM. Then, go to Nob Hill, 13 minutes, arriving at 6:18 +13 = 6:31 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, so too late. Alternatively, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 6:26 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, so too late.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe another approach: prioritize the longer meetings first, as they take more time, so schedule them earlier.\n\nJessica needs 120 minutes. She's available from 9:00 AM. So maybe start with her.\n\nFrom Union Square, go to Russian Hill, 13 minutes, arriving at 9:13 AM. Meet Jessica for 120 minutes, ending at 10:13 AM. Then, go to North Beach, 10 minutes, arriving at 10:13 +10 = 10:23 AM. John is there until 6:00 PM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:38 AM. Then, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 15 minutes, arriving at 10:38 +15 = 10:53 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 12:53 PM. Then, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 12:53 +22 = 1:15 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 2:15 PM. Then, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 2:15 +19 = 2:34 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:34 PM. Then, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 4:34 +19 = 4:53 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, so too late. Alternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 4:34 +7 = 4:41 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 5:41 PM. Then, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 5:41 +17 = 5:58 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 6:53 PM. Then, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 6:53 +6 = 6:59 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, so too late. Alternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:59 +11 = 7:10 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe after meeting Kevin, go to Nob Hill. Let's try:\n\nStart with Jessica at Russian Hill, 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 10:00 AM. Then, go to North Beach, 10 minutes, arriving at 10:10 AM. John is there until 6:00 PM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:25 AM. Then, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 15 minutes, arriving at 10:40 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 12:40 PM. Then, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 1:02 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 2:02 PM. Then, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 2:21 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:21 PM. Then, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 4:40 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, so too late. Alternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 4:28 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 5:28 PM. Then, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 5:45 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 6:20 PM. Then, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 6:26 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, too late. Alternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:37 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nThis is getting too long. Maybe it's better to focus on the people who need the most time first. Let me try a different approach.\n\nStart with Jessica at Russian Hill, 9:00 AM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 10:00 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 15 minutes, arriving at 10:15 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 12:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 12:37 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 1:37 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:56 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 3:16 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 3:35 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 3:16 +7 = 3:23 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 4:23 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 4:40 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 5:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:21 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:06 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:15 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:06 +11 = 6:17 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nThis is still not working. Maybe try another order.\n\nStart with Kevin in Mission District, but he's only available from 8:45 PM, which is too late. So maybe not.\n\nWhat about meeting John first? He's at North Beach from 9:45 AM. So meet him at 9:45 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 6 minutes, arriving at 9:51 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 10:41 AM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill, 7 minutes, arriving at 10:48 AM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 11:48 AM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 12:10 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 1:10 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:29 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 3:29 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 3:48 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 3:29 +7 = 3:36 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 4:36 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 4:53 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 5:28 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:34 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:19 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:28 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:19 +11 = 6:30 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nThis seems to be a common issue. Maybe the problem is that after meeting Jason, it's hard to find someone else without overlapping times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Jason earlier. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Mark at Fisherman's Wharf, go to Marina District. Let's try:\n\nStart with John at North Beach, 9:45 AM. Then, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 6 minutes, arriving at 9:51 AM. Meet Mark for 90 minutes, ending at 10:41 AM. Then, go to Marina District, 9 minutes, arriving at 10:50 AM. Meet Jason for 120 minutes, ending at 12:50 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:09 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 2:09 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 25 minutes, arriving at 2:34 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 3:34 PM.\n\nThen, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 3:41 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 4:41 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 4:58 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 5:33 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:39 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:24 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:33 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:24 +11 = 6:35 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nThis seems to be the same issue. Maybe it's impossible to meet everyone, so I need to prioritize.\n\nLet me try to include the longer meetings first.\n\nStart with Jessica at Russian Hill, 9:00 AM for 120 minutes until 10:00 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 15 minutes, arriving at 10:15 AM. Meet Mark for 90 minutes until 12:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 12:37 PM. Meet Kevin for 60 minutes until 1:37 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:56 PM. Meet Jason for 120 minutes until 3:16 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 3:35 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 3:16 +7 = 3:23 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes until 4:23 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 4:40 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes until 5:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:21 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes until 6:06 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:15 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:06 +11 = 6:17 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets Jessica, Mark, Kevin, Jason, Amanda, Karen, Sarah. That's 7 people. Is that the maximum possible?\n\nWait, maybe after meeting Jason, instead of going to Sunset District, go to The Castro.\n\nFrom Marina District, after meeting Jason at 3:16 PM, go to The Castro, 21 minutes, arriving at 3:37 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes until 4:37 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 4:49 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes until 5:24 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:30 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes until 6:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:24 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:15 +11 = 6:26 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nStill, the same issue. So, in this plan, the person meets 7 people. Is it possible to meet more?\n\nWait, what about meeting Rebecca? She's at Sunset District until 3:00 PM. If the person can meet her before 3:00 PM.\n\nIn the previous plan, after meeting Jason at 3:16 PM, going to Sunset District at 3:35 PM is too late. But if they go earlier.\n\nWait, from Marina District, going to Sunset District is 19 minutes. If they leave Marina District at 2:56 PM, arriving at Sunset District at 3:15 PM, just before Rebecca leaves at 3:00 PM? No, 3:15 PM is after 3:00 PM. So that's too late.\n\nAlternatively, leave Marina District earlier, but Jason is available until 9:45 PM, so they can leave anytime after 3:16 PM. But going to Sunset District at 3:16 PM, arriving at 3:35 PM, which is after Rebecca's time.\n\nSo, maybe it's impossible to meet Rebecca as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Kevin, go to Sunset District earlier.\n\nWait, after meeting Kevin at 1:37 PM, go to Sunset District, 25 minutes, arriving at 2:02 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 3:07 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 24 minutes, arriving at 3:31 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:31 PM.\n\nThen, go to The Castro, 21 minutes, arriving at 4:52 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 5:52 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:04 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 7:04 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 7:10 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 7:10 +8 = 7:18 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets Jessica, Mark, Kevin, Rebecca, Jason, Amanda, Karen. That's 7 people as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet John first, then go to Fisherman's Wharf, then Russian Hill, etc.\n\nBut in all the plans, the person can't meet more than 7 people. Let me check if that's the maximum.\n\nLet me see the constraints again. The person needs to meet Kevin for at least 60 minutes, Mark for 90, Jessica for 120, Jason for 120, John for 15, Karen for 75, Sarah for 45, Amanda for 60, Nancy for 45, Rebecca for 75.\n\nSo, the person can meet up to 9 people, but given the time constraints and locations, it's impossible to meet everyone. So, the maximum number seems to be 7.\n\nIn the previous plan, they meet Jessica, Mark, Kevin, Jason, Amanda, Karen, Sarah, John. Wait, that's 8. Did I miss someone?\n\nWait, in the first plan, after meeting Jason, the person goes to Sunset District, but Rebecca is already gone. Then, they go to The Castro, Amanda, Chinatown, Karen, Pacific Heights, Sarah, North Beach, John. So, that's 8.\n\nWait, in that plan:\n\n1. Jessica (9:00-10:00)\n2. Mark (10:15-12:15)\n3. Kevin (12:37-1:37)\n4. Jason (1:56-3:16)\n5. Amanda (3:23-4:23)\n6. Karen (4:40-5:15)\n7. Sarah (5:21-6:06)\n8. John (6:15-6:30) but John is only available until 6:00 PM, so that's too late.\n\nSo, actually, they can't meet John after 6:00 PM. So, perhaps they can't meet John as well.\n\nAlternatively, meet John earlier.\n\nLet me try another plan.\n\nStart with John at North Beach, 9:45 AM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:00 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 6 minutes, arriving at 10:06 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 11:06 AM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill, 7 minutes, arriving at 11:13 AM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 12:13 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 22 minutes, arriving at 12:35 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 1:35 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 1:54 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 3:14 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 3:33 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 3:14 +7 = 3:21 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 4:21 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 4:38 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 5:13 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 5:19 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:04 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:13 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 6:04 +11 = 6:15 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Jason, Amanda, Karen, Sarah. That's 8 people. But wait, John is met at 9:45 AM, which is okay, but after that, the person can't meet John again. So, that's 8.\n\nIs this possible? Let me check the times.\n\n1. Meet John at North Beach, 9:45-10:00 AM.\n2. Fisherman's Wharf, 10:06-11:06 AM.\n3. Russian Hill, 11:13-12:13 PM.\n4. Mission District, 12:35-1:35 PM.\n5. Marina District, 1:54-3:14 PM.\n6. The Castro, 3:21-4:21 PM.\n7. Chinatown, 4:38-5:13 PM.\n8. Pacific Heights, 5:19-6:04 PM.\n\nYes, that seems feasible. But wait, after meeting Pacific Heights, can they go to North Beach again? John is only available until 6:00 PM. So, leaving Pacific Heights at 6:04 PM, it's 9 minutes to North Beach, arriving at 6:13 PM, which is after John's availability. So, they can't meet John again. So, in this plan, they meet John once, and the others. So, total of 8 people.\n\nIs that the maximum? Or can they meet more?\n\nWait, what about Nancy? She's at Nob Hill from 9:45 AM to 1:00 PM. If the person can meet her before going to Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with Nancy at Nob Hill, 9:45 AM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 10:30 AM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 10:38 AM. John is there until 6:00 PM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:53 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 11 minutes, arriving at 10:53 +11 = 11:04 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 12:04 PM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill, 10 minutes, arriving at 12:04 +10 = 12:14 PM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 1:14 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 13 minutes, arriving at 1:27 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 2:27 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 19 minutes, arriving at 2:46 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:46 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 19 minutes, arriving at 4:65 PM (which is 5:05 PM). Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, 7 minutes, arriving at 4:46 +7 = 4:53 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 5:53 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 17 minutes, arriving at 6:10 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 7:10 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 7:16 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Nob Hill, 11 minutes, arriving at 7:16 +11 = 7:27 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets Nancy, John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Jason, Amanda, Karen. That's 8 people as well.\n\nSo, it seems that 8 meetings are possible. Can they meet more?\n\nWhat about Rebecca? She's at Sunset District until 3:00 PM. If the person can meet her before 3:00 PM.\n\nIn the previous plan, after meeting Jason at 4:46 PM, going to Sunset District at 4:46 +19 = 5:05 PM, which is after Rebecca's time. So, no.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Kevin at 2:27 PM, go to Sunset District earlier.\n\nFrom Mission District, go to Sunset District, 25 minutes, arriving at 2:27 +25 = 2:52 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 3:27 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 24 minutes, arriving at 3:51 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:51 PM.\n\nThen, go to The Castro, 21 minutes, arriving at 5:12 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 5:12 +60 = 6:12 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:24 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 7:24 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 7:30 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 7:30 +8 = 7:38 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets Nancy, John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Rebecca, Jason, Amanda, Karen. That's 9 people. Wait, that's more.\n\nBut wait, let's check the times:\n\n1. Nancy at Nob Hill, 9:45-10:30 AM.\n2. John at North Beach, 10:38-10:53 AM.\n3. Mark at Fisherman's Wharf, 11:04-12:04 PM.\n4. Jessica at Russian Hill, 12:14-1:14 PM.\n5. Kevin at Mission District, 1:27-2:27 PM.\n6. Rebecca at Sunset District, 2:52-3:27 PM.\n7. Jason at Marina District, 4:51-5:51 PM.\n8. Amanda at The Castro, 5:51-6:51 PM.\n9. Karen at Chinatown, 7:24-8:24 PM.\n\nWait, that's 9 people. But after meeting Karen at 7:24 PM, they can go to Pacific Heights, but Sarah is already gone. Alternatively, go to North Beach, but John is gone. Alternatively, go to Nob Hill, Nancy is gone. So, total of 9.\n\nBut wait, in this plan, the person meets:\n\n- Nancy (10:30)\n- John (10:53)\n- Mark (12:04)\n- Jessica (1:14)\n- Kevin (2:27)\n- Rebecca (3:27)\n- Jason (5:51)\n- Amanda (6:51)\n- Karen (8:24)\n\nThat's 9 people. But the person arrives at 9:00 AM, so they can't meet anyone before that. So, starting with Nancy at 9:45 AM seems okay.\n\nBut let's check the travel times between meetings:\n\nFrom Nob Hill to North Beach: 8 minutes, arriving at 9:45 +8 = 9:53 AM. But John is available from 9:45 AM, so they can meet him at 9:45 AM.\n\nWait, that's better. So, in this case, the person can meet Nancy at 9:45 AM, then go to North Beach to meet John at 9:45 AM. But that's overlapping. They can't be in two places at once.\n\nSo, perhaps meet Nancy first, then go to North Beach.\n\nWait, starting at Union Square at 9:00 AM, they can go to Nob Hill, 9 minutes, arriving at 9:09 AM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 9:54 AM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 9:54 +8 = 10:02 AM. John is there until 6:00 PM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 10:17 AM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 11 minutes, arriving at 10:17 +11 = 10:28 AM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 11:28 AM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill, 10 minutes, arriving at 11:28 +10 = 11:38 AM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 120 minutes, ending at 12:38 PM.\n\nThen, go to Mission District, 13 minutes, arriving at 12:38 +13 = 12:51 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 60 minutes, ending at 1:51 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District, 25 minutes, arriving at 1:51 +25 = 2:16 PM. Rebecca is there until 3:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 2:16 +75 = 3:16 PM.\n\nThen, go to Marina District, 24 minutes, arriving at 3:16 +24 = 3:40 PM. Jason is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him for 120 minutes, ending at 4:40 PM.\n\nThen, go to The Castro, 21 minutes, arriving at 4:40 +21 = 5:01 PM. Amanda is there until 9:15 PM. Meet her for 60 minutes, ending at 6:01 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:01 +12 = 6:13 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her for 75 minutes, ending at 7:13 PM.\n\nThen, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 7:13 +6 = 7:19 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 7:19 +8 = 7:27 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets Nancy, John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Rebecca, Jason, Amanda, Karen. That's 9 people.\n\nBut wait, after meeting Karen at 7:13 PM, they can't go to Pacific Heights, but they can go to Nob Hill, which is 11 minutes away, arriving at 7:13 +11 = 7:24 PM. Nancy is there until 1:00 PM, so too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to The Castro, but Amanda is already met. So, this seems to be the maximum.\n\nBut wait, in this plan, the person meets 9 people, but let's check if all the meeting times are within the required windows.\n\n- Nancy: 9:45-9:54 AM (correct)\n- John: 10:02-10:17 AM (correct)\n- Mark: 10:28-11:28 AM (correct)\n- Jessica: 11:38-12:38 PM (correct)\n- Kevin: 12:51-1:51 PM (correct)\n- Rebecca: 2:16-3:16 PM (correct)\n- Jason: 3:40-4:40 PM (correct)\n- Amanda: 5:01-6:01 PM (correct)\n- Karen: 6:13-7:13 PM (correct)\n\nYes, all within the required times. So, 9 people.\n\nIs it possible to meet more? Let's see.\n\nWhat about meeting Sarah? She's at Pacific Heights from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. If the person can meet her.\n\nAfter meeting Amanda at 6:01 PM, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 6:07 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 6:12 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:21 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:19 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. But Karen is already met.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets 10 people? Wait, no, because Sarah is an additional person.\n\nWait, in the previous plan, after meeting Karen at 7:13 PM, they can go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 7:19 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM, so too late. Alternatively, go to North Beach, but John is gone.\n\nSo, in this case, they can't meet Sarah. So, the maximum is 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the schedule to meet Sarah.\n\nAfter meeting Amanda at 6:01 PM, go to Pacific Heights, 6 minutes, arriving at 6:07 PM. Meet Sarah for 45 minutes, ending at 6:12 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:21 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:19 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her again, but she needs at least 75 minutes. But she's already been met, so it's not necessary.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets 9 people: Nancy, John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Rebecca, Jason, Amanda, Karen, Sarah? Wait, that's 10.\n\nWait, no, because after meeting Amanda at 6:01 PM, they go to Pacific Heights at 6:07 PM, meet Sarah for 45 minutes until 6:12 PM, then go to North Beach, arriving at 6:21 PM, which is too late for John.\n\nSo, in this case, the person meets 10 people. But wait, is that possible?\n\nWait, the person can meet:\n\n1. Nancy (9:45-9:54)\n2. John (10:02-10:17)\n3. Mark (10:28-11:28)\n4. Jessica (11:38-12:38)\n5. Kevin (12:51-1:51)\n6. Rebecca (2:16-3:16)\n7. Jason (3:40-4:40)\n8. Amanda (5:01-6:01)\n9. Karen (6:13-7:13)\n10. Sarah (6:07-6:12)\n\nBut wait, the person can't be in two places at once. After meeting Amanda at 6:01 PM, they go to Pacific Heights at 6:07 PM, meet Sarah until 6:12 PM, then go to North Beach, which takes 9 minutes, arriving at 6:21 PM. But John is only available until 6:00 PM, so that's too late.\n\nSo, in reality, they can only meet Sarah if they adjust the schedule to meet her earlier.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Amanda at 5:01 PM, go to Pacific Heights earlier.\n\nFrom The Castro, go to Pacific Heights, 16 minutes, arriving at 5:01 +16 = 5:17 PM. Sarah is there until 6:15 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes, ending at 5:17 +45 = 6:02 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach, 9 minutes, arriving at 6:02 +9 = 6:11 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Chinatown, 12 minutes, arriving at 6:02 +12 = 6:14 PM. Karen is there until 7:00 PM. Meet her again, but she's already met.\n\nSo, in this case, the person can meet Sarah, but can't meet John.\n\nSo, in this plan, the person meets 10 people, but John is missed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet John earlier.\n\nAfter meeting Kevin at 1:51 PM, go to North Beach, 8 minutes, arriving at 1:59 PM. John is there until 6:00 PM. Meet him for 15 minutes, ending at 2:14 PM.\n\nThen, go to Fisherman's Wharf, 11 minutes, arriving at 2:25 PM. Mark is there until 8:00 PM. Meet him for 90 minutes, ending at 3:25 PM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill, 10 minutes, arriving at 3:35 PM. Jessica is there until 3:00 PM, too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Mission District, 13 minutes, arriving at 2:14 +13 = 2:27 PM. Kevin is there until 9:45 PM. Meet him again, but he's already met.\n\nSo, this seems tricky.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum number of people the person can meet is 9, as in the previous plan, meeting Nancy, John, Mark, Jessica, Kevin, Rebecca, Jason, Amanda, Karen. Or 10 if they include Sarah but miss John.\n\nBut the problem is, the person wants to meet as many friends as possible. So, if they can meet 10, that's better, but they have to sacrifice meeting John.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different order allows meeting 10 without missing John.\n\nBut it's getting too complicated. Maybe 9 is the maximum.\n\nWait, in the initial plan, the person meets 8 people, but by adjusting, they can meet 9 or 10.\n\nI think the best plan is to meet as many as possible, so 10 people, but I'm not sure if it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal is 8 people, with a more balanced schedule.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I think 9 is possible.\n\nSo, the plan would be:\n\n1. Meet Nancy at Nob Hill, 9:45-10:30 AM.\n2. Meet John at North Beach, 10:38-10:53 AM.\n3. Meet Mark at Fisherman's Wharf, 11:04-12:04 PM.\n4. Meet Jessica at Russian Hill, 12:14-1:14 PM.\n5. Meet Kevin at Mission District, 1:27-2:27 PM.\n6. Meet Rebecca at Sunset District, 2:52-3:27 PM.\n7. Meet Jason at Marina District, 4:51-5:51 PM.\n8. Meet Amanda at The Castro, 5:51-6:51 PM.\n9. Meet Karen at Chinatown, 7:24-8:24 PM.\n\nThis way, the person meets 9 friends without missing anyone, but they can't meet Sarah. Alternatively, if they meet Sarah instead of someone else, but that reduces the total number.\n\nSo, the best plan is 9 meetings.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:"
