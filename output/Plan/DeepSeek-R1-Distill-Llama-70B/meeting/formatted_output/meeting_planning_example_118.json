            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, I'm an AI meeting planner visiting San Francisco for the day and I want to meet as many friends as possible. I've been given specific travel distances between various locations and constraints on when each person is available. My goal is to create an itinerary that maximizes the number of meetings while respecting the travel times and the availability windows.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the constraints. I arrive at Bayview at 9:00 AM. Richard is available at Union Square from 8:45 AM to 1:00 PM, and I need to meet him for at least 120 minutes. Charles is at Presidio from 9:45 AM to 1:00 PM, and I need to meet him for at least 120 minutes as well.\n\nSo, my initial thought is to meet both Richard and Charles because they have overlapping availability windows. However, I need to ensure that the travel times between Bayview and their respective locations are manageable and that the meeting durations fit within their available times.\n\nLet's consider the travel times:\n\n- From Bayview to Union Square: 17 minutes.\n- From Bayview to Presidio: 31 minutes.\n- From Union Square to Bayview: 15 minutes.\n- From Union Square to Presidio: 24 minutes.\n- From Presidio to Bayview: 31 minutes.\n- From Presidio to Union Square: 22 minutes.\n\nI need to meet Richard at Union Square and Charles at Presidio. Given that both have availability until 1:00 PM, I should plan the meetings to fit within their time frames.\n\nIf I meet Richard first at Union Square, I would need to leave Bayview by 8:45 AM + 120 minutes = 10:45 AM to arrive by 10:45 AM. The travel time from Bayview to Union Square is 17 minutes, so I would arrive at 10:17 AM. However, Richard is available until 1:00 PM, so I can adjust the meeting time to fit my schedule better.\n\nSimilarly, for Charles at Presidio, I would need to leave Bayview by 9:45 AM + 120 minutes = 11:45 AM. The travel time to Presidio is 31 minutes, so I would arrive at 12:16 PM. Charles is available until 1:00 PM, so this seems feasible.\n\nBut wait, I can't meet both Richard and Charles in the same time frame because their meeting times would overlap. I need to decide which one to meet first and then see if I can fit the other in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can meet one of them in the morning and the other in the afternoon, but given their availability, they are both available until 1:00 PM. So, perhaps it's better to meet the one whose location is closer to Bayview first to save time.\n\nUnion Square is closer to Bayview, only 17 minutes away, while Presidio is 31 minutes away. So, meeting Richard first at Union Square might be more efficient.\n\nLet's outline a possible schedule:\n\n1. Meet Richard at Union Square.\n   - Depart Bayview at 10:00 AM.\n   - Arrive at Union Square at 10:17 AM.\n   - Meet for 120 minutes until 11:37 AM.\n   - Then, travel back to Bayview, taking 17 minutes, arriving at 11:54 AM.\n\n2. Then, meet Charles at Presidio.\n   - Depart Bayview at 12:00 PM.\n   - Arrive at Presidio at 12:31 PM.\n   - Meet for 120 minutes until 1:51 PM.\n   - But Charles is only available until 1:00 PM, so this won't work.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, meeting Richard first would require me to be at Presidio by 1:00 PM, but my meeting with Charles would spill over beyond his availability.\n\nMaybe I should meet Charles first at Presidio:\n\n1. Meet Charles at Presidio.\n   - Depart Bayview at 10:00 AM.\n   - Arrive at Presidio at 10:31 AM.\n   - Meet for 120 minutes until 11:51 AM.\n   - Travel back to Bayview, arriving at 12:16 PM.\n\n2. Then, meet Richard at Union Square.\n   - Depart Bayview at 12:30 PM.\n   - Arrive at Union Square at 12:47 PM.\n   - Meet for 120 minutes until 1:47 PM.\n   - But Richard is only available until 1:00 PM, so this also doesn't work.\n\nThis suggests that meeting both Richard and Charles for 120 minutes each is not possible because their availability windows don't align well with the travel times from Bayview.\n\nPerhaps I need to prioritize one meeting over the other. Given that both are important, I might need to make a choice based on the travel distances and the time savings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to adjust the meeting times to fit within their availability windows.\n\nWait, perhaps I can meet Richard for a shorter duration in the morning and then meet Charles in the afternoon.\n\nBut the constraint specifies a minimum of 120 minutes, so I can't reduce the meeting time below that.\n\nAnother approach could be to see if I can overlap the meetings in some way, but given the travel times, it might not be feasible.\n\nGiven the constraints, it seems that meeting both Richard and Charles for the required minimum time isn't possible with the given travel distances and their availability windows. Therefore, I might need to choose one to meet and possibly miss the other.\n\nIf I choose to meet Richard, I can plan the meeting at Union Square in the morning, and if possible, see if I can fit in a shorter meeting with Charles in the afternoon, but that might not meet the minimum time requirement.\n\nAlternatively, if I meet Charles first in the morning and then try to meet Richard in the afternoon, but again, the timing might not work out.\n\nGiven the complexity, it might be best to meet the one whose location is closer and whose availability window allows for a longer meeting without conflicting with the other person's time.\n\nAfter considering all these factors, I think the best plan is to meet Richard at Union Square first, as it's closer, and then see if I can meet Charles at Presidio in the afternoon, even if it means adjusting the meeting time slightly.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Depart Bayview at 10:00 AM.\n2. Arrive at Union Square at 10:17 AM.\n3. Meet Richard from 10:17 AM to 11:37 AM.\n4. Return to Bayview, arriving at 11:54 AM.\n5. Depart Bayview at 12:00 PM.\n6. Arrive at Presidio at 12:31 PM.\n7. Meet Charles from 12:31 PM to 1:51 PM, but since Charles is only available until 1:00 PM, I'll need to adjust the meeting to end at 1:00 PM, which is 51 minutes instead of 120. This doesn't meet the minimum requirement.\n\nTherefore, this approach doesn't work. It seems that meeting both Richard and Charles for the required time isn't feasible with the given constraints.\n\nPerhaps I need to reevaluate the initial assumption. Maybe there's a way to optimize the schedule better. Let's try another approach.\n\nWhat if I meet Richard at Union Square in the morning and then, after returning to Bayview, meet Charles at Presidio in the afternoon, but ensure that the total travel time and meeting durations fit within the day.\n\nBut considering the travel times and meeting durations, it's not possible to meet both for 120 minutes each within the day without overlapping or exceeding their availability.\n\nGiven this, I might have to prioritize one meeting over the other. Since both are important, I'll choose to meet the one whose location allows for a more efficient schedule.\n\nIn this case, meeting Richard at Union Square in the morning seems more efficient due to the shorter travel time, and then perhaps meeting Charles in the afternoon if time permits, even if it's for a shorter duration.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies a minimum meeting time, so I can't reduce the meeting time with Charles. Therefore, it's not possible to meet both as per the constraints.\n\nGiven all this, the best possible itinerary would be to meet one of them, either Richard or Charles, and possibly inform the other that due to time constraints, it's not feasible to meet both on the same day.\n\nBut the problem states that I want to meet as many friends as possible, so I need to find a way to meet both if possible.\n\nWait, maybe I can adjust the meeting times to fit within their availability windows.\n\nLet's recalculate:\n\nIf I meet Richard at Union Square:\n\n- Depart Bayview at 10:00 AM.\n- Arrive at Union Square at 10:17 AM.\n- Meet from 10:17 AM to 11:37 AM (120 minutes).\n- Return to Bayview at 11:54 AM.\n\nThen, meet Charles at Presidio:\n\n- Depart Bayview at 12:00 PM.\n- Arrive at Presidio at 12:31 PM.\n- Need to meet for 120 minutes until 1:51 PM, but Charles is only available until 1:00 PM.\n- So, I can meet Charles from 12:31 PM to 1:00 PM (29 minutes), which is less than the required 120 minutes.\n\nThis doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if I leave Bayview later:\n\n- Depart Bayview at 11:00 AM.\n- Arrive at Presidio at 11:31 AM.\n- Meet Charles from 11:31 AM to 1:51 PM (120 minutes), but Charles is only available until 1:00 PM.\n- So, I can only meet him until 1:00 PM, which is 29 minutes.\n\nStill, this doesn't meet the requirement.\n\nPerhaps I need to accept that it's not possible to meet both Richard and Charles for the required time on the same day with the given travel distances and their availability windows.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to meet one of them, either Richard or Charles, and inform the other that it's not feasible to meet both on this day.\n\nBut the problem states that I want to meet as many friends as possible, so ideally, I should meet both if possible.\n\nGiven the constraints, it's not possible, so I'll proceed to meet the one whose meeting can be scheduled without conflicts.\n\nAfter considering all the factors, I'll choose to meet Richard at Union Square in the morning and then see if I can adjust my schedule to meet Charles in the afternoon, even if it means a shorter meeting time, but since the minimum is 120 minutes, this isn't an option.\n\nTherefore, the final decision is to meet Richard at Union Square first, and then, if possible, meet Charles at Presidio in the afternoon, but this might not meet the minimum time requirement.\n\nGiven this, I'll proceed with meeting Richard first and note that Charles cannot be met on this day due to time constraints.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:20\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
