            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help this user plan their meetings in San Francisco. They've provided a bunch of travel times between different districts and some constraints about when each person is available. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings they can attend without being late or causing others to wait too long.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the user's starting point and time. They arrive at the Financial District at 9:00 AM. That's their starting location. Now, they want to meet as many friends as possible, so I should try to schedule meetings in a way that allows for the most efficient use of time, considering travel times between locations.\n\nLooking at the constraints, each friend has specific time windows when they're available. For example, Ronald is available from 1:45 PM to 5:15 PM, which is a pretty long window. Patricia is available from 9:15 AM to 10:00 PM, which is almost the entire day. Laura is only available for a short 15-minute window at 12:30 PM to 12:45 PM. Emily is available from 4:15 PM to 6:30 PM, and Mary is available from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n\nSince the user starts at 9:00 AM in the Financial District, the first thing to consider is whether they can meet Laura, who is only available at 12:30 PM. If they leave Financial District at 9:30 AM, it would take 15 minutes to reach North Beach, arriving at 9:45 AM. But Laura is only available from 12:30 PM, so maybe they can wait at North Beach until then. However, that might be a bit of a long wait, but it's possible.\n\nNext, after meeting Laura, they need to figure out where to go next. Laura is at North Beach, so from there, they can go to The Castro, Golden Gate Park, or back to Financial District. But considering the next available time is 4:15 PM for Emily, they have some time to move around.\n\nIf they go to The Castro after Laura, that's a 20-minute walk from North Beach. The Castro is where Emily will be from 4:15 PM to 6:30 PM. So if they arrive a bit before 4:15 PM, they can wait there. Alternatively, they could go to Golden Gate Park, which is 22 minutes from North Beach. Mary is at Golden Gate Park from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM. So if they leave North Beach around 2:30 PM, they can make it to Golden Gate Park in time for Mary's meeting.\n\nBut wait, after meeting Laura at 12:45 PM, they have a few options. Maybe going to Golden Gate Park first for Mary's meeting would be better because it's closer and they can get there faster. Then, after meeting Mary, they can go to The Castro to meet Emily. That way, they can cover two meetings before Emily's window closes at 6:30 PM.\n\nThen, after Emily, they can head to Russian Hill to meet Ronald. The travel time from The Castro to Russian Hill is 18 minutes. Ronald is available until 5:15 PM, so if they leave The Castro by 4:45 PM, they can make it to Russian Hill in time. They'll have a good chunk of time with Ronald, which is 105 minutes, so they can start at 4:45 PM and end at 5:15 PM, which fits within his availability.\n\nFinally, Patricia is available from 9:15 AM to 10:00 PM, so after meeting Ronald, they can go back to Financial District if needed, but since Patricia is already at Sunset District, they can go there directly. The travel time from Russian Hill to Sunset District is 23 minutes. If they leave Russian Hill at 5:15 PM, they'll arrive at Sunset District at 5:38 PM, which is within Patricia's available time. They can have a 60-minute meeting, ending at 6:38 PM.\n\nWait, but they have to consider the travel times and ensure they don't miss any meetings. Maybe there's a better sequence that allows them to meet more people without rushing. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, they could meet Ronald first thing after arriving, but his availability starts at 1:45 PM, so they can't meet him until then. So they have to wait until 1:45 PM to start their meeting with Ronald, which would take up most of the afternoon.\n\nBut if they meet Ronald first, that might leave the rest of the day for other meetings. However, Patricia is available all day, so maybe meeting her last would be better. But they have to fit in Laura and Emily as well.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to meet Laura first, then Mary, then Emily, then Ronald, and finally Patricia. That way, they cover all the necessary meetings without overlapping too much.\n\nBut I need to check the travel times between these locations to ensure it's feasible. Let me outline the possible schedule:\n\n1. Start at Financial District at 9:00 AM.\n2. Go to North Beach to meet Laura at 12:30 PM.\n3. After Laura, go to Golden Gate Park to meet Mary at 3:00 PM.\n4. Then, go to The Castro to meet Emily at 4:15 PM.\n5. After Emily, go to Russian Hill to meet Ronald starting at 4:45 PM.\n6. Finally, go to Sunset District to meet Patricia, arriving by 5:38 PM.\n\nThis seems to fit within the available time windows for each meeting. The user would have to manage their time carefully, ensuring they don't miss any meetings by leaving enough travel time between each location.\n\nI think this plan allows them to meet all five friends without missing any windows. It might be tight, but with careful scheduling, it should work.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Laura\", \"start_time\": \"12:30\", \"end_time\": \"12:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"15:00\", \"end_time\": \"16:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"The Castro\", \"person\": \"Emily\", \"start_time\": \"16:15\", \"end_time\": \"17:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Russian Hill\", \"person\": \"Ronald\", \"start_time\": \"17:45\", \"end_time\": \"19:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Sunset District\", \"person\": \"Patricia\", \"start_time\": \"18:38\", \"end_time\": \"19:38\"}\n  ]\n}",
