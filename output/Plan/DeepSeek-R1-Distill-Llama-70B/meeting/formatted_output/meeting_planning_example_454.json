I'm an AI meeting planner, and my goal is to meet as many friends as possible in a single day. I need to consider travel distances and constraints carefully to optimize the schedule.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the travel distances provided. The distances between various locations like Presidio, Golden Gate Park, Bayview, Chinatown, North Beach, and Mission District are given. I need to make sure I can get from one place to another without taking too much time, so I can maximize the number of meetings.\n\nNow, looking at the constraints, I arrive at Presidio at 9:00 AM. I need to meet several people at different locations throughout the day. Let's list out the people I need to meet and their preferred meeting times and locations:\n\n1. **Jessica**: Golden Gate Park from 1:45 PM to 3:00 PM. I need at least 30 minutes with her.\n2. **Ashley**: Bayview from 5:15 PM to 8:00 PM. I need 105 minutes.\n3. **Ronald**: Chinatown from 7:15 AM to 2:45 PM. I need 90 minutes.\n4. **William**: North Beach from 1:15 PM to 8:15 PM. I need 15 minutes.\n5. **Daniel**: Mission District from 7:00 AM to 11:15 AM. I need 105 minutes.\n\nI need to plan my day in a way that allows me to visit all these locations without backtracking too much, considering the travel distances. Also, I have to make sure that each meeting is at least the required duration.\n\nStarting with **Ronald** in Chinatown at 7:15 AM. Chinatown is close to Presidio, so that's a short trip. I can meet him for 90 minutes, which should be enough.\n\nNext, **Daniel** in the Mission District. He's available from 7:00 AM to 11:15 AM. Since I'm already in Chinatown, I can go to Mission District after meeting Ronald. The travel distance from Chinatown to Mission District is 16 minutes, which is manageable. I need to meet him for 105 minutes, so I should plan to spend the morning there.\n\nAfter meeting Daniel, I can head to **William** in North Beach. He's available from 1:15 PM to 8:15 PM. I need only 15 minutes with him, so I can schedule that in the afternoon. The travel from Mission District to North Beach is 17 minutes.\n\nThen, **Jessica** at Golden Gate Park. She's available from 1:45 PM to 3:00 PM. I need 30 minutes with her. Golden Gate Park is 17 minutes from North Beach, so I can go there after meeting William.\n\nAfter meeting Jessica, I have some free time until 5:15 PM. I can use this time to travel to **Ashley** in Bayview. The travel distance from Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 23 minutes. I need 105 minutes with her, so I can spend the rest of the afternoon and into the evening there.\n\nFinally, I'll wrap up my day by returning to Presidio if needed, but since all meetings are covered, I can end the day after meeting Ashley.\n\nI need to make sure that the travel times between each location are feasible and that I'm not backtracking too much. Also, I should check if any meetings overlap or if I can adjust the order to minimize travel time.\n\nLet me outline the schedule:\n\n1. **Chinatown** - 7:15 AM to 8:05 AM (90 minutes with Ronald).\n2. **Mission District** - 8:05 AM to 11:10 AM (105 minutes with Daniel).\n3. **North Beach** - 12:10 PM to 12:25 PM (15 minutes with William).\n4. **Golden Gate Park** - 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM (30 minutes with Jessica).\n5. **Bayview** - 2:30 PM to 5:35 PM (105 minutes with Ashley).\n\nThis seems to fit within the constraints and allows me to meet all the required friends without excessive travel time. I should double-check the travel distances to ensure everything is accurate and that I can move smoothly between locations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Ronald\",\n      \"start_time\": \"07:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"08:05\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"person\": \"Daniel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"08:05\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:10\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"William\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:10\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:25\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"person\": \"Ashley\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:35\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
