            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help plan this meeting schedule for someone visiting San Francisco. They want to meet as many friends as possible, but they have a lot of constraints based on their arrival time and others' availability. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user arrives at Richmond District at 9:00 AM. That's the starting point. They need to meet several people, each with their own time windows and locations. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping too much, considering the travel times between locations.\n\nLooking at the constraints, there are a few key people to meet: Kimberly at Marina District from 1:15 PM to 4:45 PM, Robert at Chinatown from 12:15 PM to 8:15 PM, Rebecca at Financial District from 1:15 PM to 4:45 PM, Margaret at Bayview from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM, and Kenneth at Union Square from 7:30 PM to 9:15 PM.\n\nI need to figure out the best order to visit these locations to minimize travel time and maximize the number of meetings. Starting with someone closer might be better. Margaret is at Bayview from 9:30 AM, which is 15 minutes away from Richmond District. That seems like a good first stop.\n\nAfter meeting Margaret, the next closest location is Chinatown, which is 20 minutes from Richmond District. Robert is available from 12:15 PM, so if we leave after meeting Margaret, maybe around 10:15 AM, we can get to Chinatown by 10:35 AM. That leaves some time before Robert's 12:15 PM window, but maybe we can do something else in between.\n\nWait, but after meeting Margaret, maybe it's better to go to another location closer to Richmond. Marina District is 9 minutes away, but Kimberly isn't available until 1:15 PM. So maybe after Margaret, go to Marina District a bit later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Margaret, go to Chinatown, then to Marina District, then to Financial District, etc. But I need to make sure the timings work out so that each meeting is possible without missing the windows.\n\nAlso, considering the return times, Kenneth is at Union Square from 7:30 PM to 9:15 PM, which is a longer window, so maybe that can be the last meeting.\n\nI also need to consider that Rebecca is at Financial District from 1:15 PM to 4:45 PM, which is a good chunk of time. Meeting her might require a longer block, so planning that in a way that doesn't conflict with other meetings is important.\n\nI think the optimal schedule would be to start at Richmond District, go to Bayview to meet Margaret, then to Chinatown for Robert, then to Marina District for Kimberly, then to Financial District for Rebecca, and finally to Union Square for Kenneth. This way, each meeting is within the available windows, and the travel times are manageable.\n\nI should check the travel times between each location to make sure the transitions are feasible. From Bayview to Chinatown is 18 minutes, which is doable. From Chinatown to Marina District is 12 minutes. From Marina District to Financial District is 15 minutes. From Financial District to Union Square is 9 minutes. That seems manageable.\n\nAlso, making sure that each meeting is at least the required minimum time. For example, meeting Rebecca for 75 minutes, so the meeting should be from 2:00 PM to 3:15 PM, but she's available until 4:45 PM, so that's fine.\n\nFinally, making sure that the last meeting ends before Kenneth's 7:30 PM start time, so maybe Union Square meeting can be from 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM, but Kenneth is available until 9:15 PM, so that's okay.\n\nI think this plan works. It allows meeting all five friends without overlapping their availability windows and with reasonable travel times in between.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Bayview\", \"person\": \"Margaret\", \"start_time\": \"09:15\", \"end_time\": \"09:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"12:15\", \"end_time\": \"12:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"Kimberly\", \"start_time\": \"13:15\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"person\": \"Rebecca\", \"start_time\": \"14:15\", \"end_time\": \"15:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Union Square\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"19:00\", \"end_time\": \"20:15\"}\n  ]\n}",
