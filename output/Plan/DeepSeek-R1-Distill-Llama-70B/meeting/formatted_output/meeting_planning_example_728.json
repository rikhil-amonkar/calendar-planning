They arrive at Marina District at 9:00 AM and want to meet as many friends as possible. Let me go through the constraints and the travel distances to figure out the best schedule.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the people and their available times:\n\n1. Karen at Mission District from 2:15 PM to 10:00 PM. Needs 30 minutes.\n2. Richard at Fisherman's Wharf from 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM. Needs 30 minutes.\n3. Robert at Presidio from 9:45 PM to 10:45 PM. Needs 60 minutes.\n4. Joseph at Union Square from 11:45 AM to 2:45 PM. Needs 120 minutes.\n5. Helen at Sunset District from 2:45 PM to 8:45 PM. Needs 105 minutes.\n6. Elizabeth at Financial District from 10:00 AM to 12:45 PM. Needs 75 minutes.\n7. Kimberly at Haight-Ashbury from 2:15 PM to 5:30 PM. Needs 105 minutes.\n8. Ashley at Russian Hill from 11:30 AM to 9:30 PM. Needs 45 minutes.\n\nI need to make sure each meeting is at least the required duration and that travel times are considered. Starting at Marina District at 9:00 AM, I should look for the earliest possible meetings.\n\nLooking at Elizabeth, she's available from 10:00 AM to 12:45 PM in Financial District. The travel time from Marina to Financial is 15 minutes. That's a good early meeting.\n\nNext, Ashley is at Russian Hill from 11:30 AM. The travel time from Marina to Russian Hill is 8 minutes. That's quick, so maybe after meeting Elizabeth.\n\nAfter Ashley, perhaps Kimberly at Haight-Ashbury from 2:15 PM. The travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. That works.\n\nThen, Karen at Mission District from 2:15 PM. Travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Mission is 12 minutes. That's close, but do I have time? Let's see.\n\nWait, Kimberly ends at 5:30 PM, Karen starts at 2:15 PM. Maybe do Karen first. But Kimberly is at Haight-Ashbury from 2:15, so maybe meet Kimberly first.\n\nWait, let me think about the timeline.\n\nAfter Ashley, go to Haight-Ashbury for Kimberly from 2:15 PM to 5:30 PM. Then from there to Mission District for Karen, arriving around 3:15 PM, meeting until 4:15 PM. Then from Mission District to Fisherman's Wharf for Richard, leaving at 4:15 PM, arriving by 4:45 PM, meeting until 5:15 PM. Then to Sunset District for Helen, leaving at 5:15 PM, arriving by 6:15 PM, meeting until 7:15 PM. Then to Presidio for Robert, leaving at 7:15 PM, arriving by 7:45 PM, meeting until 8:45 PM. Then to Union Square for Joseph, but Joseph is available until 2:45 PM, which is too early. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe adjust the order. Let's try:\n\n1. Elizabeth at Financial District from 10:00 AM to 12:45 PM.\n2. Ashley at Russian Hill from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM.\n3. Then, from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury for Kimberly from 2:15 PM to 5:30 PM.\n4. From Haight-Ashbury to Mission District for Karen from 2:15 PM to 4:15 PM.\n5. From Mission District to Fisherman's Wharf for Richard from 4:15 PM to 5:30 PM.\n6. From Fisherman's Wharf to Sunset District for Helen from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM.\n7. From Sunset District to Presidio for Robert from 7:30 PM to 8:30 PM.\n8. From Presidio to Union Square for Joseph, but Joseph is only available until 2:45 PM, which is too early.\n\nWait, Joseph's availability is from 11:45 AM to 2:45 PM, so if I can make it to Union Square before 2:45 PM, that would work. Let me check the travel times.\n\nAfter meeting Robert at Presidio from 7:30 PM to 8:30 PM, I can go to Union Square, which is 24 minutes from Presidio. But that would be after Joseph's availability. So maybe need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps, after meeting Helen at Sunset District from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM, go to Union Square to meet Joseph from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM, but Joseph is only available until 2:45 PM. That doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Joseph earlier. Let me see if I can fit Joseph in between meetings.\n\nIf I meet Joseph at Union Square from 11:45 AM to 2:45 PM, I can go there after meeting Elizabeth and Ashley.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Elizabeth at Financial District from 10:00 AM to 12:45 PM.\n2. Ashley at Russian Hill from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM.\n3. Then, go to Union Square to meet Joseph from 12:45 PM to 2:45 PM.\n4.

Then to Presidio for Robert from 7:45 PM to 8:45 PM.\n\nThis way, all meetings are scheduled without overlapping and within the required times. I need to make sure the travel times are accounted for and that each meeting starts and ends correctly.\n\nWait, from Presidio to Sunset District is 15 minutes, but after meeting Robert at Presidio from 7:45 PM to 8:45 PM, I can go to Sunset District, but Helen is available until 8:45 PM, so that's perfect.\n\nLet me check the times:\n\n- Elizabeth: 10:00 AM - 12:45 PM\n- Ashley: 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM\n- Joseph: 12:45 PM - 2:45 PM\n- Kimberly: 2:15 PM - 5:30 PM\n- Karen: 4:15 PM - 5:15 PM\n- Richard: 5:15 PM - 6:15 PM\n- Helen: 6:15 PM - 7:45 PM\n- Robert: 7:45 PM - 8:45 PM\n\nThis seems to fit.
