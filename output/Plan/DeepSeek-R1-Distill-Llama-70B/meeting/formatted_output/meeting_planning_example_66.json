I've got this list of places and the distances between them, but I'm a bit overwhelmed by all the options. Let me start by understanding the constraints and what each person is available for.\n\nFirst, I arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. That's my starting point. Now, I need to meet Robert, who's at the Presidio from 11:15 AM to 5:45 PM. He wants to meet for at least 120 minutes. So, I need to find a time when both of us are available and can spend that much time together.\n\nI also notice that the travel time between Nob Hill and Presidio is 17 minutes, and from Presidio back to Nob Hill is 18 minutes. That's pretty quick, which is good because it means I can go back and forth without spending too much time traveling.\n\nLet me think about the best time to meet Robert. He's available from 11:15 AM to 5:45 PM. Since I need at least 120 minutes with him, I should find a slot where I can be present for that duration without conflicting with other meetings.\n\nWait, but the problem only mentions Robert as a constraint. Do I have other friends to meet? The previous examples had multiple friends, but in this case, it's just Robert. So, I just need to make sure I meet him for 120 minutes within his available time.\n\nHmm, but I should also consider the travel time. If I leave Nob Hill at 11:15 AM, it would take me 17 minutes to reach Presidio. That means I'd arrive at 11:32 AM. Then, I need to stay until at least 1:32 PM to meet the 120-minute requirement. But Robert is available until 5:45 PM, so I can adjust the meeting time accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, if I leave later, say at 12:00 PM, I'd arrive at Presidio at 12:17 PM. Then, I need to stay until 2:17 PM. That gives me more flexibility because Robert is available until 5:45 PM.\n\nWait, but I don't have other meetings, so maybe I can just pick a time that works for both of us. Let me calculate the best time. If I leave Nob Hill at 11:15 AM, I arrive at Presidio at 11:32 AM. If I start the meeting then, I can end at 1:32 PM, which is within Robert's availability. That seems good.\n\nBut I should also check if there's a better time. If I leave later, say at 12:00 PM, I arrive at 12:17 PM and can end at 2:17 PM. That's also fine. But starting earlier might leave more time open for other potential meetings, although in this case, there are none.\n\nI think starting at 11:15 AM is a good balance because it allows me to meet Robert for the required 120 minutes without rush. Plus, the travel time is short, so it's efficient.\n\nSo, my plan is to meet Robert at the Presidio starting at 11:15 AM, spend the next two hours with him, and then head back to Nob Hill after the meeting. That should satisfy all the constraints and allow me to meet him for the minimum required time.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Presidio\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
