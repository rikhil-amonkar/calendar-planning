            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to schedule my meetings in San Francisco. I arrive at Sunset District at 9:00 AM, and I need to meet as many friends as possible. I have a few constraints with specific people and times, so I need to make sure I meet them without overlapping or missing any deadlines.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the travel distances provided. Sunset District to Russian Hill is 24 minutes, Sunset District to Chinatown is 30 minutes, Sunset District to Presidio is 16 minutes, Sunset District to Fisherman's Wharf is 29 minutes, and so on. These distances will help me plan the logistics of my day.\n\nThe main goal is to maximize the number of meetings. So, I need to plan my day efficiently, considering the travel times to ensure I can move from one location to another without being late or too rushed.\n\nStarting with William, who will be at Russian Hill from 6:30 PM to 8:45 PM. I need to meet him for at least 105 minutes. So, I should plan to be there around 6:30 PM and stay until 8:45 PM. But I also need to make sure I can get from Sunset District to Russian Hill in time. The travel distance from Sunset District to Russian Hill is 24 minutes, which seems manageable.\n\nNext, Michelle will be at Chinatown from 8:15 AM to 2:00 PM. I need to meet her for at least 15 minutes. Chinatown is 30 minutes away from Sunset District, so I can go early in the morning before her schedule starts. Maybe around 8:15 AM when she arrives, but I need to confirm her exact start time.\n\nThen, George will be at Presidio from 10:30 AM to 6:45 PM. Meeting him for 30 minutes. Presidio is 16 minutes away from Sunset District. I can go after meeting Michelle, perhaps around 10:30 AM when he arrives. That way, I can have a quick meeting and then move on to other locations.\n\nLastly, Robert will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:00 AM to 1:45 PM. I need to meet him for 30 minutes. Fisherman's Wharf is 29 minutes away from Sunset District. Since he's starting at 9:00 AM, I can meet him early in the morning before heading to other meetings.\n\nSo, my tentative schedule would be:\n\n1. Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM to meet Robert for 30 minutes.\n2. Presidio at 10:30 AM to meet George for 30 minutes.\n3. Chinatown at 8:15 AM to meet Michelle for 15 minutes.\n4. Russian Hill at 6:30 PM to meet William for 105 minutes.\n\nBut I need to check if these times overlap or if there's a better way to schedule them without missing any meetings. Also, I need to ensure that the travel times are reasonable and that I have enough time to move between locations.\n\nWait, I realize that I have a conflict. If I meet Robert at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM, then I need to go to Presidio at 10:30 AM, which is 29 minutes away. That seems feasible. Then, after meeting George, I can go to Chinatown, which is 30 minutes from Presidio. But if I leave Presidio at 11:00 AM, I can arrive at Chinatown around 11:30 AM, but Michelle is there from 8:15 AM to 2:00 PM. Maybe I can meet her in the morning before her schedule gets too busy.\n\nHowever, if I meet Michelle at 8:15 AM, I can travel from Sunset District to Chinatown in 30 minutes, which would work. Then, I can go to Fisherman's Wharf after that. But I also need to meet Robert at 9:00 AM, so I might need to adjust the timing.\n\nPerhaps I can meet Robert first at 9:00 AM, then travel to Presidio for George, and then go to Chinatown in the morning. But I need to make sure I have enough time to move between these locations without being late.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe I can start with Chinatown early in the morning, then go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Robert, and then to Presidio to meet George. That way, I can cover all three meetings without too much travel.\n\nBut I need to check the travel distances again:\n\n- Sunset District to Chinatown: 30 minutes\n- Chinatown to Fisherman's Wharf: 8 minutes\n- Fisherman's Wharf to Presidio: 17 minutes\n\nSo, starting at Sunset District at 9:00 AM, traveling to Chinatown (30 minutes), then to Fisherman's Wharf (8 minutes), then to Presidio (17 minutes). That seems doable.\n\nThen, after meeting George, I can go to Russian Hill to meet William at 6:30 PM. The travel time from Presidio to Russian Hill is 14 minutes, so I can leave Presidio at 5:30 PM to arrive by 6:30 PM.\n\nBut wait, I need to ensure I'm not double-booking myself. Maybe I should split the meetings into two sessions: one in the morning and one in the late afternoon.\n\nSo, first session:\n\n1. Chinatown at 8:15 AM to meet Michelle for 15 minutes.\n2. Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM to meet Robert for 30 minutes.\n3. Presidio at 10:30 AM to meet George for 30 minutes.\n\nSecond session:\n\n1. Russian Hill at 6:30 PM to meet William for 105 minutes.\n\nThis way, I can cover all four meetings without overlapping. I just need to make sure the travel times are manageable and that I have enough time between meetings.\n\nAdditionally, I need to consider the time taken to travel between locations. For example, from Chinatown to Fisherman's Wharf is 8 minutes, and from Fisherman's Wharf to Presidio is 17 minutes. So, after meeting Robert at 9:00 AM, I can go to Presidio by 9:38 AM, meeting George at 10:30 AM.\n\nThen, after meeting George, I can head to Russian Hill, leaving Presidio at 11:00 AM, arriving by 6:24 PM to meet William.\n\nThis seems feasible. I also need to make sure I'm not missing any constraints or exceeding the minimum meeting times.\n\nIn summary, my plan is:\n\n- Start at Chinatown at 8:15 AM to meet Michelle.\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM to meet Robert.\n- Travel to Presidio at 10:30 AM to meet George.\n- Travel to Russian Hill at 6:30 PM to meet William.\n\nThis schedule allows me to meet all four friends without overlapping or rushing, considering the travel distances and constraints provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Michelle\",\n      \"start_time\": \"08:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"08:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Presidio\",\n      \"person\": \"George\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"William\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
