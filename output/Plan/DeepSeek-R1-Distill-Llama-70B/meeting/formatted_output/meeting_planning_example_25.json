The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and constraints. They\u2019ve provided a bunch of travel distances between different locations and some specific constraints about when each person is available.\n\nAlright, let me start by understanding the problem. The user arrives at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. They need to meet David, who\u2019s in Chinatown from 4:00 PM to 9:45 PM. The minimum meeting time is 105 minutes, which is 1 hour and 45 minutes. So, the challenge here is figuring out when and where to meet David given the travel times and the fact that the user is starting at Golden Gate Park.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the travel distances between Golden Gate Park and Chinatown. The distance is 23 minutes. That's manageable. But the issue is the timing. The user arrives at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM, and David isn\u2019t available until 4:00 PM. So, the user has a big window from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM to plan their day, but they can only meet David during his availability.\n\nWait, but the user wants to meet as many friends as possible. Does that mean they should try to meet multiple people? But the constraints only mention David. Maybe the user is only meeting David. Or perhaps there are more people to meet, but in this case, the constraints only specify David. Hmm.\n\nGiven that, the main focus is on meeting David. The user needs to go from Golden Gate Park to Chinatown to meet David. The travel time is 23 minutes. So, the user could potentially leave Golden Gate Park at any time before 4:00 PM, travel to Chinatown, and meet David for at least 105 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the user arrives at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. They can spend the morning and early afternoon doing other things, but they need to ensure they have enough time to get to Chinatown by 4:00 PM to meet David.\n\nSo, the latest they can leave Golden Gate Park is 4:00 PM minus the travel time, which is 23 minutes. That means they need to leave by 3:37 PM to arrive by 4:00 PM. But they might want to factor in some buffer time in case of any delays.\n\nAlso, the meeting needs to last at least 105 minutes. So, they should plan to spend enough time with David. That means they need to arrive before 4:00 PM and leave after 5:45 PM, considering the 105-minute meeting.\n\nBut wait, David is available until 9:45 PM. So, technically, the meeting could be scheduled later, but the user might want to minimize travel time and schedule other meetings if possible.\n\nHowever, since the constraints only mention David, maybe the user is only meeting him. In that case, the plan would be to travel from Golden Gate Park to Chinatown, meet David for 105 minutes, and then perhaps have flexibility for other meetings if possible.\n\nBut the user's goal is to meet as many friends as possible. So, maybe they should try to fit in other meetings before or after meeting David. However, without more constraints, it's hard to plan that.\n\nSo, focusing on meeting David, the best approach is to leave Golden Gate Park as late as possible to arrive in Chinatown just in time for their meeting. That way, the user can maximize their time elsewhere before needing to go to Chinatown.\n\nGiven that, the user can leave Golden Gate Park at 3:37 PM, arrive in Chinatown at 4:00 PM, and meet David until 5:45 PM. This meets the 105-minute requirement.\n\nAlternatively, they could leave earlier and have more time to explore other areas, but since the user wants to meet as many friends as possible, maybe they can fit in another meeting before going to Chinatown.\n\nBut without knowing who else they need to meet, it's safer to assume they're only meeting David today. Therefore, the plan is to leave Golden Gate Park at 3:37 PM, arrive at Chinatown at 4:00 PM, and meet David until 5:45 PM.\n\nThis way, the user is efficient with their time, ensuring they can meet David without rushing and have the necessary travel time.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
