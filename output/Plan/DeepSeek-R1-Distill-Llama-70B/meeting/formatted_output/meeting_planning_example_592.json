            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to help schedule a day of meetings in San Francisco. The user has provided a lot of travel distances between different locations and some constraints about when each person is available. My goal is to create the most efficient meeting schedule possible, maximizing the number of friends met while considering travel times and constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The user arrives at North Beach at 9:00 AM. Then, there are several people available at different locations at specific times with varying meeting durations. My job is to figure out the best times and locations to meet each person without backtracking too much, as that would take up too much time.\n\nLooking at the travel distances, I see that North Beach is connected to several other areas, and the distances vary. For example, North Beach to Pacific Heights is 8 minutes, while North Beach to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes. This means some locations are closer and can be reached quickly, while others require more time.\n\nStarting with the user's arrival at North Beach at 9:00 AM, the first thought is to meet someone nearby to save travel time. Sandra is at Nob Hill from 8:00 AM to 3:30 PM. Nob Hill is only 7 minutes away, so it makes sense to meet Sandra early to take advantage of the short travel time. Meeting her at 9:00 AM seems ideal.\n\nNext, Jeffrey is at Union Square from 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM. Union Square is 10 minutes away from North Beach. To meet Jeffrey, the user can go from North Beach to Union Square, which takes 10 minutes. After meeting Jeffrey, the user might consider where to go next based on the next available person.\n\nRobert is at Chinatown from 12:15 PM to 4:45 PM. Chinatown is 6 minutes away from North Beach. Meeting Robert later in the morning might be possible, but considering the time after meeting Sandra and Jeffrey, it might be better to schedule Robert for a time after the initial meetings.\n\nMark is at Golden Gate Park from 11:30 AM to 5:45 PM. Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes away. This seems a bit far, but if Mark is only available until 5:45 PM, it might be better to meet him later in the day.\n\nCarol is at Mission District from 6:15 PM to 9:15 PM. Mission District is 18 minutes away. This is a longer travel time, but Carol is only available in the evening, so it's necessary to meet her then.\n\nJames is at Pacific Heights from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM. Pacific Heights is 8 minutes away. Meeting James in the evening seems feasible since he's available late.\n\nNow, considering the travel times and constraints, I need to create a timeline that allows the user to move between locations efficiently without spending too much time traveling. Starting at North Beach, meeting Sandra at 9:00 AM, then moving to Union Square to meet Jeffrey at 9:30 AM, then to Chinatown to meet Robert at 12:15 PM, followed by Golden Gate Park to meet Mark at 11:30 AM, but that might not align perfectly. Alternatively, after meeting Sandra, go to Golden Gate Park to meet Mark at 11:30 AM, then to Union Square to meet Jeffrey at 9:30 AM\u2014wait, that doesn't make sense because time is moving forward.\n\nI think a better approach is to meet the closest and earliest available person first, then move to the next location. So, Sandra at 9:00 AM in Nob Hill, then Jeffrey at 9:30 AM in Union Square, then Robert at 12:15 PM in Chinatown, then Mark at 11:30 AM in Golden Gate Park, but that would require going back to Golden Gate Park after meeting Jeffrey, which might be too much. Alternatively, after meeting Sandra and Jeffrey, go to Chinatown to meet Robert at 12:15 PM, then proceed to Golden Gate Park to meet Mark at 11:30 AM, but that's conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the initial plan might need adjustment. Perhaps it's better to meet the closest person first, then the next closest, and so on, ensuring that travel times are minimized and meetings are scheduled in a logical order.\n\nAnother consideration is the meeting durations. Some people need 15 minutes, while others need up to 120 minutes. Longer meetings should be scheduled when the user has more time or when the travel to that location is efficient.\n\nIn this case, Sandra's meeting is only 15 minutes, so it's quick and efficient to meet her first. Jeffrey needs 120 minutes, so it's better to meet him later in the day when the user has more time. Robert needs 90 minutes, so meeting him mid-day seems appropriate. Mark only needs 15 minutes, so meeting him earlier or later could work, depending on the schedule.\n\nCarol's meeting is 15 minutes, which is short, so it's best to meet her in the evening after other meetings. James's meeting is 120 minutes, which is longer, so it's better to meet him in the evening as well.\n\nConsidering all this, a possible schedule could be:\n\n1. Meet Sandra at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM for 15 minutes.\n2. Travel to Union Square to meet Jeffrey from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM (120 minutes).\n3. Travel to Chinatown to meet Robert from 12:15 PM to 1:45 PM (90 minutes).\n4. Travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Mark from 11:30 AM to 11:45 AM (15 minutes). However, this would require going back to Golden Gate Park after meeting Robert, which might be too time-consuming.\n   \nAlternatively:\n\n1. Meet Sandra at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM for 15 minutes.\n2. Travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Mark at 11:30 AM for 15 minutes.\n3. Travel to Union Square to meet Jeffrey from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM (120 minutes). Wait, this is conflicting because 9:30 AM is before 11:30 AM. Need to adjust the order.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to meet Sandra first, then Jeffrey, then Robert, and finally Mark, ensuring that travel times are minimized and meetings are scheduled in a logical sequence.\n\nFinalizing the itinerary:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Meet Sandra at Nob Hill for 15 minutes.\n- 9:30 AM: Travel to Union Square to meet Jeffrey for 120 minutes.\n- 12:15 PM: Travel to Chinatown to meet Robert for 90 minutes.\n- 1:45 PM: Travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Mark for 15 minutes.\n- 2:00 PM: Travel to North Beach to meet William for 15 minutes.\n- 6:15 PM: Travel to Mission District to meet Carol for 15 minutes.\n- 7:00 PM: Travel to Presidio to meet Joshua for 105 minutes.\n- 8:45 PM: Travel to Bayview to meet Ashley for 105 minutes.\n\nThis schedule considers the travel times and constraints, ensuring that the user meets as many friends as possible without excessive travel.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Nob Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"William\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Presidio\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"person\": \"Ashley\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
