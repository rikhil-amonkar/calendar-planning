            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to schedule my meetings in San Francisco for the day. I arrive at Bayview at 9:00 AM, and I need to meet several friends who are each located in different districts. The goal is to meet as many people as possible while considering the travel times and the constraints of each person's availability.\n\nFirst, I need to list out all the people I need to meet and their locations:\n\n1. Mary - Pacific Heights\n2. Lisa - Mission District\n3. Betty - Haight-Ashbury\n4. Charles - Financial District\n\nEach of them has specific time slots when they're available, and I need to make sure that I meet each of them for the required minimum time. Additionally, I need to account for the travel time between locations to ensure I don't miss any meetings.\n\nStarting with Mary, she's available from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM in Pacific Heights. Since I arrive at Bayview at 9:00 AM, I need to plan my day starting from there. Mary's schedule is quite long, so I should aim to meet her as early as possible to leave more time for other meetings.\n\nNext, Betty is available from 7:15 AM to 5:15 PM in Haight-Ashbury. That's a longer window, so I can be a bit more flexible with her meeting time, but I still want to meet her early to maximize the rest of my day.\n\nCharles is available from 11:15 AM to 3:00 PM in the Financial District. This is a shorter window, so I need to make sure I can get to the Financial District during this time without conflicting with other meetings.\n\nLisa is available from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM in the Mission District. This is a late window, so I need to plan the later part of my day around this.\n\nNow, considering the travel distances between Bayview and each location:\n\n- Bayview to Pacific Heights: 23 minutes\n- Bayview to Mission District: 13 minutes\n- Bayview to Haight-Ashbury: 19 minutes\n- Bayview to Financial District: 19 minutes\n\nI need to make sure that the time I spend traveling doesn't eat into my meeting times. For example, if I leave Bayview at 9:23 AM to go to Pacific Heights, I'll arrive at 9:23 + 23 = 9:46 AM, which is before Mary's 10:00 AM start time. That works.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to the Mission District first, I can leave Bayview at 9:13 AM, arriving at 9:26 AM, which is earlier than Mary's time but later than Betty's availability. Wait, no, Betty is available starting at 7:15 AM, so I could potentially meet her earlier.\n\nBut I need to consider that I can only be in one place at a time. So I have to choose the order of meetings in a way that minimizes travel time between them.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible schedule:\n\n1. Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet Betty first at Haight-Ashbury. The travel time is 19 minutes, so I can leave Bayview at 9:00 AM, arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 9:19 AM. Since Betty is available from 7:15 AM, meeting her at 9:19 AM is feasible.\n3. After meeting Betty, I need to travel to the next location. Let's see, from Haight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights. The distance is 11 minutes. So if I leave at 9:30 AM, I'll arrive at Pacific Heights at 9:41 AM, which is before Mary's 10:00 AM start time. That works. So meet Mary from 9:41 AM to 10:26 AM (45 minutes).\n4. Then, travel from Pacific Heights to Financial District. The distance is 13 minutes. If I leave at 10:26 AM, I'll arrive at 10:39 AM. Charles is available from 11:15 AM, so I have some time. Maybe I can do something else in the meantime. Alternatively, I can wait until 11:15 AM to meet Charles. So, I can spend some time in the Financial District before Charles is available.\n5. After meeting Charles from 11:15 AM to 12:45 PM, I can then travel to the Mission District. The distance from Financial District to Mission District is 17 minutes. So, leaving at 12:45 PM, I'll arrive at 1:02 PM. Lisa is available from 8:30 PM, which is later, so I can meet her later.\n6. After that, I can travel back to Bayview or to another location. But since Lisa is available in the evening, I can plan to meet her later in the day.\n\nWait, but I already have a meeting with Charles at 11:15 AM, which is after Mary's meeting. So, perhaps I need to adjust the order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should meet Charles earlier. Let me reconsider.\n\nAnother approach:\n\n1. Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet Betty at Haight-Ashbury at 9:19 AM.\n3. Travel to Pacific Heights (11 minutes) arriving at 9:30 AM, meet Mary until 10:15 AM.\n4. Then, travel to Financial District (13 minutes), arriving at 10:28 AM. Since Charles isn't available until 11:15 AM, I can spend some time exploring or waiting.\n5. Meet Charles from 11:15 AM to 12:45 PM.\n6. Then, travel to Mission District (17 minutes), arriving at 1:02 PM. Lisa is available from 8:30 PM, so I can meet her later.\n7. After that, I can travel back to Bayview or another location, but since I've already met Betty, Mary, and Charles, and Lisa is available in the evening, maybe I can end my day after meeting Charles.\n\nWait, but I need to meet Lisa as well. So, I need to fit that in.\n\nPerhaps, after meeting Charles at 12:45 PM, I can go to the Mission District. Travel time is 17 minutes, so I can leave at 12:45 PM, arriving at 1:02 PM. Lisa is available from 8:30 PM, which is much later. So, I can plan to meet Lisa from 8:30 PM to 9:45 PM.\n\nBut that leaves a lot of time in between. I need to make sure I don't have any other meetings in between.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can adjust the order to meet Lisa earlier, but her availability is from 8:30 PM, which is late. So, it's better to leave it for later.\n\nSo, summarizing the schedule:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Arrive at Bayview\n- 9:19 AM: Meet Betty at Haight-Ashbury\n- 9:30 AM: Travel to Pacific Heights, arrive at 9:41 AM\n- 9:41 AM - 10:26 AM: Meet Mary\n- 10:28 AM: Travel to Financial District, arrive at 10:41 AM\n- 11:15 AM - 12:45 PM: Meet Charles\n- 12:45 PM: Travel to Mission District, arrive at 1:02 PM\n- 8:30 PM - 9:45 PM: Meet Lisa\n\nThis seems to cover all the required meetings with the necessary travel times and constraints.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the travel times are accurate and that I'm not double-booking myself.\n\nWait, from Financial District to Mission District is 17 minutes, so leaving at 12:45 PM, arriving at 1:02 PM. That's correct.\n\nAlso, from Bayview to Haight-Ashbury is 19 minutes, so leaving at 9:00 AM, arriving at 9:19 AM.\n\nFrom Haight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights is 11 minutes, so leaving at 9:30 AM, arriving at 9:41 AM.\n\nFrom Pacific Heights to Financial District is 13 minutes, leaving at 10:26 AM, arriving at 10:39 AM.\n\nFrom Financial District to Mission District is 17 minutes, leaving at 12:45 PM, arriving at 1:02 PM.\n\nAnd finally, from Mission District to Bayview is 15 minutes, leaving at 9:45 PM, arriving at 10:00 PM.\n\nWait, but I need to end my day after meeting Lisa, so perhaps I can end there.\n\nBut in the initial plan, I have only four meetings: Betty, Mary, Charles, and Lisa. But the user mentioned five friends: Mary, Lisa, Betty, Charles, and another person, but in the constraints, it's only four people. Wait, checking the constraints:\n\n\"Mary will be at Pacific Heights from 10:00AM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet Mary for a minimum of 45 minutes. Lisa will be at Mission District from 8:30PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Lisa for a minimum of 75 minutes. Betty will be at Haight-Ashbury from 7:15AM to 5:15PM. You'd like to meet Betty for a minimum of 90 minutes. Charles will be at Financial District from 11:15AM to 3:00PM. You'd like to meet Charles for a minimum of 120 minutes.\"\n\nSo, only four people: Mary, Lisa, Betty, Charles. So, the initial plan covers all four.\n\nBut in the initial problem statement, it says \"meet as many friends as possible,\" which implies that there are more friends, but in the constraints, only four are mentioned. So, perhaps the initial plan is correct.\n\nBut in the last message, the user wrote:\n\n\"Your response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nPlease provide your meeting plan in the following exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Location Name\", \"person\": \"Person Name\", \"start_time\": \"H:MM\", \"end_time\": \"H:MM\"}\n  ]\n}\nNote: Times should be in 24-hour format without leading zeros (e.g., '9:30' not '09:30', '13:30' not '1:30PM').\"\n\nSo, the response should have an itinerary with two meetings. But in the problem, there are four friends to meet. This seems contradictory. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I'll proceed with the initial plan as per the constraints provided.\n\nSo, the final itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Betty at Haight-Ashbury at 9:19 AM.\n2. Meet Mary at Pacific Heights at 9:41 AM.\n3. Meet Charles at Financial District at 11:15 AM.\n4. Meet Lisa at Mission District at 8:30 PM.\n\nBut the JSON format requires only two meetings, so perhaps the user expects to meet the most critical or the maximum number of people, but in this case, the constraints only allow for four people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the constraints again.\n\nMary: Pacific Heights 10:00 AM - 7:00 PM\nLisa: Mission District 8:30 PM - 10:00 PM\nBetty: Haight-Ashbury 7:15 AM - 5:15 PM\nCharles: Financial District 11:15 AM - 3:00 PM\n\nSo, four people. Therefore, the itinerary should include all four meetings.\n\nBut the JSON format allows for more than two meetings, but the user's last message shows only two meetings. So, perhaps the user wants to meet as many as possible, but based on the constraints, only four are possible.\n\nTherefore, the final solution should include all four meetings.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\", \"person\": \"Betty\", \"start_time\": \"09:19\", \"end_time\": \"10:09\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"09:41\", \"end_time\": \"10:26\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"person\": \"Charles\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"12:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Mission District\", \"person\": \"Lisa\", \"start_time\": \"20:30\", \"end_time\": \"21:15\"}\n  ]\n}",
