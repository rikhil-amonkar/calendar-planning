The user has provided a series of constraints and travel distances, and they want an optimized schedule to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The user arrives at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. There are four people to meet: Betty at Presidio, David at Richmond District, Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf, and one more, but it seems only three are mentioned. Each has specific time windows and minimum meeting durations.\n\nI'll start by listing the possible locations: Embarcadero, Presidio, Richmond District, and Fisherman's Wharf. The distances between these locations are provided, which will help in planning the travel times.\n\nBetty is at Presidio from 10:15 AM to 9:30 PM. The minimum meeting time is 45 minutes. Since she's at Presidio, I need to consider travel time from Embarcadero to Presidio, which is 20 minutes. \n\nNext, David is at Richmond District from 1:00 PM to 8:15 PM, requiring a 90-minute meeting. Richmond District is 21 minutes from Embarcadero, but considering travel from Presidio to Richmond District is 7 minutes, I need to check if it's feasible to go from Presidio to Richmond District after meeting Betty.\n\nBarbara is at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15 AM to 8:15 PM, needing a 120-minute meeting. Fisherman's Wharf is only 6 minutes from Embarcadero, which is convenient.\n\nI need to ensure that each meeting doesn't overlap and that travel times are accounted for. Since Barbara is available early, it makes sense to meet her first at Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nAfter meeting Barbara, the next earliest time would be around 10:15 AM, which aligns with Betty's availability at Presidio. Traveling from Fisherman's Wharf to Presidio is 17 minutes, which is manageable.\n\nThen, after meeting Betty, the next available time would be around 11:00 AM. However, David isn't available until 1:00 PM. So, there's a gap. I can suggest a break or maybe adjust the schedule if possible, but since the user wants to maximize meetings, I'll proceed to meet David as soon as possible.\n\nDavid's meeting is 90 minutes, so starting at 1:00 PM seems ideal. Traveling from Presidio to Richmond District takes 7 minutes, which is quick.\n\nFinally, after meeting David, the schedule ends, but the user might have more time. However, based on the constraints, that's the last meeting possible.\n\nI need to make sure the itinerary is in the correct JSON format, with each meeting's location, person, start, and end times. Also, times should be in 24-hour format without leading zeros.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n1. Meet Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15 AM to 10:15 AM.\n2. Travel to Presidio and meet Betty from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM.\n3. Travel to Richmond District and meet David from 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM.\n\nThis schedule respects all constraints and optimizes the number of meetings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Presidio\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Richmond District\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
