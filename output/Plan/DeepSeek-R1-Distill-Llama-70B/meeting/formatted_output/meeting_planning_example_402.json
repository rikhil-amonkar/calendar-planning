            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help this person schedule their meetings in San Francisco. They want to meet as many friends as possible, so efficiency is key. Let's see what the constraints are and what the travel distances are.\n\nFirst, the person arrives at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. They need to meet Sarah at Haight-Ashbury, which is 7 minutes away. But Sarah is only available from 5:00 PM to 9:30 PM. That's a long time gap. Maybe they can meet her in the evening after other meetings.\n\nNext, Patricia is at Sunset District from 5:00 PM to 7:45 PM. The Sunset District is 10 minutes from Golden Gate Park. Patricia only needs 45 minutes, so that's manageable.\n\nMatthew is at Marina District from 9:15 AM to 12:00 PM. The Marina District is 16 minutes away. He only needs 15 minutes, so that's quick.\n\nJoseph is at Financial District from 2:15 PM to 6:45 PM. That's a bit later, but he only needs 30 minutes. That should be doable.\n\nRobert is at Union Square from 10:15 AM to 9:45 PM. He's only 9 minutes away from Golden Gate Park. They need just 15 minutes.\n\nSo, the plan is to start with the earliest possible meetings. Maybe meet Matthew first at Marina District right after arriving. Then, head to Union Square to meet Robert. After that, go to Haight-Ashbury to meet Sarah. Then, go to Sunset District to meet Patricia. Finally, head to Financial District to meet Joseph.\n\nWait, but the travel times need to be considered. From Golden Gate Park to Marina District is 16 minutes. Then, from Marina District to Union Square is 16 minutes. Then, Union Square to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. Then, Haight-Ashbury to Sunset District is 15 minutes. Sunset District to Financial District is 30 minutes.\n\nBut the person needs to leave enough time between meetings to move around. Also, making sure that each meeting has the required minimum time.\n\nLet me check the times again. Starting at 9:00 AM, going to Marina District for Matthew at 9:16 AM. Then to Union Square by 9:32 AM. Then to Haight-Ashbury by 9:50 AM. Then to Sunset District by 10:10 AM. Then to Financial District by 10:40 AM.\n\nWait, but Patricia is available until 7:45 PM, and Joseph until 6:45 PM. So, maybe it's better to do Patricia first before Joseph. Let me adjust the order.\n\nMaybe meet Patricia at Sunset District at 5:10 PM, then go to Haight-Ashbury for Sarah at 5:40 PM, then to Financial District for Joseph at 6:10 PM, and finally to Union Square for Robert at 6:40 PM.\n\nBut then, the person would need to travel back to Golden Gate Park after each meeting, which adds to the time. This might be too tight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe prioritize the longer meetings first. Sarah needs 105 minutes, so that's the most time. Then Patricia needs 45 minutes, Matthew 15, Robert 15, and Joseph 30.\n\nSo, perhaps meet Sarah first, then Patricia, then the others. But the timing needs to be precise.\n\nWait, the person can't be in two places at once. So, they need to plan a route that allows them to move between locations without overlapping.\n\nMaybe start with Sarah at Haight-Ashbury in the evening, then go to Sunset District for Patricia, then to Financial District for Joseph, and finally to Union Square for Robert.\n\nBut the travel times need to be accounted for. From Haight-Ashbury to Sunset District is 15 minutes. Sunset District to Financial District is 30 minutes. Financial District to Union Square is 9 minutes. That should work.\n\nSo, the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Sarah at Haight-Ashbury from 5:00 PM to 6:45 PM.\n2. Travel to Sunset District, arriving by 5:15 PM.\n3. Meet Patricia from 5:15 PM to 6:00 PM.\n4. Travel to Financial District, arriving by 6:15 PM.\n5. Meet Joseph from 6:15 PM to 6:45 PM.\n6. Travel to Union Square, arriving by 6:45 PM.\n7. Meet Robert from 6:45 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nThat seems to fit. Each meeting has the required minimum time, and the travel times are manageable.\n\nBut wait, the person arrives at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. Do they have time to do all these meetings? From 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM is a long day. Maybe they need to do some meetings in the morning as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they can do the morning meetings first, then have a break, and then do the evening meetings.\n\nBut the constraints specify that they need to meet Sarah for 105 minutes, which is the longest. So, it's better to prioritize that.\n\nIn the end, the plan is to meet Sarah first, then Patricia, then Joseph, and finally Robert, ensuring that each meeting has the required time and the travel between locations is feasible within the day.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Sunset District\",\n      \"person\": \"Patricia\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
