They've given me a bunch of travel distances between different locations and some constraints. Let me try to figure out the best way to meet as many friends as possible.\n\nFirst, I see that the person arrives at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. They need to meet two people: Stephanie in the Financial District and John in Alamo Square. The problem is that both Stephanie and John have specific time windows when they're available.\n\nStephanie is at the Financial District from 8:15 AM to 11:30 AM. That gives me a window to meet her until 11:30 AM. John is at Alamo Square from 10:15 AM to 8:45 PM, so he's available most of the day, but I need to meet him for at least 30 minutes.\n\nI need to figure out how to schedule these meetings without overlapping and ensuring the travel times are considered. Also, I should aim to meet as many friends as possible, but in this case, it seems like only two meetings are needed based on the constraints provided.\n\nLet me think about the travel distances. From Embarcadero to Financial District is 5 minutes, and from there to Alamo Square is 17 minutes. Alternatively, from Embarcadero to Alamo Square is 19 minutes, and from there to Financial District is 17 minutes.\n\nIf I meet Stephanie first in the Financial District, that's a quick 5-minute walk from Embarcadero. Then, from there, I can go to Alamo Square, which is 17 minutes away. But wait, that would take 5 + 17 = 22 minutes, which is a bit tight if I need to meet her until 11:30 AM.\n\nAlternatively, I could go to Alamo Square first. From Embarcadero to Alamo Square is 19 minutes, and then from Alamo Square to Financial District is 17 minutes. That would take 19 + 17 = 36 minutes, which is more manageable.\n\nBut I also need to consider the time I have with each person. If I meet Stephanie first, I have until 11:30 AM, but I can't spend the entire time with her because I need to go to Alamo Square to meet John.\n\nWait, maybe I can meet Stephanie first, then go to Alamo Square to meet John. Let me calculate the time. Starting at 9:00 AM, meeting Stephanie until 11:30 AM, then traveling to Alamo Square, which takes 17 minutes. So I can meet John from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, which is 30 minutes. That works because John is available until 8:45 PM.\n\nAlternatively, if I meet John first, I can go to Alamo Square from 9:00 AM, but that's a 19-minute walk. Then, I can go to Financial District to meet Stephanie, which is 17 minutes away. But that would mean I'm spending more time traveling, and I might not have enough time to meet Stephanie until 11:30 AM.\n\nHmm, it seems better to meet Stephanie first to take advantage of the earlier time slot and then move to Alamo Square to meet John. That way, I'm not rushing and can have enough time with each person.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Meet Stephanie in Financial District from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. That gives me 60 minutes with her, which is more than the required 30 minutes.\n\n2. Then, travel from Financial District to Alamo Square, which takes 17 minutes, arriving at 11:17 AM.\n\n3. Meet John from 11:17 AM to 11:47 AM, which is 30 minutes.\n\nThis way, I'm meeting both Stephanie and John within their available time windows and have enough time for each meeting without overlapping.\n\nI think this is a good plan. It uses the travel times effectively and ensures I can meet both friends without missing any deadlines.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"John\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:17\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:47\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
