            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best meeting schedule for this day in San Francisco. The user wants to meet as many friends as possible, considering the travel times and constraints. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the locations and the travel distances provided. The main locations involved are North Beach, Pacific Heights, and Embarcadero. The travel times between these places are given, which will help in planning the meetings without making the user travel too much, especially since they've just arrived at North Beach at 9:00 AM.\n\nNext, looking at the constraints, the user arrives at North Beach at 9:00 AM. They have three people to meet: Karen in Pacific Heights from 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM, Mark in Embarcadero from 1:00 PM to 5:45 PM, and they can meet Mark for a minimum of 120 minutes, Karen for 90 minutes, and there's no specific time constraint mentioned for the other person, but since the user wants to meet as many as possible, I assume we can fit in all three.\n\nNow, the challenge is to schedule these meetings in a way that minimizes travel time between locations and ensures that each meeting has the required duration without overlapping with the other person's availability.\n\nStarting with Mark, who's at Embarcadero from 1:00 PM to 5:45 PM. Since the user arrives at North Beach at 9:00 AM, they have several hours before Mark becomes available. The user needs to travel from North Beach to Embarcadero, which takes 6 minutes. So, the earliest they can meet Mark is at 1:06 PM.\n\nBut wait, the user can't just teleport; they need to plan the day. They have to move from North Beach to the first meeting location, then possibly move to another location for the next meeting, and so on.\n\nLet me consider the possible sequences:\n\n1. Meet Mark first, then Karen, then the third person (if possible).\n2. Meet the third person first, then Mark, then Karen.\n3. Meet Karen first, then Mark, then the third person.\n\nEach option has its pros and cons in terms of travel times and meeting durations.\n\nOption 1: Meet Mark at Embarcadero at 1:06 PM. After that, the user needs to travel to Pacific Heights to meet Karen. The travel time from Embarcadero to Pacific Heights is 11 minutes, so they can meet Karen at 1:17 PM. But Karen is available until 8:15 PM, so there's a lot of time. However, the user needs to meet her for 90 minutes, so the meeting would end at 2:07 PM. Then, from Pacific Heights, the user needs to go back to North Beach, which takes 9 minutes, arriving at 2:16 PM. But the user might have other meetings after that.\n\nOption 2: Meet the third person first. But there's no third person mentioned, so this might not apply here.\n\nOption 3: Meet Karen first. Karen is available starting at 6:45 PM, so the user needs to be there by 6:45 PM. That would require the user to be at North Beach until 6:45 PM, but they've already arrived at 9:00 AM. So, the user can be at North Beach all day, but they need to meet Karen for 90 minutes, so the meeting would end at 7:35 PM. Then, they need to go to Embarcadero to meet Mark, which takes 6 minutes, arriving at 7:41 PM. Mark is available until 5:45 PM, so this doesn't work because 7:41 PM is after Mark's availability.\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense. So, meeting Karen first isn't feasible because it would require the user to wait until 6:45 PM, but Mark's window is earlier.\n\nTherefore, Option 1 seems better: meet Mark first, then Karen.\n\nMark's meeting starts at 1:06 PM at Embarcadero. After that, the user travels to Pacific Heights, which is 11 minutes, arriving at 1:17 PM. They meet Karen for 90 minutes, ending at 2:07 PM. Then, the user needs to return to North Beach, which takes 9 minutes, arriving at 2:16 PM.\n\nNow, the user has the rest of the day free until Karen's availability ends at 8:15 PM. But the user needs to meet as many friends as possible, and since all the required meetings are already scheduled, maybe the user can fit in another meeting.\n\nWait, the user only has three friends to meet: Karen, Mark, and potentially another person, but the problem only mentions Karen and Mark. So, the user has met both Karen and Mark, and the third person is not mentioned, so perhaps that's all.\n\nBut the user wants to meet as many friends as possible, so maybe there's another friend I'm missing. Let me check the constraints again.\n\nAh, the user mentioned meeting Karen, Mark, and possibly another person, but in the constraints, only Karen and Mark are listed. So, the user has met both Karen and Mark.\n\nHowever, the user might have time to meet another person if possible. Let me see.\n\nAfter meeting Karen at 2:07 PM, the user is at Pacific Heights. From there, the user can go to Embarcadero again to meet Mark, but Mark is already done by 5:45 PM. Alternatively, the user can go to another location, but there's no other friend mentioned.\n\nSo, the optimal schedule is to meet Mark first, then Karen.\n\nWait, but the user could also consider meeting Mark later, but Mark's availability is until 5:45 PM. If the user meets Karen first, they would have to wait until 6:45 PM, which might conflict with Mark's availability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Mark in the afternoon and Karen in the evening.\n\nBut considering the travel times, it's better to meet Mark first to minimize travel.\n\nSo, the final schedule would be:\n\n- 1:06 PM: Meet Mark at Embarcadero.\n- 1:17 PM: Travel to Pacific Heights.\n- 1:17 PM to 2:07 PM: Meet Karen for 90 minutes.\n- 2:07 PM: Return to North Beach by 2:16 PM.\n\nThis way, the user has met both Karen and Mark, and the travel times are minimized, allowing the user to have a full day without excessive waiting.\n\nI think that's the best possible schedule given the constraints.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Embarcadero\", \"person\": \"Mark\", \"start_time\": \"13:06\", \"end_time\": \"14:26\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"13:17\", \"end_time\": \"14:07\"}\n  ]\n}",
