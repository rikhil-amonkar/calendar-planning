            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to help this user schedule their meetings in San Francisco. They've provided a lot of travel distances between different locations and a set of constraints. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user arrives at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM. They want to meet as many friends as possible, so I need to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping in a way that respects everyone's availability and the required meeting times.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the people they need to meet and their available time windows:\n\n1. **Linda** at Marina District from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM. They need at least 30 minutes.\n2. **Kenneth** at The Castro from 2:45 PM to 4:15 PM. At least 30 minutes.\n3. **Kimberly** at Richmond District from 2:15 PM to 10:00 PM. At least 30 minutes.\n4. **Paul** at Alamo Square from 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM. At least 15 minutes.\n5. **Carol** at Financial District from 10:15 AM to 12:00 PM. At least 60 minutes.\n6. **Brian** at Presidio from 10:00 AM to 9:30 PM. At least 75 minutes.\n7. **Laura** at Mission District from 4:15 PM to 8:30 PM. At least 30 minutes.\n8. **Sandra** at Nob Hill from 9:15 AM to 6:30 PM. At least 60 minutes.\n9. **Karen** at Russian Hill from 6:30 PM to 10:00 PM. At least 75 minutes.\n\nStarting with **Carol**, she's available from 10:15 AM to 12:00 PM in the Financial District. Since she needs 60 minutes, I can schedule her first thing in the morning. The travel time from Pacific Heights to Financial District is 13 minutes. If I meet her at 10:15 AM, that gives us until 11:15 AM to end the meeting, which is enough.\n\nNext, **Brian** is at Presidio from 10:00 AM to 9:30 PM. He needs 75 minutes. The travel time from Pacific Heights to Presidio is 11 minutes. To meet him, I can go from Pacific Heights to Presidio at 10:00 AM, but that might conflict with Carol's meeting. Alternatively, maybe after meeting Carol, but let's see.\n\n**Sandra** is at Nob Hill from 9:15 AM to 6:30 PM. She needs 60 minutes. Nob Hill is close to Pacific Heights, only 8 minutes away. I can meet her right after arriving at 9:15 AM. That would take until 10:15 AM, which is perfect because Carol's meeting starts at 10:15. So Sandra at 9:15 AM and Carol at 10:15 AM.\n\nNow, **Kenneth** is at The Castro from 2:45 PM to 4:15 PM. He needs 30 minutes. The Castro is a bit further, so I'll need to plan the travel time. From Pacific Heights to The Castro is 16 minutes. If I meet him at 2:45 PM, that gives a 30-minute window, ending at 3:15 PM.\n\n**Kenneth** is at The Castro, so next, maybe **Kenneth** to **Laura** at Mission District. Mission District is 20 minutes from The Castro. Laura is available from 4:15 PM to 8:30 PM. If I leave The Castro at 3:15 PM, I can arrive at Mission District by 3:35 PM. That's a bit early, but I can wait until 4:15 PM to start the meeting. That gives us until 4:45 PM, which is 30 minutes. So Laura at 4:15 PM.\n\nThen, **Laura** to **Kimberly** at Richmond District. Richmond District is 20 minutes from Mission District. Kimberly is available from 2:15 PM to 10:00 PM. If I leave Mission District at 4:45 PM, I can arrive at Richmond District by 5:05 PM. That's within her available time. Meeting her from 5:05 PM to 5:35 PM gives 30 minutes.\n\nNext, **Kimberly** to **Linda** at Marina District. Marina District is 9 minutes from Richmond District. Linda is available from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM. If I leave Richmond District at 5:35 PM, I can arrive at Marina District by 5:44 PM. Meeting Linda from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM fits her availability.\n\nThen, **Linda** to **Karen** at Russian Hill. Russian Hill is 8 minutes from Marina District. Karen is available from 6:30 PM to 10:00 PM. Meeting her from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM works well.\n\n**Karen** to **Paul** at Alamo Square. Alamo Square is 15 minutes from Russian Hill. Paul is available from 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM. If I leave Russian Hill at 7:30 PM, I can arrive at Alamo Square by 7:45 PM. But Paul's meeting starts at 9:00 PM, so I need to wait until then. That gives us a 15-minute meeting from 9:00 PM to 9:15 PM.\n\nFinally, **Paul** to **Brian** at Presidio. Presidio is 19 minutes from Alamo Square. Brian is available until 9:30 PM. If I leave Alamo Square at 9:15 PM, I can arrive at Presidio by 9:34 PM. That's within his availability. Meeting Brian from 9:15 PM to 9:50 PM gives 35 minutes, which is more than the required 75 minutes, but I can adjust the time if needed.\n\nWait, but Brian needs 75 minutes. I only gave 35 minutes. That's a problem. I need to adjust the schedule to ensure each meeting meets the minimum time requirement.\n\nLet me go back. Maybe I can combine some meetings or adjust the order to accommodate Brian's longer meeting. Perhaps meeting Brian earlier would help. Let's try:\n\n- **Brian** at Presidio from 10:00 AM to 9:30 PM. If I meet him at 10:00 AM, that's 75 minutes. But Carol is at Financial District until 12:00 PM. So I can't meet Brian at 10:00 AM and Carol at 10:15 AM because Brian's meeting ends at 9:30 PM, but I need to leave for Carol at 10:15 AM. Maybe it's better to meet Brian later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Brian after other meetings. Let me see:\n\n- Meet **Brian** at 2:00 PM. That gives 75 minutes until 3:15 PM. Then, I can go to **Kenneth** at The Castro from 3:15 PM to 3:45 PM. Then to **Laura** at Mission District from 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM, then to **Kimberly** at Richmond District from 5:05 PM to 5:35 PM, then to **Linda** at Marina District from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM, then to **Karen** at Russian Hill from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM, and finally to **Paul** at Alamo Square from 8:15 PM to 9:15 PM, and then back to Pacific Heights.\n\nWait, but that might be too late for some meetings. Let me check the travel times:\n\n- Pacific Heights to Presidio: 11 minutes. If I leave at 2:00 PM, I arrive at 2:11 PM. Meet Brian until 3:15 PM. Then travel to The Castro: 22 minutes, arriving at 3:37 PM. Meet Kenneth until 3:37 PM to 4:07 PM. Then to Mission District: 17 minutes, arriving at 4:14 PM. Meet Laura until 4:14 PM to 4:44 PM. Then to Richmond District: 20 minutes, arriving at 5:04 PM. Meet Kimberly until 5:04 PM to 5:34 PM. Then to Marina District: 9 minutes, arriving at 5:13 PM. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to recalculate.\n\nThis is getting complicated. I think I need to prioritize the meetings based on the earliest possible times and the required durations to ensure everyone gets their minimum meeting time without overlapping. Maybe starting with the latest possible meetings first would help, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can combine some meetings or find overlapping times where multiple people are available. For example, **Kenneth** and **Laura** are both available from 2:45 PM to 4:15 PM and 4:15 PM to 8:30 PM, respectively. Maybe I can meet them back-to-back without much waiting.\n\nI think I need to create a timeline that fits all these meetings with the required durations and travel times, ensuring I don't double-book and respect everyone's availability. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to map it out step by step, considering the travel distances and ensuring each meeting starts and ends within the person's available window.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"person\": \"Carol\", \"start_time\": \"10:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Presidio\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"14:00\", \"end_time\": \"15:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"The Castro\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Mission District\", \"person\": \"Laura\", \"start_time\": \"16:15\", \"end_time\": \"16:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Richmond District\", \"person\": \"Kimberly\", \"start_time\": \"17:00\", \"end_time\": \"17:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"Linda\", \"start_time\": \"18:00\", \"end_time\": \"18:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Russian Hill\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"18:45\", \"end_time\": \"19:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Paul\", \"start_time\": \"19:30\", \"end_time\": \"19:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Nob Hill\", \"person\": \"Sandra\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"20:60\"}\n  ]\n}",

Meeting Brian from 9:15 PM to 9:50 PM gives 35 minutes, which is more than the required 75 minutes, but I can adjust the time if needed.\n\nWait, but Brian needs 75 minutes. I only gave 35 minutes. That's a problem. I need to adjust the schedule to ensure each meeting meets the minimum time requirement.\n\nLet me go back. Maybe I can combine some meetings or adjust the order to accommodate Brian's longer meeting. Perhaps meeting Brian earlier would help. Let's try:\n\n- **Brian** at Presidio from 10:00 AM to 9:30 PM. If I meet him at 10:00 AM, that's 75 minutes. But Carol is at Financial District until 12:00 PM. So I can't meet Brian at 10:00 AM and Carol at 10:15 AM because Brian's meeting ends at 9:30 PM, but I need to leave for Carol at 10:15 AM. Maybe it's better to meet Brian later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Brian after other meetings. Let me see:\n\n- Meet **Brian** at 2:00 PM. That gives 75 minutes until 3:15 PM. Then, I can go to **Kenneth** at The Castro from 3:15 PM to 3:45 PM. Then to **Laura** at Mission District from 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM, then to **Kimberly** at Richmond District from 5:05 PM to 5:35 PM, then to **Linda** at Marina District from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM, then to **Karen** at Russian Hill from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM, and finally to **Paul** at Alamo Square from 8:15 PM to 9:15 PM, and then back to Pacific Heights.\n\nWait, but that might be too late for some meetings. Let me check the travel times:\n\n- Pacific Heights to Presidio: 11 minutes. If I leave at 2:00 PM, I arrive at 2:11 PM. Meet Brian until 3:15 PM. Then travel to The Castro: 22 minutes, arriving at 3:37 PM. Meet Kenneth until 3:37 PM to 4:07 PM. Then to Mission District: 17 minutes, arriving at 4:14 PM. Meet Laura until 4:14 PM to 4:44 PM. Then to Richmond District: 20 minutes, arriving at 5:04 PM. Meet Kimberly until 5:04 PM to 5:34 PM. Then to Marina District: 9 minutes, arriving at 5:13 PM. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to recalculate.\n\nThis is getting complicated. I think I need to prioritize the meetings based on the earliest possible times and the required durations to ensure everyone gets their minimum meeting time without overlapping. Maybe starting with the latest possible meetings first would help, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can combine some meetings or find overlapping times where multiple people are available. For example, **Kenneth** and **Laura** are both available from 2:45 PM to 4:15 PM and 4:15 PM to 8:30 PM, respectively. Maybe I can meet them back-to-back without much waiting.\n\nI think I need to create a timeline that fits all these meetings with the required durations and travel times, ensuring I don't double-book and respect everyone's availability. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to map it out step by step, considering the travel distances and ensuring each meeting starts and ends within the person's available window.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:"
