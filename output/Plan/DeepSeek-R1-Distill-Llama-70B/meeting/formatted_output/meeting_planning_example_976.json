            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to schedule my day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible. I arrive at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, and I need to meet several people spread out across the city. Each person has specific time windows when they're available, and I need to make sure I can meet them for the required minimum time. Plus, I have to consider travel times between locations to make sure I'm not wasting too much time moving around.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out all the people I need to meet and their availability:\n\n1. **Matthew**: Bayview from 7:15 PM to 10:00 PM. I need at least 120 minutes with him.\n2. **Karen**: Chinatown from 7:15 PM to 9:15 PM. Need 90 minutes.\n3. **Sarah**: Alamo Square from 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM. Need 105 minutes.\n4. **Jessica**: Nob Hill from 4:30 PM to 6:45 PM. Need 120 minutes.\n5. **Stephanie**: Presidio from 7:30 AM to 10:15 AM. Need 60 minutes.\n6. **Mary**: Union Square from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM. Need 60 minutes.\n7. **Charles**: The Castro from 4:30 PM to 10:00 PM. Need 105 minutes.\n8. **Nancy**: North Beach from 2:45 PM to 8:00 PM. Need 15 minutes.\n9. **Thomas**: Fisherman's Wharf from 1:30 PM to 7:00 PM. Need 30 minutes.\n10. **Brian**: Marina District from 12:15 PM to 6:00 PM. Need 60 minutes.\n\nLooking at the time windows, I notice that some people are available in the early evening, while others are available later in the day. I need to find a way to fit these meetings without overlapping too much and considering the travel times between locations.\n\nStarting with the earliest possible meeting, **Stephanie** is at Presidio from 7:30 AM to 10:15 AM. Since I arrive at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, I can meet her somewhere near Presidio. The travel time from Embarcadero to Presidio is 20 minutes. If I leave Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, I can arrive at Presidio by 9:20 AM. Her availability starts at 7:30 AM, but I can meet her any time during her window. To maximize my day, I should meet her as early as possible to leave room for other meetings.\n\nAfter meeting Stephanie, I need to decide where to go next. Presidio is a good central location, but I have several other meetings in the afternoon and evening. I should plan the next meeting in a location that's convenient for travel.\n\nNext, **Brian** is at Marina District from 12:15 PM to 6:00 PM. Marina District is close to Embarcadero, so I can go there after meeting Stephanie. The travel time from Presidio to Marina District is 10 minutes. If I leave Presidio at around 10:15 AM, I can arrive at Marina District by 10:25 AM. But Brian isn't available until 12:15 PM, so I have some time to kill. Maybe I can go to another nearby location or just wait in Marina District.\n\nWait, but if I leave Presidio at 10:15 AM, I can go to another location, but I need to ensure I don't miss the chance to meet Brian. Alternatively, I can stay in Marina District and wait until 12:15 PM to meet Brian. That might be better to avoid back-and-forth travel.\n\nAfter meeting Brian, I need to consider the next meeting. **Nancy** is at North Beach from 2:45 PM to 8:00 PM. North Beach is a bit further away, so I need to plan the travel time. The travel time from Marina District to North Beach is 9 minutes. If I leave Marina District at 1:15 PM, I can arrive at North Beach by 1:24 PM. Nancy is available from 2:45 PM, so I can wait until then.\n\nOnce I meet Nancy, who only needs 15 minutes, I can move on to the next meeting. **Thomas** is at Fisherman's Wharf from 1:30 PM to 7:00 PM. Fisherman's Wharf is near North Beach, so the travel time is minimal. If I leave North Beach at 2:45 PM, I can arrive at Fisherman's Wharf by 2:50 PM, which fits within Thomas's availability window.\n\nAfter meeting Thomas, I need to decide where to go next. **Charles** is at The Castro from 4:30 PM to 10:00 PM. The Castro is a bit further away, so I need to plan the travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to The Castro, which is 27 minutes. If I leave Fisherman's Wharf at 3:30 PM, I can arrive at The Castro by 3:57 PM, which is before Charles's availability starts at 4:30 PM. I can wait until 4:30 PM to meet him.\n\nOnce I meet Charles, who needs 105 minutes, I can plan the next meeting. **Jessica** is at Nob Hill from 4:30 PM to 6:45 PM. The travel time from The Castro to Nob Hill is 17 minutes. If I leave The Castro at 5:00 PM, I can arrive at Nob Hill by 5:17 PM, fitting within Jessica's availability.\n\nAfter meeting Jessica, who needs 120 minutes, I can go to **Sarah** at Alamo Square from 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM. The travel time from Nob Hill to Alamo Square is 11 minutes. If I leave Nob Hill at 6:45 PM, I can arrive at Alamo Square by 6:56 PM, but Sarah isn't available until 8:00 PM. I can wait in Alamo Square until 8:00 PM.\n\nOnce I meet Sarah, I can proceed to **Karen** at Chinatown from 7:15 PM to 9:15 PM. The travel time from Alamo Square to Chinatown is 15 minutes. If I leave Alamo Square at 9:45 PM, I can arrive at Chinatown by 10:00 PM, fitting within Karen's availability.\n\nFinally, I need to meet **Matthew** at Bayview from 7:15 PM to 10:00 PM. The travel time from Chinatown to Bayview is 20 minutes. If I leave Chinatown at 9:45 PM, I can arrive at Bayview by 10:05 PM, which is within Matthew's availability.\n\nI also need to consider **Mary** at Union Square from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM. However, I might not have time to meet her after meeting Jessica because of the travel time and the required 60 minutes. Similarly, **Stephanie** is already met early in the day.\n\nWait, did I miss **Mary**? She is at Union Square from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM. I need to see if I can fit her in. If I meet her after meeting Jessica, I would need to travel from Nob Hill to Union Square, which is 7 minutes. If I leave Nob Hill at 6:45 PM, I can arrive at Union Square by 6:52 PM, but Mary isn't available until 4:45 PM. I can't meet her earlier because I'm meeting Jessica until 6:45 PM. Maybe I need to adjust the schedule to meet Mary earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Mary after meeting someone else. Let me see. If I meet Mary at 4:45 PM, I need to be at Union Square. But I might be tied up with other meetings around that time. It might be challenging to fit her in without overlapping.\n\nSimilarly, **Brian** is at Marina District from 12:15 PM to 6:00 PM. I need to make sure I meet him without conflicting with other meetings.\n\nI think the current plan covers most of the key meetings, but I might need to adjust to include Mary and Brian. Maybe I can meet Brian earlier in the day and Mary later, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the order of meetings to accommodate everyone. It's a bit complex, but I think the initial plan covers the majority of the required meetings with the given constraints.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Presidio\", \"person\": \"Stephanie\", \"start_time\": \"9:00\", \"end_time\": \"9:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"12:15\", \"end_time\": \"1:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Nancy\", \"start_time\": \"2:45\", \"end_time\": \"3:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"Thomas\", \"start_time\": \"3:00\", \"end_time\": \"3:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"The Castro\", \"person\": \"Charles\", \"start_time\": \"4:30\", \"end_time\": \"5:35\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Nob Hill\", \"person\": \"Jessica\", \"start_time\": \"5:40\", \"end_time\": \"6:40\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Sarah\", \"start_time\": \"8:00\", \"end_time\": \"9:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"9:15\", \"end_time\": \"10:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Bayview\", \"person\": \"Matthew\", \"start_time\": \"10:00\", \"end_time\": \"11:00\"}\n  ]\n}",
