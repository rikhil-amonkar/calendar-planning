            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to help this AI planner figure out a meeting schedule for the day. The user provided a lot of travel distances and constraints, and I need to come up with a plan that allows the user to meet as many friends as possible without backtracking too much, considering the time constraints.\n\nFirst, I look at the constraints. The user starts at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM. Helen is at North Beach from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. So, the earliest I can meet Helen is at 9:00 AM, but since she's already there, maybe I can meet her right when I arrive.\n\nNext, Betty is at Financial District from 7:00 PM to 9:45 PM. That's a bit later in the day, but it's manageable. Amanda is at Alamo Square from 7:45 PM to 9:00 PM, so that's also in the evening. Kevin is at Mission District from 10:45 AM to 2:45 PM, which is mid-morning to early afternoon.\n\nI need to figure out a route that connects all these locations efficiently. Starting at Pacific Heights, I can go to North Beach, which is only 8 minutes away. That makes sense because Helen is already there, so I can meet her first.\n\nFrom North Beach, I can head to Financial District, which is 7 minutes away. That's where Betty is, but she's only there from 7:00 PM to 9:45 PM. Since I'm starting at 9:00 AM, I'll have to wait until 7:00 PM to meet her. That's a long wait, but it's doable.\n\nAfter Financial District, I can go to Alamo Square, which is 17 minutes away. Amanda is there from 7:45 PM to 9:00 PM. I'll have to time this meeting right when she arrives or before she leaves. Maybe around 8:30 PM.\n\nFrom Alamo Square, the next stop is Mission District, which is 11 minutes away. Kevin is there from 10:45 AM to 2:45 PM. I need to meet him before he leaves, so I'll schedule this for around 12:00 PM.\n\nFinally, from Mission District, I can return to Pacific Heights, but that's 15 minutes. However, considering the time, it might be better to end the day after meeting Kevin.\n\nI need to make sure the travel times add up and that I'm not double-backtracking too much. Let me check the distances again to ensure each leg is feasible.\n\nStarting at Pacific Heights:\n- North Beach: 9 minutes\n- Financial District: 7 minutes\n- Alamo Square: 17 minutes\n- Mission District: 11 minutes\n\nWait, that seems a bit much for one day. Maybe I should adjust the order or find a more efficient path. Alternatively, I can adjust the meeting times with the constraints in mind.\n\nPerhaps I can meet Helen at North Beach first, then move to Financial District to meet Betty, then to Alamo Square to meet Amanda, and then to Mission District to meet Kevin. That way, I cover all the required meetings without too much backtracking.\n\nI also need to ensure that I'm not exceeding the minimum meeting times. For example, meeting Helen for 15 minutes, Betty for 90 minutes, Amanda for 60 minutes, and Kevin for 45 minutes.\n\nConsidering all this, the itinerary would look something like:\n\n1. Meet Helen at North Beach at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Financial District to meet Betty from 7:00 PM to 9:45 PM.\n3. Travel to Alamo Square to meet Amanda from 7:45 PM to 9:00 PM.\n4. Travel to Mission District to meet Kevin from 10:45 AM to 2:45 PM.\n\nI need to make sure the travel times between these locations are feasible and that I can move from one place to another without spending too much time traveling, especially since some meetings are in the evening.\n\nWait, the travel from Alamo Square to Mission District is 11 minutes, and Kevin is there from 10:45 AM to 2:45 PM. If I leave Alamo Square around 8:30 PM, I can meet Amanda, then travel to Mission District to meet Kevin, but that would require staying late, which might not be ideal.\n\nMaybe I should adjust the order to meet Kevin earlier. Let me see: after meeting Helen, go to Mission District to meet Kevin, then proceed to Financial District and Alamo Square. But the travel times need to be considered.\n\nAlternatively, I can meet Kevin first, then proceed to the other locations. However, Kevin's availability is from 10:45 AM to 2:45 PM, so meeting him later in the morning might be more efficient.\n\nI think the best approach is to start at Pacific Heights, go to North Beach to meet Helen, then to Financial District to meet Betty, then to Alamo Square to meet Amanda, and finally to Mission District to meet Kevin. This way, I cover all the required meetings in one day without too much backtracking.\n\nI need to make sure the travel times add up correctly and that I don't have any overlaps or conflicts. Also, I should consider the waiting times for the evening meetings.\n\nOverall, the plan seems feasible, but I need to double-check the travel distances and ensure that the meeting times fit within the available windows. It's a bit tight, but with careful planning, it should work out.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Amanda\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
