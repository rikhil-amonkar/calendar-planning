            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an AI meeting planner. They want to schedule a day of meetings in San Francisco, starting from Sunset District at 9:00AM. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible while considering travel times and constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the travel distances provided. Sunset District has connections to Chinatown, Russian Hill, North Beach, and others. The user provided specific distances between these locations, so I should refer to those to plan the best routes.\n\nLooking at the constraints, the user arrives at Sunset District at 9:00AM. There are two main people to meet: Anthony in Chinatown from 1:15PM to 2:30PM, and Rebecca in Russian Hill from 7:30PM to 9:15PM. The user wants to meet each for a minimum of 60 and 105 minutes, respectively.\n\nThe third person is Melissa in North Beach, available from 8:15AM to 1:30PM, also requiring a 105-minute meeting. So, there are three meetings to schedule.\n\nI need to plan the itinerary starting from Sunset District. The first thought is to meet Melissa in North Beach since she's available early, which might allow more flexibility for the other meetings. Sunset District to North Beach is 29 minutes, which is manageable.\n\nAfter meeting Melissa, the next earliest available time would be around 10:15AM. The next meeting could be with Anthony in Chinatown. The distance from North Beach to Chinatown is 3 minutes, which is quick. Meeting Anthony for 60 minutes would end at 11:15AM.\n\nFrom there, the next available time is around 11:30AM. The next meeting is with Rebecca in Russian Hill. The distance from Chinatown to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. Meeting Rebecca for 105 minutes would end at 12:45PM.\n\nHowever, considering the travel time from Russian Hill back to Sunset District for the next meeting, it might be better to adjust the order. Alternatively, maybe it's better to meet Rebecca last to maximize the time in the evening when she's available.\n\nWait, but the user needs to return to Sunset District after each meeting. So, after meeting Rebecca at 12:45PM, it would take 24 minutes to return to Sunset District, ending at 1:09PM. That might be too late to meet Anthony, who is only available until 2:30PM, but the user needs at least 60 minutes. So, perhaps meeting Anthony first is better.\n\nLet me try a different order. Start with Sunset District to North Beach to meet Melissa from 9:00 to 10:15AM. Then go to Chinatown to meet Anthony from 10:15 to 11:15AM. Then to Russian Hill to meet Rebecca from 11:15 to 12:45PM. After that, return to Sunset District, which would take 24 minutes, ending at 1:09PM. This leaves the rest of the day free.\n\nBut the user might prefer to meet Rebecca last since she has a longer availability window in the evening. So, let's adjust. Meet Melissa first, then Anthony, then Rebecca. After meeting Rebecca, return to Sunset District, which ends the day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to meet Rebecca earlier if possible, but her availability starts at 7:30PM, which is too late if the user wants to meet her first. So, it's logical to meet her last.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. 9:00AM - Meet Melissa in North Beach until 10:15AM.\n2. 10:15AM - Travel to Chinatown to meet Anthony until 11:15AM.\n3. 11:15AM - Travel to Russian Hill to meet Rebecca until 12:45PM.\n4. 12:45PM - Return to Sunset District, ending the day.\n\nThis way, all three meetings are scheduled with the required minimum times, and the user maximizes their day by meeting as many friends as possible.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Anthony\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
