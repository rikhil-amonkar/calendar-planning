            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help this AI planning tool figure out the best meeting schedule for the day. The user has given a bunch of travel distances between different locations in San Francisco and some constraints about when certain people will be available. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings while considering the travel times and making sure each meeting is long enough as per the constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The user arrives at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. There are several people with specific time slots available at various locations. The task is to schedule meetings in such a way that the user can meet as many people as possible without backtracking too much, considering the travel distances provided.\n\nLooking at the constraints, the first thing I notice is that Kenneth is at Richmond District from 9:15 PM to 10:00 PM. Since the user arrives at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, they have a few hours before Kenneth becomes available. Maybe the user can do some meetings in the morning before Kenneth's time slot.\n\nNext, Lisa is at Union Square from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM. That's a long window, so the user can definitely meet her. Joshua is at Financial District from 12:00 PM to 3:15 PM. That's a couple of hours, so the user can meet him in the afternoon. Nancy is at Pacific Heights from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM. That's early in the morning, so the user should prioritize meeting her if possible.\n\nAndrew is at Nob Hill from 11:30 AM to 8:15 PM. That's a long window, but the user needs to plan travel to Nob Hill. John is at Bayview from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM. That's late in the day, so maybe the user can meet him in the evening after other meetings.\n\nNow, looking at the travel distances, the user needs to go from Embarcadero to different locations. The distances provided help estimate how long it would take to travel between locations. The user wants to minimize travel time to optimize the schedule.\n\nI think the best approach is to start with the earliest available meetings and then move to later ones, ensuring that travel times are manageable. For example, meeting Nancy at Pacific Heights early might be a good start since she's available until 11:30 AM.\n\nAfter that, the user can head to Union Square to meet Lisa, which is a short travel distance from Pacific Heights. Then, from Union Square, the user can go to Financial District to meet Joshua. From there, moving to Nob Hill to meet Andrew makes sense since it's not too far from Financial District.\n\nIn the evening, the user can go to Bayview to meet John, which is a bit of a longer trip, but manageable within the time constraints.\n\nI also need to consider the travel times between these locations. For example, from Embarcadero to Pacific Heights is 11 minutes, which is quick. From Pacific Heights to Union Square is 15 minutes, which is also manageable. From Union Square to Financial District is 9 minutes, and then to Nob Hill is 14 minutes. Finally, from Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 minutes.\n\nThis seems like a logical sequence to maximize the number of meetings without too much backtracking. Each meeting is within the user's available time and the travel times are reasonable.\n\nSo, the proposed schedule would be:\n\n1. Meet Nancy at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Union Square to meet Lisa around 10:15 AM.\n3. Then go to Financial District to meet Joshua at 12:00 PM.\n4. After that, head to Nob Hill to meet Andrew around 1:30 PM.\n5. Finally, travel to Bayview to meet John at 5:00 PM.\n\nThis way, the user can meet all five people without exceeding the travel time limits and respecting the constraints of each person's availability.\n\nI think this makes sense. It covers all the necessary meetings in a logical order, minimizing travel time and ensuring that each meeting is within the required time slots.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Lisa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Nob Hill\",\n      \"person\": \"Andrew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"person\": \"John\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
