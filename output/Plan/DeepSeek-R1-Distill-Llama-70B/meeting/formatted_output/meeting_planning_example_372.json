            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to help this AI planning tool come up with a meeting schedule for someone visiting San Francisco. They want to meet as many friends as possible, so I need to consider the travel times and constraints to make sure everything is optimized.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The user has provided a bunch of travel distances between different locations in San Francisco. They've also given specific constraints about when each person is available. My task is to create an itinerary that allows the visitor to meet as many people as possible without exceeding the travel time constraints.\n\nLooking at the latest problem, the visitor arrives at Sunset District at 9:00AM. There are four people to meet: Sarah, Jeffrey, Brian, and Charles, each with their own time slots. I need to figure out the best times and locations to meet them, considering the travel distances provided.\n\nStarting with Sarah, who's at North Beach from 4:00PM to 6:15PM. That's in the afternoon, so I need to plan a meeting that fits within that window. Then there's Jeffrey at Union Square from 3:00PM to 10:00PM, which gives a bit more flexibility. Brian is at Alamo Square from 4:00PM to 5:30PM, and Charles is at Alamo Square from 6:00PM to 8:45PM.\n\nI need to make sure that the visitor can move between locations efficiently, considering the travel times. For example, if the visitor meets Sarah at North Beach in the afternoon, they might need to travel from Sunset District to North Beach, which takes 27 minutes according to the distance data. Then, from North Beach to Union Square, which is 7 minutes, and then to Alamo Square, which is 15 minutes. That seems manageable.\n\nFor Jeffrey, who's at Union Square later in the day, maybe the visitor can go from Alamo Square to Union Square, which is 14 minutes. That fits well within the schedule.\n\nBrian is at Alamo Square from 4:00PM to 5:30PM, so if the visitor meets him after meeting Sarah, that could work. From North Beach to Alamo Square is 15 minutes, which is quick.\n\nCharles is at Alamo Square from 6:00PM to 8:45PM, so the visitor can meet him after Brian. From Alamo Square back to Sunset District would take 16 minutes, which is reasonable.\n\nI also need to consider that the visitor arrives at 9:00AM and needs to start their day. Maybe the first meeting could be with someone closer to Sunset District. Looking at the options, Brian is at Alamo Square from 4:00PM, which is a bit later, but perhaps the visitor can start with Jeffrey at Union Square, which is only 30 minutes from Sunset District.\n\nWait, but Jeffrey is from 3:00PM, so if the visitor starts their day at 9:00AM, they have time to go to Union Square at 3:00PM. From Sunset District to Union Square is 30 minutes, which is feasible.\n\nThen, from Union Square, the visitor can go to North Beach to meet Sarah, which is 7 minutes. After that, to Alamo Square to meet Brian, which is 15 minutes. Then, from Alamo Square to Sunset District for Charles, which is 16 minutes.\n\nThis seems like a logical sequence. Let me outline the timeline:\n\n1. Start at Sunset District at 9:00AM.\n2. Travel to Union Square by 3:00PM to meet Jeffrey.\n3. After meeting Jeffrey, go to North Beach by 4:00PM to meet Sarah.\n4. Then, travel to Alamo Square by 4:00PM to meet Brian.\n5. Finally, travel back to Sunset District by 6:00PM to meet Charles.\n\nThis way, the visitor meets all four friends within their available time slots without exceeding travel time constraints.\n\nI should also check if the travel times between these locations are feasible. For example, from Sunset District to Union Square is 30 minutes, Union Square to North Beach is 10 minutes, North Beach to Alamo Square is 15 minutes, and Alamo Square back to Sunset District is 16 minutes. All these travel times are within the provided distances, so the itinerary should work smoothly.\n\nI think this plan optimizes the schedule by maximizing the use of the visitor's time, ensuring they can meet as many friends as possible without getting bogged down by travel. It also respects the constraints of each person's availability.\n\nSo, the final itinerary would involve visiting Union Square first, then North Beach, Alamo Square, and finally returning to Sunset District to meet Charles. This sequence should allow the visitor to meet all four friends efficiently.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Sunset District\",\n      \"person\": \"Charles\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
