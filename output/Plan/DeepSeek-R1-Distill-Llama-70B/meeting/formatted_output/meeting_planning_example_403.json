            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help schedule a day of meetings for someone visiting San Francisco. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and the constraints provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the constraints. The person arrives at Union Square at 9:00 AM. They have several friends in different locations with specific time windows. Each meeting requires a minimum duration, so I need to ensure that the meetings are long enough and that travel times between meetings are manageable.\n\nI'll start by listing all the people and their available times:\n\n1. **Andrew** at Golden Gate Park from 11:45 AM to 2:30 PM. Need 75 minutes.\n2. **Sarah** at Pacific Heights from 4:15 PM to 6:45 PM. Need 15 minutes.\n3. **Nancy** at Presidio from 5:30 PM to 7:15 PM. Need 60 minutes.\n4. **Rebecca** at Chinatown from 9:45 AM to 9:30 PM. Need 90 minutes.\n5. **Robert** at The Castro from 8:30 AM to 2:15 PM. Need 30 minutes.\n\nI need to start at Union Square at 9:00 AM. The first thing is to figure out who can be met earliest. Rebecca is available from 9:45 AM, which gives me a bit of flexibility.\n\nI should also consider the travel times between locations. For example, from Union Square to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes, which is manageable. From there to Pacific Heights is another 15 minutes, and so on.\n\nLet me try to fit in Rebecca first. If I meet Rebecca at 9:45 AM, that gives me 45 minutes, which is less than the required 90 minutes. So maybe I should aim for a later time. Alternatively, perhaps I can meet someone else earlier.\n\nLooking at Robert, he's available from 8:30 AM, but I can't meet him before 9:00 AM. Maybe I can meet him at The Castro at 9:00 AM. The travel time from Union Square to The Castro is 19 minutes, which is doable.\n\nSo, meeting Robert at The Castro from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM. That fits his availability and gives me a 30-minute meeting, which is sufficient.\n\nNext, Rebecca is available from 9:45 AM. If I meet her at 9:45 AM, that's a 15-minute meeting, but I need at least 90 minutes. So perhaps I can extend the meeting. Alternatively, maybe I can meet her later.\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize the longer meetings first. Rebecca needs 90 minutes, so it's better to schedule her earlier to ensure there's enough time for other meetings.\n\nLet me try to meet Rebecca at 10:00 AM. That would leave me 90 minutes, which is perfect. Then, I can travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Andrew, who is available from 11:45 AM.\n\nFrom Chinatown to Golden Gate Park, the travel time is 23 minutes. So, if I leave Chinatown at 10:30 AM, I can arrive at Golden Gate Park at 10:53 AM. But Andrew isn't available until 11:45 AM. So perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Rebecca, I can go to Golden Gate Park to meet Andrew. The travel time from Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes. If I leave Chinatown at 10:30 AM, I'll arrive at 10:53 AM. But Andrew isn't available until 11:45 AM. So maybe I can leave a bit later.\n\nWait, perhaps I should meet Andrew after Rebecca. Let's see:\n\n- Meet Rebecca at Chinatown from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM.\n- Then travel to Golden Gate Park, arriving at 10:53 AM. But Andrew isn't available until 11:45 AM, so I can wait there until 11:45 AM.\n- Meet Andrew from 11:45 AM to 12:45 PM. That gives me 75 minutes, which is enough.\n\nAfter that, I can go to Pacific Heights to meet Sarah. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Pacific Heights is 16 minutes. Sarah is available from 4:15 PM to 6:45 PM. If I meet Andrew at 12:45 PM, I can travel to Pacific Heights and maybe do something else in the afternoon.\n\nBut I also need to meet Nancy at Presidio from 5:30 PM to 7:15 PM. Let's see how that fits in.\n\nAfter meeting Andrew, I can go to Presidio. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Presidio is 11 minutes. If I leave Golden Gate Park at 12:45 PM, I'll arrive at Presidio at 12:56 PM. But Nancy isn't available until 5:30 PM. So I need to come back later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can meet Nancy after meeting Sarah. Let's see:\n\n- After meeting Andrew at 12:45 PM, I can go to Pacific Heights to meet Sarah from 1:00 PM to 1:15 PM. That's a 15-minute meeting, which is sufficient.\n- Then, I can travel to Presidio, arriving at 1:15 PM. But Nancy isn't available until 5:30 PM, so I can come back later.\n\nWait, maybe I can meet Nancy earlier. Let me check the travel time from Presidio to Union Square. It's 22 minutes. If I leave Presidio at 5:30 PM, I can arrive at Union Square by 5:52 PM. But I need to make sure I have enough time for other meetings.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should outline a possible itinerary step by step, ensuring that each meeting fits within the time constraints and travel times.\n\nLet me try this plan:\n\n1. **9:00 AM - 9:30 AM**: Meet Robert at The Castro. Travel time from Union Square to The Castro is 19 minutes. This fits Robert's availability and gives a 30-minute meeting.\n\n2. **9:45 AM - 10:45 AM**: Meet Rebecca at Chinatown. Travel time from The Castro to Chinatown is 19 minutes. This gives a 90-minute meeting, which is sufficient.\n\n3. **11:00 AM - 11:45 AM**: Travel from Chinatown to Golden Gate Park (23 minutes). Arrive at 11:23 AM. Wait until 11:45 AM to meet Andrew for 75 minutes.\n\n4. **12:45 PM - 1:15 PM**: Travel from Golden Gate Park to Pacific Heights (16 minutes). Meet Sarah for 15 minutes.\n\n5. **1:30 PM - 2:15 PM**: Travel from Pacific Heights to Presidio (11 minutes). Meet Nancy for 60 minutes.\n\n6. **3:15 PM - 3:45 PM**: Travel from Presidio back to Union Square (22 minutes). Arrive by 3:37 PM.\n\n7. **4:15 PM - 6:45 PM**: Travel from Union Square to Pacific Heights (15 minutes). Meet Sarah again if possible, but she's already been met.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to adjust the schedule to include all necessary meetings without overlapping.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to prioritize the longest meetings first and ensure that travel times are accounted for.\n\nLet me try another approach:\n\n1. **9:00 AM - 9:30 AM**: Meet Robert at The Castro.\n\n2. **9:30 AM - 10:30 AM**: Travel from The Castro to Chinatown (19 minutes). Meet Rebecca for 90 minutes.\n\n3. **11:00 AM - 12:00 PM**: Travel from Chinatown to Golden Gate Park (23 minutes). Meet Andrew for 75 minutes.\n\n4. **12:30 PM - 1:30 PM**: Travel from Golden Gate Park to Pacific Heights (16 minutes). Meet Sarah for 15 minutes.\n\n5. **2:00 PM - 3:00 PM**: Travel from Pacific Heights to Presidio (11 minutes). Meet Nancy for 60 minutes.\n\n6. **4:00 PM - 5:00 PM**: Travel from Presidio back to Union Square (22 minutes). Arrive by 4:22 PM.\n\n7. **5:30 PM - 7:15 PM**: Travel from Union Square to Presidio (24 minutes). Meet Nancy again if possible, but she's already been met.\n\nThis still doesn't cover all meetings without conflicts. Maybe I need to adjust the order or find alternative locations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can combine some meetings or find overlapping times more effectively.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\n- Meet Rebecca at Chinatown from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM.\n- Then, go to Golden Gate Park to meet Andrew from 11:45 AM to 12:45 PM.\n- After that, go to Pacific Heights to meet Sarah from 1:00 PM to 1:15 PM.\n- Then, go to Presidio to meet Nancy from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM.\n- Finally, return to Union Square and go to The Castro to meet Robert from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n\nThis way, I'm able to meet all the required friends without overlapping meetings, considering the travel times.\n\nI think this plan works. Now, I'll outline the itinerary accordingly.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"The Castro\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"9:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"person\": \"Andrew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Presidio\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"2:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"3:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
