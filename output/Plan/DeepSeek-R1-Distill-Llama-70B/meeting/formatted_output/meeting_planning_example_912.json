            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to help this person who's in San Francisco for the day and wants to meet as many friends as possible. They arrive at Union Square at 9:00 AM and have to schedule meetings considering the travel times and the friends' availability. Each friend has specific time windows and locations where they can meet, and each meeting requires a certain minimum time. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping, considering the travel times from Union Square to each location and back.\n\nFirst, I need to list out all the friends and their meeting details:\n\n- Kimberly at Presidio from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n- Elizabeth at Alamo Square from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n- Joshua at Marina District from 10:30 AM to 2:15 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n- Sandra at Financial District from 7:30 PM to 8:15 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n- Kenneth at Nob Hill from 12:45 PM to 9:45 PM, needs 30 minutes.\n- Betty at Sunset District from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM, needs 60 minutes.\n- Deborah at Chinatown from 5:15 PM to 8:30 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n- Barbara at Russian Hill from 5:30 PM to 9:15 PM, needs 120 minutes.\n- Steven at North Beach from 5:45 PM to 8:45 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n- Daniel at Haight-Ashbury from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n\nNow, the person starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM. So the first thing is to figure out who can be met earliest in the day. Joshua is available from 10:30 AM at Marina District. The travel time from Union Square to Marina District is 18 minutes, so they can arrive there by 10:30 AM. The meeting needs 45 minutes, so they can leave at 11:15 AM. That seems doable.\n\nNext, after meeting Joshua, the person can head to another location. Let's see who's available after 11:15 AM. Kenneth is at Nob Hill until 9:45 PM, so that's possible. The travel time to Nob Hill is 9 minutes, so they can get there by 11:24 AM. They need 30 minutes, so the meeting would end at 11:54 AM. That works, but they might want to check if there's a better option.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua, maybe meeting someone else earlier. Let's see. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, but that's later, so maybe not the best option to do early. Deborah is at Chinatown from 5:15 PM, which is later. Same with others.\n\nWait, but let's think about the travel times. After meeting Joshua at Marina District, maybe the next best option is to go to Presidio to meet Kimberly. The travel time is 22 minutes, so they can arrive at Presidio by 10:30 AM + 18 minutes (Marina) + 22 minutes (Presidio) = 11:52 AM. But Kimberly is only available from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So that might not work because the person would arrive too early. So maybe better to meet Kimberly later.\n\nSo after Joshua, maybe the next best is to go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. The travel time from Marina District to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So if they leave Marina District at 11:15 AM, they can arrive at Alamo Square by 11:30 AM. But Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM. So that's way too early. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Joshua, perhaps go to another location. Let's check the times. Maybe after Joshua, go to Financial District for Sandra, but Sandra is available from 7:30 PM, which is too late.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to meet someone who can be reached quickly after Joshua and has a later availability. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua, maybe go to Chinatown for Deborah. Travel time from Marina District to Chinatown is 15 minutes. So they can leave Marina District at 11:15 AM, arrive at Chinatown at 11:30 AM. Deborah is available from 5:15 PM, so that's too early. Not possible.\n\nSimilarly, North Beach is 11 minutes from Marina District. Steven is at North Beach from 5:45 PM, so too early.\n\nHaight-Ashbury is 16 minutes from Marina District. Daniel is there from 6:30 PM, so still too early.\n\nSo after Joshua, maybe it's better to go to a place where the next meeting can be scheduled later. Let's consider meeting someone else.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of meeting Joshua first, maybe meet someone else earlier. Let me check who else is available in the morning.\n\nLooking at the times, Joshua starts at 10:30 AM, which is the earliest. So maybe that's the first meeting.\n\nAfter Joshua, the next possible friend is Betty at Sunset District from 2:00 PM. The travel time from Marina District to Sunset District is 21 minutes. So they can leave Marina District at 11:15 AM, arrive at Sunset District by 11:36 AM. But Betty is only available from 2:00 PM. So that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua, maybe go to Presidio to meet Kimberly. But as I thought earlier, Kimberly is only available from 3:30 PM. So the person would have to wait at Presidio from 10:30 AM until 3:30 PM, which is 5 hours. That's a long wait, but possible.\n\nBut the problem is that the person needs to move efficiently. Maybe better to meet someone else after Joshua.\n\nWait, let's see the times again. After meeting Joshua until 11:15 AM, the next possible meeting could be with Kenneth at Nob Hill, which is 9 minutes from Union Square. So if they leave Marina District at 11:15 AM, travel time is 21 minutes, so arrive at Sunset District at 11:36 AM. But Betty is only available from 2:00 PM, so that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua, maybe go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth, but she's only available in the evening.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to meet Joshua first, then go to Presidio to meet Kimberly, but that would require waiting a long time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet someone else in the morning.\n\nWait, let's check the travel times from Union Square:\n\n- Joshua: 18 minutes to Marina District.\n- Kenneth: 9 minutes to Nob Hill.\n- Deborah: 7 minutes to Chinatown.\n- Steven: 11 minutes to North Beach.\n- Daniel: 18 minutes to Haight-Ashbury.\n\nSo after Joshua, perhaps go to Chinatown for Deborah. The travel time from Marina District to Chinatown is 15 minutes. So leaving at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:30 AM. But Deborah is only available from 5:15 PM, so that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time 11 minutes from Marina District. Arrive at 11:26 AM. Steven is available from 5:45 PM, so too early.\n\nHaight-Ashbury is 16 minutes from Marina District. Arrive at 11:31 AM. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM, so too early.\n\nSo perhaps the only option after Joshua is to go to Presidio for Kimberly. Let's check the travel time: 22 minutes from Marina District. So leaving at 11:15 AM, arrive at Presidio at 11:37 AM. Kimberly is available from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So the person can wait at Presidio until 3:30 PM, then meet Kimberly for 15 minutes until 3:45 PM.\n\nThat seems possible, but it's a long wait. Alternatively, maybe it's better to meet someone else later.\n\nWait, let's think about the afternoon. After 3:30 PM, Kimberly is available. So if the person meets Joshua at 10:30 AM, leaves at 11:15 AM, goes to Presidio, arrives at 11:37 AM, waits until 3:30 PM, meets Kimberly until 3:45 PM, then proceeds.\n\nAfter that, what's next? Let's see who else is available.\n\nElizabeth at Alamo Square from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM. Travel time from Presidio to Alamo Square is 19 minutes. So if they leave Presidio at 3:45 PM, arrive at Alamo Square by 4:04 PM. But Elizabeth is only available from 7:15 PM, so that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go to another location after Kimberly. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Kimberly at 3:45 PM, maybe go to Alamo Square to meet Elizabeth, but she's only available from 7:15 PM, which is too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Marina District again? No, because Joshua already met.\n\nWait, maybe after Kimberly, go to Sunset District to meet Betty. She's available from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM. So if they leave Presidio at 3:45 PM, travel time to Sunset District is 15 minutes, arrive at 4:00 PM. Betty needs 60 minutes, so meeting ends at 5:00 PM.\n\nThat's possible. So meeting Betty from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nThen, after that, what's next? Let's see.\n\nAfter 5:00 PM, the person can go to Chinatown to meet Deborah. Travel time from Sunset District to Chinatown is 29 minutes. So leaving at 5:00 PM, arrive at 5:29 PM. Deborah is available from 5:15 PM to 8:30 PM, so that's possible. They can meet from 5:29 PM to 5:44 PM (15 minutes).\n\nThen, after that, maybe go to Financial District to meet Sandra. Travel time from Chinatown to Financial District is 5 minutes. So leaving at 5:44 PM, arrive by 5:49 PM. Sandra is available from 7:30 PM to 8:15 PM. So that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, go to Russian Hill for Barbara. Travel time from Chinatown to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. Arrive at 5:36 PM. Barbara is available from 5:30 PM to 9:15 PM. So they can meet from 5:36 PM to 6:36 PM (120 minutes). That's a long meeting, but possible.\n\nAfter that, perhaps go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leaving at 6:36 PM, arrive by 6:41 PM. Steven is available from 5:45 PM to 8:45 PM. So they can meet from 6:41 PM to 7:11 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThen, after that, maybe go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leaving at 7:11 PM, arrive at 7:29 PM. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, which is too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, maybe go to another location. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Steven until 7:11 PM, perhaps go to Sunset District again, but Betty is already met. Maybe go to Haight-Ashbury again, but Daniel is only available in the evening.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Barbara, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So leaving at 6:36 PM, arrive at 6:53 PM. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, which is too early.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Maybe it's better to meet Daniel earlier. Let's think.\n\nDaniel is available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM. So if the person can reach Haight-Ashbury by 6:30 PM, they can meet him for 15 minutes until 6:45 PM.\n\nSo how to get there by 6:30 PM. Let's see the travel times.\n\nFrom Union Square, Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So if the person starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM, goes to Haight-Ashbury at 9:18 AM, but Daniel isn't available until 6:30 PM. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting someone else, maybe go to Haight-Ashbury. For example, after meeting Joshua, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Marina District to Haight-Ashbury is 16 minutes. So leaving at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:31 AM. Daniel isn't available until 6:30 PM, so that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Betty at 4:00 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Sunset District to Haight-Ashbury is 15 minutes. So leaving at 4:00 PM, arrive at 4:15 PM. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM, so too early.\n\nAfter meeting Deborah at 5:29 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Chinatown to Haight-Ashbury is 19 minutes. So leaving at 5:29 PM, arrive at 5:48 PM. Still too early.\n\nAfter meeting Barbara at 6:36 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So arrive at 6:53 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so that's too late.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Barbara, go to North Beach for Steven. Then, after Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nAfter meeting Barbara from 6:36 PM to 7:36 PM, go to North Beach. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leave at 7:36 PM, arrive by 7:41 PM. Steven is available until 8:45 PM, so they can meet from 7:41 PM to 8:11 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThen, after meeting Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:29 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, which is way too early. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the person needs to prioritize the longer meetings first because they take up more time.\n\nBarbara needs 120 minutes, which is the longest. So maybe it's better to meet her later in the day.\n\nSimilarly, Steven needs 90 minutes, so meeting him later would be better.\n\nBut let's try to fit as many meetings as possible.\n\nAnother approach is to make a timeline, considering the travel times and the friends' availability.\n\nStarting at 9:00 AM at Union Square.\n\nFirst meeting: Joshua at Marina District from 10:30 AM. So they leave Union Square at 9:00 AM, travel 18 minutes, arrive at 9:18 AM. But Joshua isn't available until 10:30 AM. So they have to wait at Marina District from 9:18 AM to 10:30 AM. Then meet Joshua from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM.\n\nThen, after Joshua, go to Presidio to meet Kimberly. Travel time from Marina District to Presidio is 11 minutes. So leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at Presidio by 11:26 AM. Kimberly is available from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So they have to wait until 3:30 PM, then meet from 3:30 PM to 3:45 PM.\n\nThat's a long wait, but possible.\n\nAfter meeting Kimberly, go to Sunset District to meet Betty. Travel time from Presidio to Sunset District is 15 minutes. So leave at 3:45 PM, arrive by 4:00 PM. Betty is available from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM, so that's possible. Meet from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nThen, after Betty, go to Chinatown to meet Deborah. Travel time from Sunset District to Chinatown is 29 minutes. So leave at 5:00 PM, arrive by 5:29 PM. Deborah is available from 5:15 PM to 8:30 PM, so meet from 5:29 PM to 5:44 PM.\n\nThen, go to Financial District to meet Sandra. Travel time from Chinatown to Financial District is 5 minutes. So leave at 5:44 PM, arrive by 5:49 PM. Sandra is available from 7:30 PM to 8:15 PM, which is too early.\n\nAlternatively, go to Russian Hill to meet Barbara. Travel time from Chinatown to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. So leave at 5:44 PM, arrive at 5:51 PM. Barbara is available from 5:30 PM to 9:15 PM, so meet from 5:51 PM to 6:51 PM (120 minutes).\n\nThen, after Barbara, go to North Beach to meet Steven. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leave at 6:51 PM, arrive by 6:56 PM. Steven is available from 5:45 PM to 8:45 PM, so meet from 6:56 PM to 7:26 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThen, go to Haight-Ashbury to meet Daniel. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:44 PM. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, which is too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, maybe go to another location. Let's see.\n\nAfter Steven at 7:26 PM, go to Sunset District again. But Betty is already met. Alternatively, go to Haight-Ashbury again, but Daniel is too early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Barbara, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So leave at 6:51 PM, arrive at 7:08 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:44 PM. Still too early.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's impossible to meet Daniel. Let's see.\n\nDaniel is only available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM. So the person needs to be at Haight-Ashbury by 6:30 PM at the latest. So how to get there by 6:30 PM.\n\nFrom Union Square, Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leaving Union Square at 6:00 PM, arrive at 6:18 PM. But Daniel isn't available until 6:30 PM, so they can meet from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM.\n\nBut is that possible? Let's check the schedule.\n\nIf the person starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM, goes to Haight-Ashbury at 9:18 AM, but Daniel isn't available until 6:30 PM. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting someone else, go to Haight-Ashbury.\n\nFor example, after meeting Joshua at 11:15 AM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Marina District to Haight-Ashbury is 16 minutes. So leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:31 AM. Daniel isn't available until 6:30 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Betty at 4:00 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Sunset District to Haight-Ashbury is 15 minutes. So leave at 4:00 PM, arrive at 4:15 PM. Too early.\n\nAfter meeting Deborah at 5:29 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Chinatown to Haight-Ashbury is 19 minutes. So leave at 5:29 PM, arrive at 5:48 PM. Too early.\n\nAfter meeting Barbara at 6:36 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So leave at 6:36 PM, arrive at 6:53 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too late.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara at 6:36 PM, go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leave at 6:36 PM, arrive at 6:41 PM. Steven is available until 8:45 PM, so meet from 6:41 PM to 7:11 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThen, after Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 7:11 PM, arrive at 7:29 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nSo it seems that Daniel is difficult to meet because his time window is so short and early. Maybe it's better to skip him and meet as many others as possible.\n\nSo let's see the meetings so far:\n\n1. Joshua at Marina District from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM.\n2. Kimberly at Presidio from 3:30 PM to 3:45 PM.\n3. Betty at Sunset District from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n4. Deborah at Chinatown from 5:29 PM to 5:44 PM.\n5. Barbara at Russian Hill from 5:51 PM to 6:51 PM.\n6. Steven at North Beach from 6:56 PM to 7:26 PM.\n\nThat's six meetings. Now, can we fit more?\n\nAfter meeting Steven at 7:26 PM, perhaps go to another location. Let's see.\n\nFrom North Beach, the person can go to Chinatown, but Deborah is already met. Or go to Haight-Ashbury, but Daniel is too early. Or go to Russian Hill, but Barbara is already met.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, maybe go to Sunset District again, but Betty is already met.\n\nAlternatively, go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. Travel time from North Beach to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:41 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM, so meet from 7:41 PM to 8:11 PM (15 minutes).\n\nThen, after that, go to Financial District for Sandra. Travel time from Alamo Square to Financial District is 15 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:26 PM. Sandra is available from 7:30 PM to 8:15 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth, go to Financial District. But Sandra's window is too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth, go to another location. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Elizabeth at 8:11 PM, go to Financial District. Travel time from Alamo Square to Financial District is 15 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:26 PM. Sandra is available until 8:15 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. Travel time from Alamo Square to Haight-Ashbury is 5 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:16 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, go to Sunset District for Betty again, but she's already met.\n\nSo perhaps it's not possible to meet Elizabeth and Sandra.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. But as before, it's too early.\n\nSo the best we can do is six meetings: Joshua, Kimberly, Betty, Deborah, Barbara, Steven.\n\nWait, but let's check if we can rearrange the order to fit more meetings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Barbara later, which would allow more time for other meetings.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nStart at 9:00 AM at Union Square.\n\nFirst, meet Joshua at Marina District from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM.\n\nThen, go to Presidio for Kimberly. Travel time from Marina District to Presidio is 11 minutes. So leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at Presidio by 11:26 AM. Kimberly is available from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So wait until 3:30 PM, meet from 3:30 PM to 3:45 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District to meet Betty. Travel time from Presidio to Sunset District is 15 minutes. So leave at 3:45 PM, arrive by 4:00 PM. Meet Betty from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown for Deborah. Travel time from Sunset District to Chinatown is 29 minutes. So leave at 5:00 PM, arrive by 5:29 PM. Meet Deborah from 5:29 PM to 5:44 PM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill for Barbara. Travel time from Chinatown to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. So leave at 5:44 PM, arrive at 5:51 PM. Meet Barbara from 5:51 PM to 6:51 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leave at 6:51 PM, arrive at 6:56 PM. Meet Steven from 6:56 PM to 7:26 PM.\n\nThen, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:44 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. Travel time from North Beach to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:41 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM, so meet from 7:41 PM to 8:11 PM.\n\nThen, after that, go to Financial District for Sandra. Travel time from Alamo Square to Financial District is 15 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:26 PM. Sandra is available until 8:15 PM, so too early.\n\nSo that's six meetings again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Elizabeth earlier. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Deborah at 5:29 PM, go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. Travel time from Chinatown to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leave at 5:29 PM, arrive at 5:44 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara at 6:51 PM, go to Alamo Square. Travel time from Russian Hill to Alamo Square is 13 minutes. So leave at 6:51 PM, arrive at 7:04 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM, so too early.\n\nAfter meeting Steven at 7:26 PM, go to Alamo Square. Travel time from North Beach to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:41 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM, so meet from 7:41 PM to 8:11 PM.\n\nThen, after that, go to Financial District. Travel time from Alamo Square to Financial District is 15 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:26 PM. Sandra is available until 8:15 PM, so too early.\n\nSo again, six meetings.\n\nIt seems that Daniel is difficult to meet because his time window is so early. So maybe it's best to skip him and meet six people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Daniel earlier by adjusting the schedule.\n\nWait, let's see. If the person leaves Union Square at 6:00 PM, they can reach Haight-Ashbury by 6:18 PM. But Daniel is available from 6:30 PM. So they can wait at Haight-Ashbury from 6:18 PM to 6:30 PM, then meet from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM.\n\nBut how to fit that into the schedule.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAfter meeting Barbara at 6:36 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So leave at 6:36 PM, arrive at 6:53 PM. But Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara at 5:51 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So leave at 5:51 PM, arrive at 6:08 PM. Daniel is available until 6:30 PM, so meet from 6:08 PM to 6:23 PM.\n\nThen, after that, go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time from Haight-Ashbury to North Beach is 18 minutes. So leave at 6:23 PM, arrive at 6:41 PM. Steven is available until 8:45 PM, so meet from 6:41 PM to 7:11 PM.\n\nThen, after Steven, go to Presidio for Kimberly. Wait, Kimberly is already met earlier. Alternatively, go to Sunset District for Betty, but she's already met.\n\nAlternatively, go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. Travel time from North Beach to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leave at 7:11 PM, arrive at 7:26 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM, so meet from 7:26 PM to 8:11 PM.\n\nThen, after that, go to Financial District for Sandra. Travel time from Alamo Square to Financial District is 15 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:26 PM. Sandra is available until 8:15 PM, so too early.\n\nSo in this case, the person meets:\n\n1. Joshua\n2. Barbara\n3. Daniel\n4. Steven\n5. Elizabeth\n6. [Can't meet Sandra]\n\nThat's six meetings as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to meet Daniel and miss someone else.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize the number of meetings, so six seems better than five.\n\nWait, but in the previous approach, the person met six people: Joshua, Kimberly, Betty, Deborah, Barbara, Steven.\n\nIn this approach, they met six people: Joshua, Barbara, Daniel, Steven, Elizabeth, and missed some others.\n\nBut in the first approach, they met six people, in the second approach, also six people, but different ones.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, they missed Barbara and Steven, but met Kimberly, Betty, Deborah, Barbara, Steven, Elizabeth. Wait, no, in the first approach, they met Barbara and Steven.\n\nWait, no, in the first approach, after meeting Barbara at 6:36 PM, Steven at 7:26 PM, and Elizabeth at 8:11 PM, but Sandra wasn't met.\n\nIn the second approach, they met Daniel instead of Barbara and Steven.\n\nWait, no, in the second approach, they met Barbara and Daniel, then Steven, Elizabeth.\n\nSo both approaches result in six meetings.\n\nBut in the first approach, they met Barbara and Steven, while in the second approach, they met Daniel instead of Barbara.\n\nBut Barbara needs a longer meeting time (120 minutes), which might be better to do later in the day to avoid conflicts.\n\nSo perhaps the first approach is better.\n\nIn the first approach, the person meets:\n\n1. Joshua (10:30-11:15 AM)\n2. Kimberly (3:30-3:45 PM)\n3. Betty (4:00-5:00 PM)\n4. Deborah (5:29-5:44 PM)\n5. Barbara (5:51-6:51 PM)\n6. Steven (6:56-7:26 PM)\n\nThat's six meetings, totaling 15+15+60+15+120+90 = 315 minutes.\n\nIn the second approach, meeting Daniel instead of Barbara and Steven, but same number of meetings.\n\nBut Barbara is a longer meeting, which might allow more time for others, but in this case, it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to fit more meetings by adjusting the order.\n\nWait, let's see. After meeting Barbara at 6:51 PM, go to North Beach for Steven. Then, after Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. But as before, Daniel is too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury. But same issue.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara, go to Haight-Ashbury. Then, after that, go to North Beach for Steven. But again, Daniel is too early.\n\nSo it's not possible to meet Daniel in this schedule.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of meetings possible is six, including Joshua, Kimberly, Betty, Deborah, Barbara, Steven.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Daniel and miss someone else, but that would be five meetings, which is worse.\n\nSo the best plan is to meet six friends: Joshua, Kimberly, Betty, Deborah, Barbara, Steven.\n\nNow, let's check the travel times and see if the person can move between these locations without missing any.\n\nStarting at Union Square at 9:00 AM.\n\n1. Meet Joshua at Marina District: 10:30 AM. So travel from 9:00 to 10:30, which is 30 minutes, but the travel time is 18 minutes. So they arrive at 9:18 AM, but Joshua isn't available until 10:30 AM. So wait at Marina District from 9:18 to 10:30 AM, then meet from 10:30 to 11:15 AM.\n\n2. After Joshua, go to Presidio for Kimberly. Travel time from Marina District to Presidio is 11 minutes. So leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:26 AM. Kimberly is available from 3:30 PM, so wait until 3:30 PM, meet from 3:30 to 3:45 PM.\n\n3. After Kimberly, go to Sunset District for Betty. Travel time from Presidio to Sunset District is 15 minutes. So leave at 3:45 PM, arrive by 4:00 PM. Meet from 4:00 to 5:00 PM.\n\n4. After Betty, go to Chinatown for Deborah. Travel time from Sunset District to Chinatown is 29 minutes. So leave at 5:00 PM, arrive by 5:29 PM. Meet from 5:29 to 5:44 PM.\n\n5. After Deborah, go to Russian Hill for Barbara. Travel time from Chinatown to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. So leave at 5:44 PM, arrive at 5:51 PM. Meet from 5:51 to 6:51 PM.\n\n6. After Barbara, go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leave at 6:51 PM, arrive at 6:56 PM. Meet from 6:56 to 7:26 PM.\n\nThen, they can't meet Daniel because of his time window.\n\nSo that's six meetings.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel, but as discussed, it's too early.\n\nTherefore, the best schedule includes six meetings.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"Joshua\", \"start_time\": \"10:30\", \"end_time\": \"11:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Presidio\", \"person\": \"Kimberly\", \"start_time\": \"03:30\", \"end_time\": \"03:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Sunset District\", \"person\": \"Betty\", \"start_time\": \"04:00\", \"end_time\": \"05:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"person\": \"Deborah\", \"start_time\": \"05:29\", \"end_time\": \"05:44\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Russian Hill\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"05:51\", \"end_time\": \"06:51\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Steven\", \"start_time\": \"06:56\", \"end_time\": \"07:26\"}\n  ]\n}",
            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to help this person who's in San Francisco for the day and wants to meet as many friends as possible. They arrive at Union Square at 9:00 AM and have to schedule meetings considering the travel times and the friends' availability. Each friend has specific time windows and locations where they can meet, and each meeting requires a certain minimum time. The goal is to maximize the number of meetings without overlapping, considering the travel times from Union Square to each location and back.\n\nFirst, I need to list out all the friends and their meeting details:\n\n- Kimberly at Presidio from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n- Elizabeth at Alamo Square from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n- Joshua at Marina District from 10:30 AM to 2:15 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n- Sandra at Financial District from 7:30 PM to 8:15 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n- Kenneth at Nob Hill from 12:45 PM to 9:45 PM, needs 30 minutes.\n- Betty at Sunset District from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM, needs 60 minutes.\n- Deborah at Chinatown from 5:15 PM to 8:30 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n- Barbara at Russian Hill from 5:30 PM to 9:15 PM, needs 120 minutes.\n- Steven at North Beach from 5:45 PM to 8:45 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n- Daniel at Haight-Ashbury from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n\nNow, the person starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM. So the first thing is to figure out who can be met earliest in the day. Joshua is available from 10:30 AM at Marina District. The travel time from Union Square to Marina District is 18 minutes, so they can arrive there by 10:30 AM. The meeting needs 45 minutes, so they can leave at 11:15 AM. That seems doable.\n\nNext, after meeting Joshua, the person can head to another location. Let's see who's available after 11:15 AM. Kenneth is at Nob Hill until 9:45 PM, so that's possible. The travel time to Nob Hill is 9 minutes, so they can get there by 11:24 AM. They need 30 minutes, so the meeting would end at 11:54 AM. That works, but they might want to check if there's a better option.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua, maybe meeting someone else earlier. Let's see. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, but that's later, so maybe not the best option to do early. Deborah is at Chinatown from 5:15 PM, which is later. Same with others.\n\nWait, but let's think about the travel times. After meeting Joshua at Marina District, maybe the next best option is to go to Presidio to meet Kimberly. The travel time is 22 minutes, so they can arrive at Presidio by 10:30 AM + 18 minutes (Marina) + 22 minutes (Presidio) = 11:52 AM. But Kimberly is only available from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So that might not work because the person would arrive too early. So maybe better to meet Kimberly later.\n\nSo after Joshua, maybe the next best is to go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. The travel time from Marina District to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So if they leave Marina District at 11:15 AM, they can arrive at Alamo Square by 11:30 AM. But Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM. So that's way too early. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Joshua, perhaps go to another location. Let's check the times. Maybe after Joshua, go to Financial District for Sandra, but Sandra is available from 7:30 PM, which is too late.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to meet someone who can be reached quickly after Joshua and has a later availability. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua, maybe go to Chinatown for Deborah. Travel time from Marina District to Chinatown is 15 minutes. So they can leave Marina District at 11:15 AM, arrive at Chinatown at 11:30 AM. Deborah is available from 5:15 PM, so that's too early. Not possible.\n\nSimilarly, North Beach is 11 minutes from Marina District. Steven is at North Beach from 5:45 PM, so too early.\n\nHaight-Ashbury is 16 minutes from Marina District. Daniel is there from 6:30 PM, so still too early.\n\nSo after Joshua, maybe it's better to go to a place where the next meeting can be scheduled later. Let's consider meeting someone else.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of meeting Joshua first, maybe meet someone else earlier. Let me check who else is available in the morning.\n\nLooking at the times, Joshua starts at 10:30 AM, which is the earliest. So maybe that's the first meeting.\n\nAfter Joshua, the next possible friend is Betty at Sunset District from 2:00 PM. The travel time from Marina District to Sunset District is 21 minutes. So they can leave Marina District at 11:15 AM, arrive at Sunset District by 11:36 AM. But Betty is only available from 2:00 PM. So that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua, maybe go to Presidio to meet Kimberly. But as I thought earlier, Kimberly is only available from 3:30 PM. So the person would have to wait at Presidio from 10:30 AM until 3:30 PM, which is 5 hours. That's a long wait, but possible.\n\nBut the problem is that the person needs to move efficiently. Maybe better to meet someone else after Joshua.\n\nWait, let's see the times again. After meeting Joshua until 11:15 AM, the next possible meeting could be with Kenneth at Nob Hill, which is 9 minutes from Union Square. So if they leave Marina District at 11:15 AM, travel time is 21 minutes, so arrive at Sunset District at 11:36 AM. But Betty is only available from 2:00 PM, so that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua, maybe go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth, but she's only available in the evening.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to meet Joshua first, then go to Presidio to meet Kimberly, but that would require waiting a long time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet someone else in the morning.\n\nWait, let's check the travel times from Union Square:\n\n- Joshua: 18 minutes to Marina District.\n- Kenneth: 9 minutes to Nob Hill.\n- Deborah: 7 minutes to Chinatown.\n- Steven: 11 minutes to North Beach.\n- Daniel: 18 minutes to Haight-Ashbury.\n\nSo after Joshua, perhaps go to Chinatown for Deborah. The travel time from Marina District to Chinatown is 15 minutes. So leaving at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:30 AM. But Deborah is only available from 5:15 PM, so that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time 11 minutes from Marina District. Arrive at 11:26 AM. Steven is available from 5:45 PM, so too early.\n\nHaight-Ashbury is 16 minutes from Marina District. Arrive at 11:31 AM. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM, so too early.\n\nSo perhaps the only option after Joshua is to go to Presidio for Kimberly. Let's check the travel time: 22 minutes from Marina District. So leaving at 11:15 AM, arrive at Presidio at 11:37 AM. Kimberly is available from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So the person can wait at Presidio until 3:30 PM, then meet Kimberly for 15 minutes until 3:45 PM.\n\nThat seems possible, but it's a long wait. Alternatively, maybe it's better to meet someone else later.\n\nWait, let's think about the afternoon. After 3:30 PM, Kimberly is available. So if the person meets Joshua at 10:30 AM, leaves at 11:15 AM, goes to Presidio, arrives at 11:37 AM, waits until 3:30 PM, meets Kimberly until 3:45 PM, then proceeds.\n\nAfter that, what's next? Let's see who else is available.\n\nElizabeth at Alamo Square from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM. Travel time from Presidio to Alamo Square is 19 minutes. So if they leave Presidio at 3:45 PM, arrive at Alamo Square by 4:04 PM. But Elizabeth is only available from 7:15 PM, so that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go to another location after Kimberly. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Kimberly at 3:45 PM, maybe go to Alamo Square to meet Elizabeth, but she's only available from 7:15 PM, which is too late.\n\nAlternatively, go to Marina District again? No, because Joshua already met.\n\nWait, maybe after Kimberly, go to Sunset District to meet Betty. She's available from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM. So if they leave Presidio at 3:45 PM, travel time to Sunset District is 15 minutes, arrive at 4:00 PM. Betty needs 60 minutes, so meeting ends at 5:00 PM.\n\nThat's possible. So meeting Betty from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nThen, after that, what's next? Let's see.\n\nAfter 5:00 PM, the person can go to Chinatown to meet Deborah. Travel time from Sunset District to Chinatown is 29 minutes. So leaving at 5:00 PM, arrive at 5:29 PM. Deborah is available from 5:15 PM to 8:30 PM, so that's possible. They can meet from 5:29 PM to 5:44 PM (15 minutes).\n\nThen, after that, maybe go to Financial District to meet Sandra. Travel time from Chinatown to Financial District is 5 minutes. So leaving at 5:44 PM, arrive by 5:49 PM. Sandra is available from 7:30 PM to 8:15 PM. So that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, go to Russian Hill for Barbara. Travel time from Chinatown to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. Arrive at 5:36 PM. Barbara is available from 5:30 PM to 9:15 PM. So they can meet from 5:36 PM to 6:36 PM (120 minutes). That's a long meeting, but possible.\n\nAfter that, perhaps go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leaving at 6:36 PM, arrive by 6:41 PM. Steven is available from 5:45 PM to 8:45 PM. So they can meet from 6:41 PM to 7:11 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThen, after that, maybe go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leaving at 7:11 PM, arrive at 7:29 PM. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, which is too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, maybe go to another location. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Steven until 7:11 PM, perhaps go to Sunset District again, but Betty is already met. Maybe go to Haight-Ashbury again, but Daniel is only available in the evening.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Barbara, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So leaving at 6:36 PM, arrive at 6:53 PM. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, which is too early.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Maybe it's better to meet Daniel earlier. Let's think.\n\nDaniel is available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM. So if the person can reach Haight-Ashbury by 6:30 PM, they can meet him for 15 minutes until 6:45 PM.\n\nSo how to get there by 6:30 PM. Let's see the travel times.\n\nFrom Union Square, Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So if the person starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM, goes to Haight-Ashbury at 9:18 AM, but Daniel isn't available until 6:30 PM. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting someone else, maybe go to Haight-Ashbury. For example, after meeting Joshua, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Marina District to Haight-Ashbury is 16 minutes. So leaving at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:31 AM. Daniel isn't available until 6:30 PM, so that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Betty at 4:00 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Sunset District to Haight-Ashbury is 15 minutes. So leaving at 4:00 PM, arrive at 4:15 PM. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM, so too early.\n\nAfter meeting Deborah at 5:29 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Chinatown to Haight-Ashbury is 19 minutes. So leaving at 5:29 PM, arrive at 5:48 PM. Still too early.\n\nAfter meeting Barbara at 6:36 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So arrive at 6:53 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so that's too late.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Barbara, go to North Beach for Steven. Then, after Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nAfter meeting Barbara from 6:36 PM to 7:36 PM, go to North Beach. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leave at 7:36 PM, arrive by 7:41 PM. Steven is available until 8:45 PM, so they can meet from 7:41 PM to 8:11 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThen, after meeting Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:29 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, which is way too early. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the person needs to prioritize the longer meetings first because they take up more time.\n\nBarbara needs 120 minutes, which is the longest. So maybe it's better to meet her later in the day.\n\nSimilarly, Steven needs 90 minutes, so meeting him later would be better.\n\nBut let's try to fit as many meetings as possible.\n\nAnother approach is to make a timeline, considering the travel times and the friends' availability.\n\nStarting at 9:00 AM at Union Square.\n\nFirst meeting: Joshua at Marina District from 10:30 AM. So they leave Union Square at 9:00 AM, travel 18 minutes, arrive at 9:18 AM. But Joshua isn't available until 10:30 AM. So they have to wait at Marina District from 9:18 AM to 10:30 AM. Then meet Joshua from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM.\n\nThen, after Joshua, go to Presidio to meet Kimberly. Travel time from Marina District to Presidio is 11 minutes. So leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at Presidio by 11:26 AM. Kimberly is available from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So they have to wait until 3:30 PM, then meet from 3:30 PM to 3:45 PM.\n\nThat's a long wait, but possible.\n\nAfter meeting Kimberly, go to Sunset District to meet Betty. Travel time from Presidio to Sunset District is 15 minutes. So leave at 3:45 PM, arrive by 4:00 PM. Betty is available from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM, so that's possible. Meet from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nThen, after Betty, go to Chinatown to meet Deborah. Travel time from Sunset District to Chinatown is 29 minutes. So leave at 5:00 PM, arrive by 5:29 PM. Deborah is available from 5:15 PM to 8:30 PM, so meet from 5:29 PM to 5:44 PM.\n\nThen, go to Financial District to meet Sandra. Travel time from Chinatown to Financial District is 5 minutes. So leave at 5:44 PM, arrive by 5:49 PM. Sandra is available from 7:30 PM to 8:15 PM, which is too early.\n\nAlternatively, go to Russian Hill to meet Barbara. Travel time from Chinatown to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. So leave at 5:44 PM, arrive at 5:51 PM. Barbara is available from 5:30 PM to 9:15 PM, so meet from 5:51 PM to 6:51 PM (120 minutes).\n\nThen, after Barbara, go to North Beach to meet Steven. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leave at 6:51 PM, arrive by 6:56 PM. Steven is available from 5:45 PM to 8:45 PM, so meet from 6:56 PM to 7:26 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThen, go to Haight-Ashbury to meet Daniel. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:44 PM. Daniel is available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM, which is too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, maybe go to another location. Let's see.\n\nAfter Steven at 7:26 PM, go to Sunset District again. But Betty is already met. Alternatively, go to Haight-Ashbury again, but Daniel is too early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Barbara, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So leave at 6:51 PM, arrive at 7:08 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:44 PM. Still too early.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's impossible to meet Daniel. Let's see.\n\nDaniel is only available from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM. So the person needs to be at Haight-Ashbury by 6:30 PM at the latest. So how to get there by 6:30 PM.\n\nFrom Union Square, Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leaving Union Square at 6:00 PM, arrive at 6:18 PM. But Daniel isn't available until 6:30 PM, so they can meet from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM.\n\nBut is that possible? Let's check the schedule.\n\nIf the person starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM, goes to Haight-Ashbury at 9:18 AM, but Daniel isn't available until 6:30 PM. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting someone else, go to Haight-Ashbury.\n\nFor example, after meeting Joshua at 11:15 AM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Marina District to Haight-Ashbury is 16 minutes. So leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:31 AM. Daniel isn't available until 6:30 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Betty at 4:00 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Sunset District to Haight-Ashbury is 15 minutes. So leave at 4:00 PM, arrive at 4:15 PM. Too early.\n\nAfter meeting Deborah at 5:29 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Chinatown to Haight-Ashbury is 19 minutes. So leave at 5:29 PM, arrive at 5:48 PM. Too early.\n\nAfter meeting Barbara at 6:36 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So leave at 6:36 PM, arrive at 6:53 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too late.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara at 6:36 PM, go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leave at 6:36 PM, arrive at 6:41 PM. Steven is available until 8:45 PM, so meet from 6:41 PM to 7:11 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThen, after Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 7:11 PM, arrive at 7:29 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nSo it seems that Daniel is difficult to meet because his time window is so short and early. Maybe it's better to skip him and meet as many others as possible.\n\nSo let's see the meetings so far:\n\n1. Joshua at Marina District from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM.\n2. Kimberly at Presidio from 3:30 PM to 3:45 PM.\n3. Betty at Sunset District from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n4. Deborah at Chinatown from 5:29 PM to 5:44 PM.\n5. Barbara at Russian Hill from 5:51 PM to 6:51 PM.\n6. Steven at North Beach from 6:56 PM to 7:26 PM.\n\nThat's six meetings. Now, can we fit more?\n\nAfter meeting Steven at 7:26 PM, perhaps go to another location. Let's see.\n\nFrom North Beach, the person can go to Chinatown, but Deborah is already met. Or go to Haight-Ashbury, but Daniel is too early. Or go to Russian Hill, but Barbara is already met.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, maybe go to Sunset District again, but Betty is already met.\n\nAlternatively, go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. Travel time from North Beach to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:41 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM, so meet from 7:41 PM to 8:11 PM (15 minutes).\n\nThen, after that, go to Financial District for Sandra. Travel time from Alamo Square to Financial District is 15 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:26 PM. Sandra is available from 7:30 PM to 8:15 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth, go to Financial District. But Sandra's window is too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth, go to another location. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Elizabeth at 8:11 PM, go to Financial District. Travel time from Alamo Square to Financial District is 15 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:26 PM. Sandra is available until 8:15 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. Travel time from Alamo Square to Haight-Ashbury is 5 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:16 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, go to Sunset District for Betty again, but she's already met.\n\nSo perhaps it's not possible to meet Elizabeth and Sandra.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. But as before, it's too early.\n\nSo the best we can do is six meetings: Joshua, Kimberly, Betty, Deborah, Barbara, Steven.\n\nWait, but let's check if we can rearrange the order to fit more meetings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Barbara later, which would allow more time for other meetings.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nStart at 9:00 AM at Union Square.\n\nFirst, meet Joshua at Marina District from 10:30 AM to 11:15 AM.\n\nThen, go to Presidio for Kimberly. Travel time from Marina District to Presidio is 11 minutes. So leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at Presidio by 11:26 AM. Kimberly is available from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So wait until 3:30 PM, meet from 3:30 PM to 3:45 PM.\n\nThen, go to Sunset District to meet Betty. Travel time from Presidio to Sunset District is 15 minutes. So leave at 3:45 PM, arrive by 4:00 PM. Meet Betty from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nThen, go to Chinatown for Deborah. Travel time from Sunset District to Chinatown is 29 minutes. So leave at 5:00 PM, arrive by 5:29 PM. Meet Deborah from 5:29 PM to 5:44 PM.\n\nThen, go to Russian Hill for Barbara. Travel time from Chinatown to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. So leave at 5:44 PM, arrive at 5:51 PM. Meet Barbara from 5:51 PM to 6:51 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leave at 6:51 PM, arrive at 6:56 PM. Meet Steven from 6:56 PM to 7:26 PM.\n\nThen, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. Travel time from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:44 PM. Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. Travel time from North Beach to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:41 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM, so meet from 7:41 PM to 8:11 PM.\n\nThen, after that, go to Financial District for Sandra. Travel time from Alamo Square to Financial District is 15 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:26 PM. Sandra is available until 8:15 PM, so too early.\n\nSo that's six meetings again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Elizabeth earlier. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Deborah at 5:29 PM, go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. Travel time from Chinatown to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leave at 5:29 PM, arrive at 5:44 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara at 6:51 PM, go to Alamo Square. Travel time from Russian Hill to Alamo Square is 13 minutes. So leave at 6:51 PM, arrive at 7:04 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM, so too early.\n\nAfter meeting Steven at 7:26 PM, go to Alamo Square. Travel time from North Beach to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leave at 7:26 PM, arrive at 7:41 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM, so meet from 7:41 PM to 8:11 PM.\n\nThen, after that, go to Financial District. Travel time from Alamo Square to Financial District is 15 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:26 PM. Sandra is available until 8:15 PM, so too early.\n\nSo again, six meetings.\n\nIt seems that Daniel is difficult to meet because his time window is so early. So maybe it's best to skip him and meet six people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Daniel earlier by adjusting the schedule.\n\nWait, let's see. If the person leaves Union Square at 6:00 PM, they can reach Haight-Ashbury by 6:18 PM. But Daniel is available from 6:30 PM. So they can wait at Haight-Ashbury from 6:18 PM to 6:30 PM, then meet from 6:30 PM to 6:45 PM.\n\nBut how to fit that into the schedule.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAfter meeting Barbara at 6:36 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So leave at 6:36 PM, arrive at 6:53 PM. But Daniel is available until 6:45 PM, so too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara at 5:51 PM, go to Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 minutes. So leave at 5:51 PM, arrive at 6:08 PM. Daniel is available until 6:30 PM, so meet from 6:08 PM to 6:23 PM.\n\nThen, after that, go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time from Haight-Ashbury to North Beach is 18 minutes. So leave at 6:23 PM, arrive at 6:41 PM. Steven is available until 8:45 PM, so meet from 6:41 PM to 7:11 PM.\n\nThen, after Steven, go to Presidio for Kimberly. Wait, Kimberly is already met earlier. Alternatively, go to Sunset District for Betty, but she's already met.\n\nAlternatively, go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. Travel time from North Beach to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leave at 7:11 PM, arrive at 7:26 PM. Elizabeth is available from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM, so meet from 7:26 PM to 8:11 PM.\n\nThen, after that, go to Financial District for Sandra. Travel time from Alamo Square to Financial District is 15 minutes. So leave at 8:11 PM, arrive at 8:26 PM. Sandra is available until 8:15 PM, so too early.\n\nSo in this case, the person meets:\n\n1. Joshua\n2. Barbara\n3. Daniel\n4. Steven\n5. Elizabeth\n6. [Can't meet Sandra]\n\nThat's six meetings as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to meet Daniel and miss someone else.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize the number of meetings, so six seems better than five.\n\nWait, but in the previous approach, the person met six people: Joshua, Kimberly, Betty, Deborah, Barbara, Steven.\n\nIn this approach, they met six people: Joshua, Barbara, Daniel, Steven, Elizabeth, and missed some others.\n\nBut in the first approach, they met six people, in the second approach, also six people, but different ones.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, they missed Barbara and Steven, but met Kimberly, Betty, Deborah, Barbara, Steven, Elizabeth. Wait, no, in the first approach, they met Barbara and Steven.\n\nWait, no, in the first approach, after meeting Barbara at 6:36 PM, Steven at 7:26 PM, and Elizabeth at 8:11 PM, but Sandra wasn't met.\n\nIn the second approach, they met Daniel instead of Barbara and Steven.\n\nWait, no, in the second approach, they met Barbara and Daniel, then Steven, Elizabeth.\n\nSo both approaches result in six meetings.\n\nBut in the first approach, they met Barbara and Steven, while in the second approach, they met Daniel instead of Barbara.\n\nBut Barbara needs a longer meeting time (120 minutes), which might be better to do later in the day to avoid conflicts.\n\nSo perhaps the first approach is better.\n\nIn the first approach, the person meets:\n\n1. Joshua (10:30-11:15 AM)\n2. Kimberly (3:30-3:45 PM)\n3. Betty (4:00-5:00 PM)\n4. Deborah (5:29-5:44 PM)\n5. Barbara (5:51-6:51 PM)\n6. Steven (6:56-7:26 PM)\n\nThat's six meetings, totaling 15+15+60+15+120+90 = 315 minutes.\n\nIn the second approach, meeting Daniel instead of Barbara and Steven, but same number of meetings.\n\nBut Barbara is a longer meeting, which might allow more time for others, but in this case, it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to fit more meetings by adjusting the order.\n\nWait, let's see. After meeting Barbara at 6:51 PM, go to North Beach for Steven. Then, after Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel. But as before, Daniel is too early.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, go to Haight-Ashbury. But same issue.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara, go to Haight-Ashbury. Then, after that, go to North Beach for Steven. But again, Daniel is too early.\n\nSo it's not possible to meet Daniel in this schedule.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of meetings possible is six, including Joshua, Kimberly, Betty, Deborah, Barbara, Steven.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Daniel and miss someone else, but that would be five meetings, which is worse.\n\nSo the best plan is to meet six friends: Joshua, Kimberly, Betty, Deborah, Barbara, Steven.\n\nNow, let's check the travel times and see if the person can move between these locations without missing any.\n\nStarting at Union Square at 9:00 AM.\n\n1. Meet Joshua at Marina District: 10:30 AM. So travel from 9:00 to 10:30, which is 30 minutes, but the travel time is 18 minutes. So they arrive at 9:18 AM, but Joshua isn't available until 10:30 AM. So wait at Marina District from 9:18 to 10:30 AM, then meet from 10:30 to 11:15 AM.\n\n2. After Joshua, go to Presidio for Kimberly. Travel time from Marina District to Presidio is 11 minutes. So leave at 11:15 AM, arrive at 11:26 AM. Kimberly is available from 3:30 PM, so wait until 3:30 PM, meet from 3:30 to 3:45 PM.\n\n3. After Kimberly, go to Sunset District for Betty. Travel time from Presidio to Sunset District is 15 minutes. So leave at 3:45 PM, arrive by 4:00 PM. Meet from 4:00 to 5:00 PM.\n\n4. After Betty, go to Chinatown for Deborah. Travel time from Sunset District to Chinatown is 29 minutes. So leave at 5:00 PM, arrive by 5:29 PM. Meet from 5:29 to 5:44 PM.\n\n5. After Deborah, go to Russian Hill for Barbara. Travel time from Chinatown to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. So leave at 5:44 PM, arrive at 5:51 PM. Meet from 5:51 to 6:51 PM.\n\n6. After Barbara, go to North Beach for Steven. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 5 minutes. So leave at 6:51 PM, arrive at 6:56 PM. Meet from 6:56 to 7:26 PM.\n\nThen, they can't meet Daniel because of his time window.\n\nSo that's six meetings.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Barbara, go to Haight-Ashbury for Daniel, but as discussed, it's too early.\n\nTherefore, the best schedule includes six meetings.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:"
