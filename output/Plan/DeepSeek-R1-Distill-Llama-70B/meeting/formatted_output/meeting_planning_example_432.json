            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to plan this day of meetings in San Francisco. I've been given a bunch of travel distances between different locations, and I need to schedule meetings efficiently. My goal is to meet as many friends as possible, so I want to maximize the number of people I can meet without overlapping or causing too much travel time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. I arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM, and there are specific people I need to meet at different locations. Each person has a preferred time window and a minimum meeting duration. I need to make sure that I can travel between locations without causing too much backtracking, and that I can meet each person within their available time.\n\nLooking at the travel distances, I see that Golden Gate Park is connected to several areas like Fisherman's Wharf, Bayview, Mission District, Embarcadero, and Financial District. The distances vary, so I need to choose the most efficient path each time.\n\nStarting with Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf. He's available from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM. Since I'm at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM, I can go to Fisherman's Wharf. The distance from Golden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes. That seems doable. I can meet Joseph for 90 minutes. After that, I need to go to Bayview to meet Jeffrey. The distance from Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26 minutes. That's manageable.\n\nNext, I need to meet Kevin at Mission District from 11:15 AM to 3:15 PM. From Bayview to Mission District is 15 minutes. I can do that after meeting Jeffrey. Then, I have to go to Embarcadero to meet David from 8:15 AM to 9:00 AM. Wait, but I'm already at Bayview after meeting Jeffrey. The distance from Bayview to Embarcadero is 19 minutes. That's doable, but I have to make sure I can get back on time.\n\nAfter meeting David, I need to go to Financial District to meet Barbara from 10:30 AM to 4:30 PM. The distance from Embarcadero to Financial District is 4 minutes. That's quick. I can meet Barbara and then head back to Golden Gate Park if needed.\n\nBut I also need to consider the travel times and make sure I'm not backtracking too much. Maybe I can plan the meetings in a way that minimizes travel. For example, after meeting Joseph, go to Fisherman's Wharf, then to Bayview, then to Mission District, then to Embarcadero, then to Financial District.\n\nI need to make sure that each meeting is scheduled within the person's available time and that I can travel between locations without exceeding reasonable time limits.\n\nWait, I also need to consider the return trips. If I go from Golden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf, then to Bayview, then to Mission District, then to Embarcadero, and then to Financial District, I might need to plan the return trip as well. But since the day is ending, maybe I don't need to return to Golden Gate Park after the last meeting.\n\nI should also check the total time spent traveling versus the time spent meeting to make sure it's efficient.\n\nHmm, maybe I can start with the earliest available meeting and work my way through the day. Let's see:\n\n1. Meet Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM. Then go to Bayview to meet Jeffrey from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM. Then go to Mission District to meet Kevin from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM. Then go to Embarcadero to meet David from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM. Then go to Financial District to meet Barbara from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM.\n\nThat seems to fit within the time constraints. The travel times between these locations are all under 30 minutes, so it should be manageable.\n\nI think this plan works. I can start at Golden Gate Park, go to Fisherman's Wharf, then to Bayview, Mission District, Embarcadero, and finally to Financial District. Each meeting is within the person's available time, and the travel times are reasonable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"location\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
