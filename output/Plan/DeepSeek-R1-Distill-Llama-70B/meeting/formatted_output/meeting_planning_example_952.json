            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to schedule my meetings in San Francisco. I arrive at Bayview at 9:00 AM, and I want to meet as many friends as possible. Let's see who I can meet and when.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the people and their availability:\n\n1. **Brian** is at North Beach from 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM. He needs at least 90 minutes. That's a good chunk of time, so maybe I can meet him in the afternoon.\n\n2. **Richard** is at Fisherman's Wharf from 11:00 AM to 12:45 PM. He needs 60 minutes. That's a shorter window, but I can fit that in the morning.\n\n3. **Ashley** is at Haight-Ashbury from 3:00 PM to 8:30 PM. She needs 90 minutes. That's later in the day.\n\n4. **Elizabeth** is at Nob Hill from 11:45 AM to 6:30 PM. She needs 75 minutes. That's a long time, so maybe I can meet her in the late morning or early afternoon.\n\n5. **Jessica** is at Golden Gate Park from 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM. She needs 105 minutes. That's evening time, but I might have to squeeze that in.\n\n6. **Deborah** is at Union Square from 5:30 PM to 10:00 PM. She needs 60 minutes. That's a good time slot in the evening.\n\n7. **Kimberly** is at Alamo Square from 5:30 PM to 9:15 PM. She needs 45 minutes. That's also in the evening.\n\n8. **Matthew** is at Presidio from 8:15 AM to 9:00 AM. He needs 15 minutes. That's early in the morning, but maybe I can meet him quickly.\n\n9. **Kenneth** is at Chinatown from 1:45 PM to 7:30 PM. He needs 105 minutes. That's a long time, so maybe I can meet him in the afternoon.\n\n10. **Anthony** is at Pacific Heights from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. He needs 30 minutes. That's a short window, so I need to plan carefully.\n\nNow, considering I arrive at Bayview at 9:00 AM, I should start by checking who is available in the morning. **Richard** is at Fisherman's Wharf from 11:00 AM to 12:45 PM. That's a 1.5-hour window. I can meet him at 11:00 AM, but I need to account for travel time from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf, which is 25 minutes. So, I would arrive at 11:25 AM, but he's available from 11:00 AM. Maybe I can adjust the meeting time to 11:30 AM, which gives me a bit more flexibility.\n\nNext, **Matthew** is at Presidio from 8:15 AM to 9:00 AM. That's a 45-minute window, but I arrive at Bayview at 9:00 AM. The travel time from Bayview to Presidio is 32 minutes. If I leave Bayview at 8:30 AM, I can arrive at Presidio by 9:00 AM, but Matthew is only available until 9:00 AM. Maybe I can meet him at 8:45 AM, but that's cutting it close. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to meet him later if possible.\n\nLooking at the afternoon, **Brian** is at North Beach from 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM. That's a good window. If I leave Bayview at 12:45 PM, it would take 25 minutes to get to North Beach, arriving at 1:10 PM. That fits well within his availability.\n\n**Elizabeth** is at Nob Hill from 11:45 AM to 6:30 PM. She needs 75 minutes. If I meet her at 12:00 PM, that would give me a buffer. Travel time from Bayview to Nob Hill is 19 minutes, so I can leave Bayview at 11:41 AM to arrive by 12:00 PM.\n\n**Kenneth** is at Chinatown from 1:45 PM to 7:30 PM. He needs 105 minutes. If I meet him at 2:00 PM, that's a good time. Travel time from Bayview to Chinatown is 19 minutes, so I can leave at 1:41 PM to arrive by 2:00 PM.\n\n**Ashley** is at Haight-Ashbury from 3:00 PM to 8:30 PM. She needs 90 minutes. If I leave Bayview at 2:40 PM, it's a 19-minute drive, arriving at 2:59 PM. That fits well within her window.\n\n**Deborah** is at Union Square from 5:30 PM to 10:00 PM. She needs 60 minutes. If I meet her at 6:00 PM, that's a good time. Travel time from Bayview to Union Square is 15 minutes, so I can leave at 5:45 PM to arrive by 6:00 PM.\n\n**Kimberly** is at Alamo Square from 5:30 PM to 9:15 PM. She needs 45 minutes. If I meet her at 6:15 PM, that's a good time. Travel time from Bayview to Alamo Square is 16 minutes, so I can leave at 5:59 PM to arrive by 6:15 PM.\n\n**Jessica** is at Golden Gate Park from 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM. She needs 105 minutes. If I meet her at 8:30 PM, that's a good time. Travel time from Bayview to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes, so I can leave at 8:08 PM to arrive by 8:30 PM.\n\n**Anthony** is at Pacific Heights from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. He needs 30 minutes. If I meet him at 3:00 PM, that's a good time. Travel time from Bayview to Pacific Heights is 23 minutes, so I can leave at 2:37 PM to arrive by 3:00 PM.\n\nNow, considering all these, I need to make sure I don't overbook myself. I have to leave enough time between meetings for travel. Starting from Bayview, my first meeting is with **Richard** at Fisherman's Wharf at 11:30 AM. Then, perhaps I can meet **Elizabeth** at 12:00 PM in Nob Hill. After that, maybe **Brian** at North Beach at 1:10 PM. Then, **Kenneth** at Chinatown at 2:00 PM. Next, **Anthony** at Pacific Heights at 3:00 PM. After that, **Ashley** at Haight-Ashbury at 3:40 PM. Then, **Deborah** at Union Square at 6:00 PM. Then, **Kimberly** at Alamo Square at 6:15 PM. Finally, **Jessica** at Golden Gate Park at 8:30 PM.\n\nWait, but I have to make sure I'm not double-booking myself. Let me check the travel times between these meetings. From Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill, that's 11 minutes. From Nob Hill to North Beach, that's 8 minutes. From North Beach to Chinatown, that's 6 minutes. From Chinatown to Pacific Heights, that's 22 minutes. From Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury, that's 11 minutes. From Haight-Ashbury to Union Square, that's 19 minutes. From Union Square to Alamo Square, that's 14 minutes. From Alamo Square to Golden Gate Park, that's 9 minutes. That seems manageable.\n\nBut I also need to make sure that each meeting has the required minimum time. For example, meeting Richard for 60 minutes, starting at 11:30 AM and ending at 12:30 PM. Then, Elizabeth from 12:00 PM to 1:15 PM. Brian from 1:10 PM to 2:10 PM. Kenneth from 2:00 PM to 3:45 PM. Anthony from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. Ashley from 3:40 PM to 4:30 PM. Deborah from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Kimberly from 6:15 PM to 6:60 PM. Jessica from 8:30 PM to 9:45 PM.\n\nWait, that seems a bit tight. Maybe I need to adjust some times. Perhaps I can meet Richard at 11:00 AM, but then I have to leave Bayview by 10:35 AM, which is possible. Then, Elizabeth at 12:00 PM, Brian at 1:10 PM, Kenneth at 2:00 PM, Anthony at 3:00 PM, Ashley at 3:40 PM, Deborah at 6:00 PM, Kimberly at 6:15 PM, and Jessica at 8:30 PM.\n\nI think that works. I need to make sure each meeting is at least the required duration and that I have enough time to travel between locations. It's a bit packed, but I think it's doable.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"Richard\", \"start_time\": \"11:00\", \"end_time\": \"12:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Nob Hill\", \"person\": \"Elizabeth\", \"start_time\": \"12:15\", \"end_time\": \"13:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"13:10\", \"end_time\": \"14:10\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"14:40\", \"end_time\": \"15:50\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\", \"person\": \"Anthony\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Haight-Ashbury\", \"person\": \"Ashley\", \"start_time\": \"16:20\", \"end_time\": \"17:10\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Union Square\", \"person\": \"Deborah\", \"start_time\": \"18:00\", \"end_time\": \"19:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Kimberly\", \"start_time\": \"18:30\", \"end_time\": \"19:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Jessica\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"21:45\"}\n  ]\n}",

Travel time from Bayview to Alamo Square is 16 minutes, so I can leave at 5:59 PM to arrive by 6:15 PM.\n\n**Jessica** is at Golden Gate Park from 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM. She needs 105 minutes. If I meet her at 8:30 PM, that's a good time. Travel time from Bayview to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes, so I can leave at 8:08 PM to arrive by 8:30 PM.\n\n**Anthony** is at Pacific Heights from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. He needs 30 minutes. If I meet him at 3:00 PM, that's a good time. Travel time from Bayview to Pacific Heights is 23 minutes, so I can leave at 2:37 PM to arrive by 3:00 PM.\n\nNow, considering all these, I need to make sure I don't overbook myself. I have to leave enough time between meetings for travel. Starting from Bayview, my first meeting is with **Richard** at Fisherman's Wharf at 11:30 AM. Then, perhaps I can meet **Elizabeth** at 12:00 PM in Nob Hill. After that, maybe **Brian** at North Beach at 1:10 PM. Then, **Kenneth** at Chinatown at 2:00 PM. Next, **Anthony** at Pacific Heights at 3:00 PM. After that, **Ashley** at Haight-Ashbury at 3:40 PM. Then, **Deborah** at Union Square at 6:00 PM. Then, **Kimberly** at Alamo Square at 6:15 PM. Finally, **Jessica** at Golden Gate Park at 8:30 PM.\n\nWait, but I have to make sure I'm not double-booking myself. Let me check the travel times between these meetings. From Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill, that's 11 minutes. From Nob Hill to North Beach, that's 8 minutes. From North Beach to Chinatown, that's 6 minutes. From Chinatown to Pacific Heights, that's 22 minutes. From Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury, that's 11 minutes. From Haight-Ashbury to Union Square, that's 19 minutes. From Union Square to Alamo Square, that's 14 minutes. From Alamo Square to Golden Gate Park, that's 9 minutes. That seems manageable.\n\nBut I also need to make sure that each meeting has the required minimum time. For example, meeting Richard for 60 minutes, starting at 11:30 AM and ending at 12:30 PM. Then, Elizabeth from 12:00 PM to 1:15 PM. Brian from 1:10 PM to 2:10 PM. Kenneth from 2:00 PM to 3:45 PM. Anthony from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. Ashley from 3:40 PM to 4:30 PM. Deborah from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Kimberly from 6:15 PM to 6:60 PM. Jessica from 8:30 PM to 9:45 PM.\n\nWait, that seems a bit tight. Maybe I need to adjust some times. Perhaps I can meet Richard at 11:00 AM, but then I have to leave Bayview by 10:35 AM, which is possible. Then, Elizabeth at 12:00 PM, Brian at 1:10 PM, Kenneth at 2:00 PM, Anthony at 3:00 PM, Ashley at 3:40 PM, Deborah at 6:00 PM, Kimberly at 6:15 PM, and Jessica at 8:30 PM.\n\nI think that works. I need to make sure each meeting is at least the required duration and that I have enough time to travel between locations. It's a bit packed, but I think it's doable.\n</think>\n\nSOLUTION:"
