They all need to meet for half an hour on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Each of them has some blocked times, so I need to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's busy times to see where the overlaps are.\n\n- **Gregory**: Blocked from 9:00 to 9:30 and 11:30 to 12:00.\n- **Jonathan**: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n- **Barbara**: Has meetings from 10:00 to 10:30 and 13:30 to 14:00.\n- **Jesse**: Busy from 10:00 to 11:00 and 12:30 to 14:30.\n- **Alan**: Blocked from 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00.\n- **Nicole**: Busy from 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, and 14:00 to 17:00.\n- **Catherine**: Blocked from 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot where none of these times overlap for anyone.\n\nLet's go through the day step by step:\n\n- **9:00 to 9:30**: Gregory, Jonathan, Nicole, and Catherine are busy. So, this slot is out.\n- **9:30 to 10:00**: Alan is busy. So, this slot is also unavailable.\n- **10:00 to 10:30**: Barbara, Jesse, Nicole, and Catherine are busy. Not available.\n- **10:30 to 11:00**: Jesse is busy. Not available.\n- **11:00 to 11:30**: Alan is busy until 11:00, but from 11:00 to 11:30, Alan is free. However, Nicole is busy from 11:30 to 12:00, so we need to check if 11:00 to 11:30 works. Let's see:\n  - Gregory: Free\n  - Jonathan: Free\n  - Barbara: Free\n  - Jesse: Free until 12:30\n  - Alan: Free after 11:00\n  - Nicole: Free until 11:30\n  - Catherine: Free until 12:00\n  So, 11:00 to 11:30 seems to work for everyone.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Nicole is busy starting at 11:30, so the meeting needs to end by 11:30. If we schedule from 11:00 to 11:30, that fits perfectly without overlapping any busy times.\n\nLet me make sure there's no overlap:\n\n- **Gregory**: Free\n- **Jonathan**: Free\n- **Barbara**: Free\n- **Jesse**: Free\n- **Alan**: Free after 11:00\n- **Nicole**: Free until 11:30\n- **Catherine**: Free until 12:00\n\nYes, 11:00 to 11:30 works for everyone. I think that's the earliest available slot that fits all their schedules.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:00:11:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
