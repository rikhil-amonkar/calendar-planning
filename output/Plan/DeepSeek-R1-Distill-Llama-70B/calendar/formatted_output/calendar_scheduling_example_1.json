I need to find a time that works for everyone, considering their busy schedules and preferences.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's availability to see where they have free slots.\n\nStarting with Raymond:\n- Blocked times: 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30.\n- So, Raymond is free during: 9:30-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00.\n\nNext, Billy:\n- Meetings: 10:00-10:30, 12:00-13:00, 16:30-17:00.\n- Billy is free during: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-16:30.\n\nDonald:\n- Meetings: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 16:00-17:00.\n- Donald is free during: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-16:00.\n\nNow, I'll look for overlapping free times when all three are available.\n\nLooking at Raymond's free slots and comparing with Billy and Donald:\n\n1. 9:30-10:00:\n   - Raymond is free.\n   - Billy is free until 10:00.\n   - Donald is free from 9:30-10:00.\n   - This slot works for all three.\n\n2. 11:00-12:00:\n   - Raymond is free.\n   - Billy is free until 12:00.\n   - Donald is free from 11:00-12:00.\n   - This slot also works.\n\n3. 13:00-14:00:\n   - Raymond is free until 15:00.\n   - Billy is free until 16:30.\n   - Donald is free from 13:00-14:00.\n   - This slot works.\n\n4. 14:30-15:00:\n   - Raymond is free from 15:30-17:00.\n   - Billy is free until 16:30.\n   - Donald is free until 16:00.\n   - This slot works.\n\n5. 15:30-16:00:\n   - Raymond is free from 15:30-17:00.\n   - Billy is free until 16:30.\n   - Donald is free until 16:00.\n   - This slot works.\n\nNow, considering Billy's preference to avoid meetings after 15:00, the best slots would be earlier in the day.
