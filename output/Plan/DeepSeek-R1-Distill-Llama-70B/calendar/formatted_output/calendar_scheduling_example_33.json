The meeting should be half an hour long, and there are some constraints.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each person's schedule:\n\n- **Lisa** is busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:30-13:00, and 16:00-16:30. So, she's free between 13:00-16:00, excluding her busy times.\n  \n- **Bobby** is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, and 15:00-15:30. He prefers not to have meetings after 15:00. So, his available times are between 12:00-15:00, avoiding his busy slots.\n\n- **Randy** is busy from 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:30, and 16:00-16:30. He's free between 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:30, and after 15:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that works for all three.\n\nLooking at their availability:\n\n- **13:00-13:30**: Lisa is free, Bobby is free until 15:00, and Randy is busy until 13:30. So, 13:00-13:30 might work, but Randy is busy until 13:30.\n\n- **14:00-14:30**: Lisa is free, Bobby is free, and Randy is free between 13:30-14:30. So, 14:00-14:30 seems like a good slot.\n\n- **15:00-15:30**: Lisa is free, Bobby prefers not to meet after 15:00, and Randy is busy until 15:30. So, this slot might not work for Bobby.\n\n- **12:00-12:30**: Lisa is busy until 12:30, so that's out.\n\n- **15:30-16:00**: Lisa is free, Bobby avoids meetings after 15:00, and Randy is free after 15:30. But Bobby's preference makes this less ideal.\n\nSo, the best time that fits everyone's schedule and preferences is 14:00-14:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:00:14:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
