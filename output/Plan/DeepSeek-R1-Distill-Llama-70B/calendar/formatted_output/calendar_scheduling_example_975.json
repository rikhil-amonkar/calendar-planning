            "raw_model_response": "Alright, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. So, we need to schedule a one-hour meeting between Nicole and Daniel from Monday to Friday, and we have their availability for each day. The goal is to find the earliest possible time that works for both of them.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at Nicole's schedule. She has meetings on Tuesday at 16:00-16:30, Wednesday at 15:00-15:30, and Friday at 12:00-12:30 and 15:30-16:00. So, Nicole is relatively free on Monday and Thursday, with some availability on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, but those days have specific time slots booked.\n\nNext, I'll look at Daniel's schedule. He has a pretty packed schedule throughout the week. On Monday, he's busy from 9:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, and 14:00-16:30. On Tuesday, he's busy during 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. Wednesday is also busy with meetings from 9:00-10:00, 11:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, and 16:30-17:00. Thursday, he's busy from 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, and 15:00-15:30. On Friday, he has meetings from 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a time where both Nicole and Daniel are free. Starting with Monday, Nicole is free except for her meetings, but Daniel is quite busy on Monday. His first available slot on Monday might be after 16:30, but let's confirm.\n\nLooking at Tuesday, Nicole is busy at 16:00-16:30, and Daniel is busy until 16:30 as well. So, maybe there's a slot before 16:00. However, Daniel has a lot of meetings throughout the day, so it's tricky.\n\nWednesday, Nicole is busy at 15:00-15:30, and Daniel is also busy until 16:30. Maybe after 16:30? But Daniel is busy again at 16:30-17:00.\n\nThursday, Nicole's schedule isn't specified, but assuming she's free, and Daniel has some availability. Specifically, Daniel is free from 9:00-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 14:00-15:00, and 15:30-16:30. Nicole, not having any meetings mentioned for Thursday, might be available during these times.\n\nGiven that the group wants to meet at their earliest availability, Thursday seems promising. The earliest slot where both are free would be 9:00-10:00. That seems to work for both Nicole and Daniel, as Nicole doesn't have meetings on Thursday, and Daniel is free from 9:00-11:00.\n\nSo, the earliest available time that works for both is Thursday at 9:00-10:00.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:00:10:00}\", \"day\": \"Thursday\"}",
