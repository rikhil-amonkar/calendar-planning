So, we need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 that works for Andrew, Grace, and Samuel. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the availability for each person:\n\n- **Andrew**: His calendar is completely open all day. So, he's available from 9:00 to 17:00 without any breaks.\n- **Grace**: She also has no meetings the entire day, so her availability mirrors Andrew's.\n- **Samuel**: He has several blocked times:\n  - 9:00 to 10:30\n  - 11:30 to 12:00\n  - 13:00 to 13:30\n  - 14:00 to 16:00\n  - 16:30 to 17:00\n\nSince Andrew and Grace are available all day, the main constraints come from Samuel's blocked times. Our task is to find a 30-minute window where Samuel is free, and then ensure that this time also works for Andrew and Grace, which it will since they're available all day.\n\nLet's break down Samuel's availability by looking at his free slots:\n\n1. **10:30 to 11:30**: This is a 60-minute window. Since we need only 30 minutes, this slot works.\n2. **12:00 to 13:00**: Another 60-minute window.\n3. **13:30 to 14:00**: This is a 30-minute window, which fits our requirement exactly.\n4. **16:00 to 16:30**: Another 30-minute window.\n\nNow, considering the group wants to meet at their earliest availability, we should pick the earliest possible time that fits all criteria.\n\nLooking at the free slots for Samuel:\n\n- The first available slot starts at 10:30. However, we need to check if this slot is free for everyone else, which it is since Andrew and Grace are available all day.\n- The next slot is at 12:00, which is later than 10:30.\n- The 13:30 slot is even later.\n- The 16:00 slot is the latest.\n\nSince the group prefers the earliest availability, 10:30 to 11:00 seems like the best option. It\u2019s the first available slot after Samuel\u2019s initial busy period and fits the 30-minute requirement.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure there are no overlaps or issues. From 10:30 to 11:00, Samuel is free, and Andrew and Grace are also available. This slot doesn't conflict with any of their schedules.\n\nTherefore, the proposed meeting time is from 10:30 to 11:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
