            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to schedule a half-hour meeting for Emily, Mason, Maria, Carl, David, and Frank on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Each person has their own schedule, so I need to find a time slot where none of them have any meetings or blocks.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times:\n\nEmily:\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nMason:\n- Free all day.\n\nMaria:\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 14:00-14:30\n\nCarl:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:30-12:30\n- 13:30-14:00\n- 14:30-15:30\n- 16:00-17:00\n\nDavid:\n- 9:30-11:00\n- 11:30-12:00\n- 12:30-13:30\n- 14:00-15:00\n- 16:00-17:00\n\nFrank:\n- 9:30-10:30\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 12:30-13:30\n- 14:30-17:00\n\nI think the best approach is to look for a 30-minute window where all are free. Let me break down the day into possible slots.\n\nStarting from 9:00 to 9:30: But Carl is busy from 9:30, so maybe 9:00-9:30? Let's check others.\n\nAt 9:00-9:30:\n- Emily is free.\n- Mason is free.\n- Maria is free.\n- Carl is free until 9:30, so 9:00-9:30 is free for him.\n- David is busy until 9:30, so 9:00-9:30 is blocked for David.\n- Frank is busy until 10:30, so 9:00-9:30 is blocked for Frank.\n\nSo, David and Frank are busy then. Not possible.\n\nNext, after 9:30, let's look at 9:30-10:00. But Carl is busy until 10:00, so that's not possible.\n\nFrom 10:00-10:30: Emily is busy, so no.\n\n10:30-11:00: Maria is busy, and Carl is busy until 12:30, so no.\n\n11:00-11:30: Frank is busy, and David is busy until 11:30.\n\n11:30-12:00: David is busy, Carl is busy until 12:30, so no.\n\n12:00-12:30: Carl is busy until 12:30, so no.\n\n12:30-13:00: Carl is busy until 13:30, Frank is busy until 13:30, David is busy until 13:30. So, no.\n\n13:00-13:30: Everyone except Carl, Frank, and David is busy. So no.\n\n13:30-14:00: Carl is busy until 14:00, Frank is busy from 14:30, David is busy until 15:00. So, maybe 13:30-14:00?\n\nWait, let me check each person at 13:30-14:00:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free until 14:00.\nCarl: Busy until 14:00, so 13:30-14:00 is the end of his meeting. So he's busy until 14:00, so he's free at 14:00. So 13:30-14:00 might not work because Carl is busy until 14:00.\n\nWait, Carl's schedule: 13:30-14:00 is a meeting. So he's busy until 14:00. So 13:30-14:00 is taken for Carl.\n\nSo, next slot: 14:00-14:30.\n\nAt 14:00-14:30:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Busy from 14:00-14:30.\nCarl: Free after 14:00 (his last meeting ends at 14:00).\nDavid: Busy until 15:00, so 14:00-14:30 is blocked.\nFrank: Busy from 14:30 onwards.\n\nSo Maria and David are busy, so no.\n\nNext, 14:30-15:00.\n\nAt 14:30-15:00:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free after 14:30.\nCarl: Busy until 15:30.\nDavid: Busy until 15:00, so 14:30-15:00 is blocked.\nFrank: Busy from 14:30 onwards.\n\nSo Carl, David, Frank are busy. Not possible.\n\n15:00-15:30:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Busy until 15:30.\nDavid: Free after 15:00.\nFrank: Busy until 17:00.\n\nSo Carl is busy until 15:30, Frank is busy. So no.\n\n15:30-16:00:\n\nEmily: Free until 16:00.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Free after 15:30.\nDavid: Free after 15:00.\nFrank: Busy until 17:00.\n\nSo Frank is busy, so no.\n\n16:00-16:30:\n\nEmily: Busy from 16:00-16:30.\nCarl: Busy from 16:00-17:00.\nDavid: Busy from 16:00-17:00.\nFrank: Busy until 17:00.\n\nSo multiple people are busy here.\n\n16:30-17:00:\n\nEmily: Free after 16:30.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Busy until 17:00.\nDavid: Busy until 17:00.\nFrank: Busy until 17:00.\n\nSo Carl, David, Frank are busy.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a slot earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, maybe between 12:30-13:00? But Carl, Frank, and David are busy then.\n\nWait, what about 11:30-12:00? Let me check:\n\n11:30-12:00:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Busy until 12:30.\nDavid: Busy until 12:00, so 11:30-12:00 is blocked for David.\nFrank: Busy until 11:30, so 11:30-11:30 is the end, so 11:30-12:00 is free for Frank.\n\nWait, David is busy until 12:00, so 11:30-12:00 is blocked for David. So no.\n\nWhat about 12:00-12:30? Carl is busy until 12:30, so no.\n\nWait, maybe 15:30-16:00? Let me check:\n\n15:30-16:00:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Busy until 15:30, so 15:30-16:00 is the end of his meeting. So he's free at 15:30.\nDavid: Free after 15:00.\nFrank: Busy until 17:00.\n\nSo Frank is busy, so no.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a slot earlier. Let me try to list all possible 30-minute slots and see which ones are free for everyone.\n\nPossible slots:\n\n9:00-9:30: David and Frank busy.\n9:30-10:00: Carl busy.\n10:00-10:30: Emily busy.\n10:30-11:00: Maria and Carl busy.\n11:00-11:30: Frank busy.\n11:30-12:00: David busy.\n12:00-12:30: Carl busy.\n12:30-13:00: Carl, Frank, David busy.\n13:00-13:30: Carl, Frank, David busy.\n13:30-14:00: Carl busy until 14:00.\n14:00-14:30: Maria and David busy.\n14:30-15:00: Carl, David, Frank busy.\n15:00-15:30: Carl busy until 15:30.\n15:30-16:00: Frank busy.\n16:00-16:30: Emily, Carl, David, Frank busy.\n16:30-17:00: Carl, David, Frank busy.\n\nWait, that seems like every slot is taken. But the problem says there's a solution. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check each person's schedule again.\n\nEmily: 10:00-10:30 and 16:00-16:30.\n\nMason: Free all day.\n\nMaria: 10:30-11:00 and 14:00-14:30.\n\nCarl: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n\nDavid: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00.\n\nFrank: 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:30, 14:30-17:00.\n\nWait, perhaps 15:30-16:00 is free for everyone except Frank. But Frank is busy until 17:00, so that's no good.\n\nWait, maybe 12:30-13:00? Let's check:\n\n12:30-13:00:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Busy until 13:30? Wait, Carl's schedule: 13:30-14:00 is a meeting, so before that, he's free? Wait, no, Carl has 10:30-12:30, then 13:30-14:00. So between 12:30-13:30, is he free?\n\nWait, Carl's schedule: 10:30-12:30, then 13:30-14:00. So from 12:30 to 13:30, he's free except for 13:30-14:00. So 12:30-13:00 is free for Carl.\n\nDavid: Busy until 13:30, so 12:30-13:00 is within his busy time (12:30-13:30). So David is busy.\n\nFrank: Busy from 12:30-13:30, so he's busy.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is blocked by David and Frank.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check 15:00-15:30 again.\n\n15:00-15:30:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Busy until 15:30.\nDavid: Free after 15:00.\nFrank: Busy until 17:00.\n\nSo Carl is busy until 15:30, Frank is busy. So no.\n\nWait, maybe 13:00-13:30? Let's check:\n\n13:00-13:30:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Free (since his next meeting is at 13:30).\nDavid: Busy until 13:30.\nFrank: Busy until 13:30.\n\nSo David and Frank are busy until 13:30, so 13:00-13:30 is blocked.\n\nWait, maybe 15:30-16:00 is the only possible slot, but Frank is busy. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in Carl's schedule. Let me check again.\n\nCarl's meetings:\n\n9:30-10:00,\n10:30-12:30,\n13:30-14:00,\n14:30-15:30,\n16:00-17:00.\n\nSo between 12:30-13:30, he's free except for 13:30-14:00. So 12:30-13:30 is free except the last half hour.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is free for Carl.\n\nSimilarly, 15:30-16:00: Carl is free because his last meeting ends at 15:30.\n\nWait, but Frank is busy from 14:30-17:00, so 15:30-16:00 is within that. So Frank is busy.\n\nWait, is there any slot where Frank is free? Let me see Frank's schedule:\n\n9:30-10:30,\n11:00-11:30,\n12:30-13:30,\n14:30-17:00.\n\nSo Frank is free from 13:30-14:30, except his last meeting starts at 14:30.\n\nSo 13:30-14:30 is free for Frank except 14:30 onwards.\n\nSo maybe 13:30-14:00 is busy for Carl, but 14:00-14:30 is busy for Maria and David.\n\nWait, perhaps 14:30-15:00 is busy for Carl, David, and Frank.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach: find the times when all are free.\n\nLet me list each person's free times.\n\nEmily's free times:\n\n9:00-10:00,\n10:30-16:00,\n16:30-17:00.\n\nMason's free all day: 9:00-17:00.\n\nMaria's free times:\n\n9:00-10:30,\n11:00-14:00,\n14:30-17:00.\n\nCarl's free times:\n\n9:00-9:30,\n10:00-10:30,\n12:30-13:30,\n14:00-14:30,\n15:30-16:00.\n\nDavid's free times:\n\n9:00-9:30,\n11:00-11:30,\n12:00-12:30,\n13:30-14:00,\n15:00-16:00.\n\nFrank's free times:\n\n9:00-9:30,\n10:30-11:00,\n13:30-14:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot that overlaps in all these free times.\n\nLooking for overlap:\n\nLet me see:\n\nEmily: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nMason: all day.\n\nMaria: 9:00-10:30, 11:00-14:00, 14:30-17:00.\n\nCarl: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00.\n\nDavid: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-16:00.\n\nFrank: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 13:30-14:30.\n\nLooking for a 30-minute slot where all have free time.\n\nLet me check each possible slot:\n\n9:00-9:30: Everyone except Emily, Mason, Maria, Carl, David, Frank? Wait, no, Emily is free from 9:00-10:00, so yes. But David is free 9:00-9:30, Frank 9:00-9:30. So 9:00-9:30 is free for all except checking each:\n\nEmily: Yes.\nMason: Yes.\nMaria: Yes (9:00-10:30).\nCarl: Yes (9:00-9:30).\nDavid: Yes (9:00-9:30).\nFrank: Yes (9:00-9:30).\n\nWait, this seems to work. But earlier I thought David and Frank were busy, but maybe I was mistaken.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nAt 9:00-9:30:\n\nEmily: Free (9:00-10:00).\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free (9:00-10:30).\nCarl: Free (9:00-9:30).\nDavid: Free (9:00-9:30).\nFrank: Free (9:00-9:30).\n\nYes, everyone is free! So 9:00-9:30 is a possible slot.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought David and Frank were busy, but looking at their schedules:\n\nDavid is blocked during 9:30-11:00, so 9:00-9:30 is before that, so he's free.\n\nFrank has a meeting from 9:30-10:30, so 9:00-9:30 is before that, so he's free.\n\nSo yes, 9:00-9:30 works for everyone.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, I thought 9:00-9:30 was blocked because David and Frank were busy, but that's incorrect. They are busy starting at 9:30, so 9:00-9:30 is free.\n\nSo the solution is 9:00-9:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:00:09:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to schedule a half-hour meeting for Emily, Mason, Maria, Carl, David, and Frank on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00.

So he's busy until 14:00, so he's free at 14:00. So 13:30-14:00 might not work because Carl is busy until 14:00.\n\nWait, Carl's schedule: 13:30-14:00 is a meeting. So he's busy until 14:00. So 13:30-14:00 is taken for Carl.\n\nSo, next slot: 14:00-14:30.\n\nAt 14:00-14:30:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Busy from 14:00-14:30.\nCarl: Free after 14:00 (his last meeting ends at 14:00).\nDavid: Busy until 15:00, so 14:00-14:30 is blocked.\nFrank: Busy from 14:30 onwards.\n\nSo Maria and David are busy, so no.\n\nNext, 14:30-15:00.\n\nAt 14:30-15:00:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free after 14:30.\nCarl: Busy until 15:30.\nDavid: Busy until 15:00, so 14:30-15:00 is blocked.\nFrank: Busy from 14:30 onwards.\n\nSo Carl, David, Frank are busy.

But the problem says there's a solution. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check each person's schedule again.\n\nEmily: 10:00-10:30 and 16:00-16:30.\n\nMason: Free all day.\n\nMaria: 10:30-11:00 and 14:00-14:30.\n\nCarl: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n\nDavid: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 16:00-17:00.\n\nFrank: 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:30, 14:30-17:00.\n\nWait, perhaps 15:30-16:00 is free for everyone except Frank. But Frank is busy until 17:00, so that's no good.\n\nWait, maybe 12:30-13:00? Let's check:\n\n12:30-13:00:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Busy until 13:30? Wait, Carl's schedule: 13:30-14:00 is a meeting, so before that, he's free? Wait, no, Carl has 10:30-12:30, then 13:30-14:00. So between 12:30-13:30, is he free?\n\nWait, Carl's schedule: 10:30-12:30, then 13:30-14:00. So from 12:30 to 13:30, he's free except for 13:30-14:00. So 12:30-13:00 is free for Carl.\n\nDavid: Busy until 13:30, so 12:30-13:00 is within his busy time (12:30-13:30). So David is busy.\n\nFrank: Busy from 12:30-13:30, so he's busy.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is blocked by David and Frank.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check 15:00-15:30 again.\n\n15:00-15:30:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Busy until 15:30.\nDavid: Free after 15:00.\nFrank: Busy until 17:00.\n\nSo Carl is busy until 15:30, Frank is busy. So no.\n\nWait, maybe 13:00-13:30? Let's check:\n\n13:00-13:30:\n\nEmily: Free.\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free.\nCarl: Free (since his next meeting is at 13:30).\nDavid: Busy until 13:30.\nFrank: Busy until 13:30.\n\nSo David and Frank are busy until 13:30, so 13:00-13:30 is blocked.\n\nWait, maybe 15:30-16:00 is the only possible slot, but Frank is busy. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in Carl's schedule. Let me check again.\n\nCarl's meetings:\n\n9:30-10:00,\n10:30-12:30,\n13:30-14:00,\n14:30-15:30,\n16:00-17:00.\n\nSo between 12:30-13:30, he's free except for 13:30-14:00. So 12:30-13:30 is free except the last half hour.\n\nSo 12:30-13:00 is free for Carl.\n\nSimilarly, 15:30-16:00: Carl is free because his last meeting ends at 15:30.\n\nWait, but Frank is busy from 14:30-17:00, so 15:30-16:00 is within that. So Frank is busy.\n\nWait, is there any slot where Frank is free? Let me see Frank's schedule:\n\n9:30-10:30,\n11:00-11:30,\n12:30-13:30,\n14:30-17:00.\n\nSo Frank is free from 13:30-14:30, except his last meeting starts at 14:30.\n\nSo 13:30-14:30 is free for Frank except 14:30 onwards.\n\nSo maybe 13:30-14:00 is busy for Carl, but 14:00-14:30 is busy for Maria and David.\n\nWait, perhaps 14:30-15:00 is busy for Carl, David, and Frank.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach: find the times when all are free.\n\nLet me list each person's free times.\n\nEmily's free times:\n\n9:00-10:00,\n10:30-16:00,\n16:30-17:00.\n\nMason's free all day: 9:00-17:00.\n\nMaria's free times:\n\n9:00-10:30,\n11:00-14:00,\n14:30-17:00.\n\nCarl's free times:\n\n9:00-9:30,\n10:00-10:30,\n12:30-13:30,\n14:00-14:30,\n15:30-16:00.\n\nDavid's free times:\n\n9:00-9:30,\n11:00-11:30,\n12:00-12:30,\n13:30-14:00,\n15:00-16:00.\n\nFrank's free times:\n\n9:00-9:30,\n10:30-11:00,\n13:30-14:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot that overlaps in all these free times.\n\nLooking for overlap:\n\nLet me see:\n\nEmily: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nMason: all day.\n\nMaria: 9:00-10:30, 11:00-14:00, 14:30-17:00.\n\nCarl: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00.\n\nDavid: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-16:00.\n\nFrank: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 13:30-14:30.\n\nLooking for a 30-minute slot where all have free time.\n\nLet me check each possible slot:\n\n9:00-9:30: Everyone except Emily, Mason, Maria, Carl, David, Frank? Wait, no, Emily is free from 9:00-10:00, so yes. But David is free 9:00-9:30, Frank 9:00-9:30. So 9:00-9:30 is free for all except checking each:\n\nEmily: Yes.\nMason: Yes.\nMaria: Yes (9:00-10:30).\nCarl: Yes (9:00-9:30).\nDavid: Yes (9:00-9:30).\nFrank: Yes (9:00-9:30).\n\nWait, this seems to work. But earlier I thought David and Frank were busy, but maybe I was mistaken.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nAt 9:00-9:30:\n\nEmily: Free (9:00-10:00).\nMason: Free.\nMaria: Free (9:00-10:30).\nCarl: Free (9:00-9:30).\nDavid: Free (9:00-9:30).\nFrank: Free (9:00-9:30).\n\nYes, everyone is free! So 9:00-9:30 is a possible slot.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought David and Frank were busy, but looking at their schedules:\n\nDavid is blocked during 9:30-11:00, so 9:00-9:30 is before that, so he's free.\n\nFrank has a meeting from 9:30-10:30, so 9:00-9:30 is before that, so he's free.\n\nSo yes, 9:00-9:30 works for everyone.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, I thought 9:00-9:30 was blocked because David and Frank were busy, but that's incorrect. They are busy starting at 9:30, so 9:00-9:30 is free.\n\nSo the solution is 9:00-9:30 on Monday.\n</think>",
