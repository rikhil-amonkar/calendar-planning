They want the earliest possible time that works for both of them. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Bobby's schedule:\n\n- **Monday:** Bobby is busy from 14:30 to 15:00.\n- **Tuesday:** Bobby is busy from 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 17:00.\n\nSo, on Monday, Bobby is free before 14:30 and after 15:00. On Tuesday, Bobby has a lot of busy periods, with some free slots potentially in the late afternoon.\n\nNow, let's look at Michael's schedule:\n\n- **Monday:** Michael is busy from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 17:00.\n- **Tuesday:** Michael is busy from 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nSo, on Monday, Michael is free between 13:30 to 14:00 and 15:00 to 15:30. On Tuesday, Michael is free between 14:00 to 15:00 and 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nThe goal is to find the earliest possible time that both are free. Let's check Monday first since that's the first day in the range.\n\nOn Monday:\n\n- Bobby is free before 14:30 and after 15:00.\n- Michael is free between 13:30 to 14:00 and 15:00 to 15:30.\n\nLooking for overlapping times:\n\n- Between 13:30 to 14:00, Bobby is free, and Michael is free. So, they could meet from 13:30 to 14:00.\n\nThat seems to work. But let's also check Tuesday to see if there's an earlier time.\n\nOn Tuesday:\n\n- Bobby is free after 15:00 (since he's busy until 15:00).\n- Michael is free between 14:00 to 15:00 and 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nSo, the earliest they could meet on Tuesday is 14:00 to 14:30, but Bobby isn't free until after 15:00. So, the earliest on Tuesday would be 15:00 to 15:30.\n\nComparing both days, Monday at 13:30 to 14:00 is earlier than Tuesday's 15:00 to 15:30. Therefore, Monday at 13:30 to 14:00 is the earliest possible time that works for both.\n\nI should also double-check if there are any preferences or constraints I missed. The group wants the earliest availability, and there are no other preferences mentioned. So, Monday at 13:30 to 14:00 seems to be the best option.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{13:30:14:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
