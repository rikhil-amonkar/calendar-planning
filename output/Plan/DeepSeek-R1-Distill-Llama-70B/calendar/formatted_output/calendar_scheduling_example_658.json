            "raw_model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this meeting scheduling problem step by step. I need to find a time for Shirley and Albert to meet for half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nFirst, I'll look at Shirley's availability. On Monday, her calendar is blocked from 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, and 16:00 to 16:30. On Tuesday, she's blocked from 9:30 to 10:00. Shirley prefers not to meet on Tuesday after 10:30, so her latest availability on Tuesday would be before 10:30.\n\nNow, let's check Albert's schedule. On Monday, he's busy the entire day from 9:00 to 17:00. That means Monday is completely out of the question for him. On Tuesday, he's busy from 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, the only potential slots on Tuesday when Albert is free are from 12:30 to 13:00 and 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nConsidering Shirley's constraints, she doesn't want to meet on Tuesday after 10:30, which eliminates the 16:00 to 16:30 slot. The only remaining time on Tuesday when both are available is from 12:30 to 13:00. However, Shirley is free during this time, and Albert is also available then.\n\nWait a minute, I need to double-check. Shirley is blocked on Tuesday from 9:30 to 10:00, but she's free after that until 10:30. Since she prefers not to meet after 10:30 on Tuesday, the earliest available slot would be right after her blocked time. From 10:00 to 10:30, Shirley is free, and Albert is busy until 11:00. So, actually, the earliest they can meet is at 11:00, but Albert is busy until 11:00, so the next available slot would be after 11:00.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Albert is busy from 9:30 to 11:00 on Tuesday, so he's free from 11:00 to 11:30. Shirley is free from 10:00 to 10:30 and then from 12:30 onwards, but she doesn't want to meet after 10:30. So, the only overlapping time when both are free and within Shirley's preferred time is from 10:00 to 10:30. But Albert is busy until 11:00, so that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try again. On Tuesday, Albert is free from 11:00 to 11:30, but Shirley prefers not to meet after 10:30, so that slot is too late for her. The next available slot for both would be after Albert's 11:30 to 12:30 meeting, which is from 12:30 to 13:00. Shirley is free then, and Albert is also free. So, 12:30 to 13:00 on Tuesday seems to be the best option.\n\nBut wait, Shirley doesn't want to meet after 10:30 on Tuesday, so 12:30 is after that. Does that mean she won't accept it? The problem says she prefers not to meet after 10:30, but it's not a strict constraint. Since there's no earlier time that works for both, I think 12:30 to 13:00 is acceptable.\n\nSo, the proposed time is 12:30 to 13:00 on Tuesday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:30:13:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}",
