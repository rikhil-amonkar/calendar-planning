            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to schedule a 30-minute meeting for Adam, John, Stephanie, and Anna on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Anna prefers not to meet before 14:30, so I should focus on times after that.\n\nFirst, let me list everyone's busy times:\n\n- **Adam**: Busy from 14:00 to 15:00.\n- **John**: Busy at 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n- **Stephanie**: Busy from 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n- **Anna**: Busy from 9:30-10:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-15:30, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nSince Anna doesn't want to meet before 14:30, I'll look for slots starting at 14:30 or later.\n\nLet's check each possible 30-minute slot after 14:30:\n\n1. **14:30-15:00**:\n   - Adam is busy until 15:00, so this slot won't work.\n\n2. **15:00-15:30**:\n   - Adam is free after 15:00.\n   - John is free between 14:30-15:30 (since his busy times are at 15:30-16:00).\n   - Stephanie is busy until 16:00, so she's not available.\n   - Anna is busy until 15:30, so she's not available.\n\n   Since both Stephanie and Anna are busy, this slot doesn't work.\n\n3. **15:30-16:00**:\n   - Adam is free.\n   - John is busy from 15:30-16:00, so he's not available.\n   - Stephanie is busy until 16:00.\n   - Anna is free after 15:30.\n\n   John and Stephanie are busy, so this slot is out.\n\n4. **16:00-16:30**:\n   - Adam is free.\n   - John is busy from 16:30-17:00, so he's free until then.\n   - Stephanie is busy until 16:00, but free after that.\n   - Anna is busy from 16:30-17:00, so she's free until 16:30.\n\n   This slot works for everyone except Anna, who is busy at 16:30. So, it's not suitable.\n\n5. **16:30-17:00**:\n   - Adam is free.\n   - John is busy during this slot.\n   - Stephanie is busy until 17:00.\n   - Anna is busy as well.\n\n   Multiple conflicts here, so this slot is not viable.\n\nIt seems like there's no slot after 14:30 that works for everyone. Maybe I missed something. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back at **15:00-15:30**:\n\n- Adam: Free after 15:00.\n- John: Free between 14:30-15:30.\n- Stephanie: Busy until 16:00.\n- Anna: Busy until 15:30.\n\nSince Stephanie and Anna are busy, this slot still doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each person's availability again.\n\n- **Adam**: Only busy from 14:00-15:00. So, from 15:00 onwards, he's free.\n- **John**: Busy at 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So, he's free from 14:30-15:30 and 16:00-16:30.\n- **Stephanie**: Busy from 11:30-16:00 and 16:30-17:00. So, she's free from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n- **Anna**: Busy from 9:30-10:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-15:30, and 16:30-17:00. So, she's free from 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, and 15:30-16:30.\n\nGiven Anna's preference to not meet before 14:30, her available slots are from 15:30-16:30.\n\nLooking for a 30-minute slot within 15:30-16:30 that works for everyone:\n\n- **15:30-16:00**:\n  - Adam: Free.\n  - John: Busy from 15:30-16:00.\n  - Stephanie: Busy until 16:00.\n  - Anna: Free.\n\n  John and Stephanie are busy, so this doesn't work.\n\n- **16:00-16:30**:\n  - Adam: Free.\n  - John: Free until 16:30.\n  - Stephanie: Free from 16:00-16:30.\n  - Anna: Free until 16:30.\n\n  This slot works for everyone except Anna, who is busy at 16:30. So, it's not suitable.\n\nWait, Anna is busy from 16:30-17:00, but the meeting would end at 16:30, so it might still be possible. However, since Anna prefers not to meet before 14:30, but this is at 16:00, which is after her preferred time. So, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nBut considering her busy time starts at 16:30, the meeting would end right when she becomes busy. It's a bit tight, but it might work.\n\nAlternatively, is there another slot?\n\nLooking back, there's no other slot after 14:30 that fits everyone's availability.\n\nSo, the best option is **16:00-16:30** on Monday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{16:00:16:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
