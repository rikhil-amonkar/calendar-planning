So, we need to find a time for Arthur and Michael to meet for half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. \n\nFirst, let's look at their schedules.\n\n**Arthur's Schedule:**\n- **Monday:** 11:00-11:30, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30\n- **Tuesday:** 13:00-13:30, 16:00-16:30\n- **Wednesday:** 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 14:00-14:30, 16:00-16:30\n\n**Michael's Schedule:**\n- **Monday:** 9:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-17:00\n- **Tuesday:** 9:30-11:30, 12:00-13:30, 14:00-15:30\n- **Wednesday:** 10:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30\n\nNow, let's note the constraints:\n1. Arthur cannot meet on Tuesday.\n2. They want to meet at their earliest availability.\n\nSince Arthur is unavailable on Tuesday, we'll focus on Monday and Wednesday.\n\n**Monday:**\n- Arthur is free before 11:00, then busy until 11:30, then free again from 11:30 to 13:30, busy until 14:00, free until 15:00, busy until 15:30, and then free after that.\n- Michael is busy from 9:00 to 12:00, then from 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 17:00.\n\nLooking for overlapping free times on Monday:\n- From 9:00 to 11:00, Michael is busy, so no overlap.\n- From 11:30 to 12:00: Arthur is free, but Michael is busy until 12:00.\n- From 12:00 to 12:30: Michael is free until 12:30, but Arthur is busy until 13:30.\n- From 14:30 to 15:00: Both have a window here. Arthur is free from 14:00 to 15:00, and Michael is free from 14:30 to 15:00. So, 14:30 to 15:00 is a possible slot.\n\n**Wednesday:**\n- Arthur is free from 9:00 to 10:00, then busy until 10:30, free again until 11:00, busy until 11:30, free until 12:00, busy until 12:30, free until 14:00, busy until 14:30, free until 16:00, busy until 16:30, and free after that.\n- Michael is busy from 10:00 to 12:30, then free from 12:30 to 13:00, busy again until 13:30.\n\nLooking for overlapping free times on Wednesday:\n- From 9:00 to 10:00: Arthur is free, but Michael is busy until 10:00.\n- From 10:30 to 11:00: Arthur is free, but Michael is busy until 12:30.\n- From 12:30 to 13:00: Michael is free, but Arthur is busy until 14:00.\n- From 14:30 to 16:00: Arthur is free from 14:30 to 16:00, but Michael is busy until 13:30 and then free. However, Michael's schedule isn't provided beyond 13:30, so we'll assume he's free after that. But since Arthur is free from 14:30 onwards, they could meet then.\n\nComparing both days, Monday offers an earlier slot at 14:30, while Wednesday's earliest possible time would be after 14:30 as well. Since they prefer the earliest availability, Monday's 14:30 to 15:00 slot works best.\n\nSo, the proposed meeting time is from 14:30 to 15:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
