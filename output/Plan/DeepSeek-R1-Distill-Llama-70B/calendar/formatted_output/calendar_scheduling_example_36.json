Let me look at their schedules to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, let's list out their availability:\n\n- **Ryan** is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 and from 12:30 to 13:00. So, he's free from 9:30 to 12:30 and then from 13:00 to 17:00.\n\n- **Ruth** has no meetings all day, so she's available anytime between 9:00 and 17:00.\n\n- **Denise** is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, and 14:30 to 16:30. She's free from 10:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:30, and after 16:30.\n\nNow, Denise doesn't want to meet after 12:30, so we need to find a time before 12:30 that works for everyone.\n\nLooking at the overlapping free times:\n\n- From 10:30 to 12:00, both Ryan and Denise are free, and Ruth is available.\n\n- From 13:00 to 14:30, Ryan and Denise are free, but since Denise can't meet after 12:30, we can't use this slot.\n\nSo, the best time is between 10:30 and 12:00. Since the meeting is one hour long, let's pick 10:30 to 11:30. That way, everyone is available and it fits within Denise's constraint of not meeting after 12:30.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30:11:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
