The goal is to find a 30-minute time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday that works for both Ryan and Adam, considering their constraints.\n\nFirst, let's list out the availability for both individuals across the three days.\n\n**Ryan's Schedule:**\n- **Monday:** Busy from 9:30-10:00, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:30-16:00.\n- **Tuesday:** Busy from 11:30-12:30, 15:30-16:00.\n- **Wednesday:** Busy from 12:00-13:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\n**Adam's Schedule:**\n- **Monday:** Busy from 9:00-10:30, 11:00-13:30, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n- **Tuesday:** Busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00.\n- **Wednesday:** Busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\n**Constraints:**\n1. Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday.\n2. Adam wants to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:30.\n3. The meeting should be scheduled on Tuesday if possible.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's analyze each day:\n\n**Monday:**\n- Ryan is free from 10:00-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-15:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n- Adam is free from 10:30-11:00, 13:30-14:00, and 16:00-16:30.\n- The overlapping free slots are 10:30-11:00 and 16:00-16:30.\n- However, Adam wants to avoid meetings before 14:30 on Monday, so 10:30-11:00 is out. That leaves 16:00-16:30.\n\n**Tuesday:**\n- Ryan is free from 9:00-11:30, 12:30-15:30, and 16:00-15:30 (typo here, likely 16:00-17:00).\n- Adam is free from 10:00-10:30, 15:30-16:00.\n- The overlapping free slot is 10:00-10:30 and 15:30-16:00.\n- Since the preference is to schedule on Tuesday if possible, 10:00-10:30 is a good option.\n\n**Wednesday:**\n- Ryan is available from 9:00-12:00, 13:00-15:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n- Adam is available from 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n- The overlapping free slots are 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n- However, Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday, so we can ignore this day.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe earliest availability that satisfies all constraints is on Tuesday at 10:00-10:30.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:00:10:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}",
