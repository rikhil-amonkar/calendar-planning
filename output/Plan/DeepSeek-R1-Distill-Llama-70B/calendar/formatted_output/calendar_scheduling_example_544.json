            "raw_model_response": "Okay, so I need to help schedule a meeting between Deborah and Albert on Monday. The meeting should be half an hour long, between 9:00 and 17:00. Let me see what I have to work with here.\n\nFirst, Deborah is completely free the entire day. That\u2019s great because it means her availability isn\u2019t a constraint. The main challenge is Albert's schedule. He has blocked times: 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, and 15:00 to 16:30. Plus, he can\u2019t meet after 11:00. Hmm, that\u2019s an important point.\n\nSo, let me break this down. Albert is busy from 9:00 to 10:00, so that\u2019s the first hour of the day. Then he\u2019s free from 10:00 to 10:30. After that, he\u2019s busy again from 10:30 to 12:00. But wait, he can\u2019t meet after 11:00, so even though he\u2019s busy until 12:00, we have to stop considering times after 11:00.\n\nThat means the available slots we should look at are between 10:00 and 11:00. Because after 11:00, Albert is either busy or unavailable. Deborah is free all day, so she\u2019s good anytime.\n\nThe meeting needs to be 30 minutes long. So, I need to find a 30-minute window between 10:00 and 11:00 where Albert is free. Let\u2019s see:\n\nFrom 10:00 to 10:30, Albert is free. That\u2019s a 30-minute window. Perfect. So, scheduling the meeting from 10:00 to 10:30 would work.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. Is there any other time? Let me see. After 10:30, Albert is busy until 12:00, but we can\u2019t go beyond 11:00. So, 10:00 to 10:30 is the only viable option.\n\nI think that\u2019s the best fit. It\u2019s within Albert\u2019s available time, doesn\u2019t conflict with his blocked periods, and fits within the 9:00 to 17:00 work hours. Plus, it\u2019s before 11:00, so it meets all the constraints.\n\nSo, the proposed time should be from 10:00 to 10:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:00:10:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
