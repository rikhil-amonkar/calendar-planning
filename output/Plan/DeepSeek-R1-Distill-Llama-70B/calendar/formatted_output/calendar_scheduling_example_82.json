So, we need to find a 30-minute time slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 that works for Michael, Eric, and Arthur. \n\nFirst, let's list out each person's availability:\n\n- **Michael** is busy during:\n  - 9:30 to 10:30\n  - 15:00 to 15:30\n  - 16:00 to 16:30\n\n- **Eric** is free all day, so his availability is wide open from 9:00 to 17:00.\n\n- **Arthur** is busy during:\n  - 9:00 to 12:00\n  - 13:00 to 15:00\n  - 15:30 to 16:00\n  - 16:30 to 17:00\n\nNow, to find a time that works for everyone, I need to look for a 30-minute window where none of them have conflicts.\n\nLet's break down the day into possible time slots:\n\n1. **9:00 to 9:30**: Arthur is busy, so this slot is out.\n\n2. **9:30 to 10:30**: Michael is busy, so this slot is out.\n\n3. **10:30 to 12:00**: Arthur is busy until 12:00, so this slot is partially blocked.\n\n4. **12:00 to 13:00**: Arthur is free from 12:00 to 13:00. Let's check Michael and Eric. Michael is free during this time, and Eric is always free. So, 12:00 to 12:30 is a possible slot.\n\n5. **13:00 to 15:00**: Arthur is busy again, so this entire period is out.\n\n6. **15:00 to 15:30**: Michael is busy, so this slot is out.\n\n7. **15:30 to 16:00**: Arthur is busy, so this slot is out.\n\n8. **16:00 to 16:30**: Michael is busy, so this slot is out.\n\n9. **16:30 to 17:00**: Arthur is busy, so this slot is out.\n\nFrom this breakdown, the only viable time slot that works for everyone is from 12:00 to 12:30.
