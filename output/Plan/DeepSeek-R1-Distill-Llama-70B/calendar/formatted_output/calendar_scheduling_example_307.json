Let me start by listing each person's busy times.\n\nRonald is free all day, so I don't need to worry about him.\n\nStephen is busy from 10:00-10:30 and 12:00-12:30. So his available times are before 10:00, between 10:30 and 12:00, and after 12:30 until 17:00.\n\nBrittany is busy at 11:00-11:30, 13:30-14:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. So her available times are before 11:00, between 11:30 and 13:30, 14:00-15:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nDorothy is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-12:30, 13:00-15:00, and 15:30-17:00. So she's free between 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, and 15:00-15:30.\n\nRebecca is busy from 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, and 13:00-17:00. So her available times are before 9:30, between 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, and 12:30-13:00.\n\nJordan is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-15:00, and 15:30-16:30. So he's free between 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 15:00-15:30, and after 16:30 until 17:00.\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot where all of them are free. Let's look for overlapping available times.\n\nLooking at each person's available slots:\n\n- Between 9:30-10:00: Dorothy and Jordan are free. Others are either free or have availability here. Let me check each person at this time:\n  - Ronald: Free\n  - Stephen: Free (since he's busy at 10:00, so before that is free)\n  - Brittany: Free (her first busy is at 11:00)\n  - Dorothy: Free from 9:30-10:00\n  - Rebecca: Busy until 9:30, so at 9:30-10:00, she's busy until 9:30, so from 9:30 onwards she's free? Wait, Rebecca is busy from 9:30-10:30, so she's busy during 9:30-10:30. So she's not free at 9:30-10:00. So this slot doesn't work.\n\nNext, check between 10:30-11:00. Let's see who's available here.\n\n- Stephen is free after 10:30 until 12:00, so yes.\n- Brittany is free until 11:00, so 10:30-11:00 is available for her.\n- Dorothy is free from 10:30-11:00.\n- Rebecca is free between 10:30-11:00.\n- Jordan is busy until 11:00, so at 10:30-11:00, he's busy until 11:00. So he's not available here. So this slot doesn't work.\n\nNext, check between 11:30-12:00. Let's see:\n\n- Stephen is free until 12:00, so 11:30-12:00 is okay.\n- Brittany is free from 11:30 onwards, so she's available.\n- Dorothy is busy until 12:30, so she's busy here.\n- Rebecca is free between 11:30-12:00.\n- Jordan is free from 11:00-11:30, so at 11:30 he's busy again until 12:00. So he's busy here. So this slot doesn't work.\n\nNext, check between 12:30-13:00. Let's see:\n\n- Stephen is free after 12:30.\n- Brittany is free until 13:30, so yes.\n- Dorothy is free from 12:30-13:00.\n- Rebecca is free until 13:00, so she's available.\n- Jordan is busy from 13:00-15:00, so he's busy at 13:00. But 12:30-13:00 is before that, so he's free. Wait, Jordan's busy times are 13:00-15:00, so 12:30-13:00 is just before that. So he's available here.\n\nWait, let me double-check Jordan's schedule: he's busy from 13:00-15:00, so 12:30-13:00 is free. So all except Dorothy? Wait, Dorothy is free from 12:30-13:00. So yes, Dorothy is available.\n\nSo let's check each person at 12:30-13:00:\n\n- Ronald: Free\n- Stephen: Free (he's busy until 12:30, so 12:30-13:00 is the end of his busy time. Wait, Stephen is busy from 12:00-12:30, so after 12:30 he's free. So yes, available.\n- Brittany: Free\n- Dorothy: Free\n- Rebecca: Free until 13:00\n- Jordan: Free\n\nSo this slot works. It's a 30-minute window from 12:30 to 13:00.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Rebecca is busy from 13:00-17:00, so she's available until 13:00. So 12:30-13:00 is okay for her.\n\nYes, this seems to be a suitable time.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:30:13:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
