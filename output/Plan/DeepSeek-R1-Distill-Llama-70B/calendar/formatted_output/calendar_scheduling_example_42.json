The meeting should be one hour long, and it has to fit within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each person's schedule to see when they're free.\n\nStarting with Julie:\n- Blocked times: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 16:00-17:00.\n- So, Julie is free from 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-16:00.\n\nNext, Sean:\n- Meetings on Monday: 9:00-9:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n- Sean is free from 9:30-13:00, 13:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nNow, Lori:\n- Busy times: 10:00-10:30, 11:00-13:00, 15:30-17:00.\n- Lori is free from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 13:00-15:30.\n\nTo find a common time, I'll look for overlapping free slots in all three schedules.\n\nLooking at Julie's free times:\n1. 9:30-11:00\n2. 11:30-12:00\n3. 12:30-13:30\n4. 14:00-16:00\n\nSean's free times:\n1. 9:30-13:00\n2. 13:30-15:00\n3. 15:30-16:00\n4. 16:30-17:00\n\nLori's free times:\n1. 9:00-10:00\n2. 10:30-11:00\n3. 13:00-15:30\n\nNow, let's find overlaps.\n\n- Between 9:30-10:00: Julie and Sean are free, but Lori is busy until 10:00.\n- 10:00-10:30: Julie is free, Sean is free, but Lori is busy.\n- 10:30-11:00: Julie is free, Sean is free, Lori is free. This is a possible slot, but it's only 30 minutes, and we need an hour.\n- 11:00-11:30: Julie is busy, so no.\n- 11:30-12:00: Julie is free, Sean is free, Lori is busy until 13:00.\n- 12:00-12:30: Julie is busy.\n- 12:30-13:30: Julie is free, Sean is free, Lori is busy until 13:00, so from 13:00-13:30, Lori is free.
