The goal is to find a 30-minute time slot on Monday that works for all participants: Walter, Cynthia, Ann, Catherine, and Kyle. \n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's availability throughout the day.\n\n**Walter** is completely free all day, so he doesn't impose any constraints.\n\n**Cynthia** is busy during:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 10:00 to 10:30\n- 13:30 to 14:30\n- 15:00 to 16:00\n\n**Ann** is busy during:\n- 10:00 to 11:00\n- 13:00 to 13:30\n- 14:00 to 15:00\n- 16:00 to 16:30\n\n**Catherine** is busy during:\n- 9:00 to 11:30\n- 12:30 to 13:30\n- 14:30 to 17:00\n\n**Kyle** is busy during:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 10:00 to 11:30\n- 12:00 to 12:30\n- 13:00 to 14:30\n- 15:00 to 16:00\n\nNow, I'll look for overlapping free times in their schedules.\n\nStarting from 9:00 AM:\n- 9:00 to 9:30: Walter is free, but Cynthia and Kyle are busy.\n- 9:30 to 10:00: Walter is free, Cynthia is free, Ann is free, Catherine is busy until 11:30, Kyle is free. So, only Catherine is busy here.\n\nMoving on, let's check the next available slot after 10:00 AM:\n- 10:00 to 10:30: Cynthia is busy, so this slot is out.\n\nNext, 10:30 to 11:00:\n- Walter, Cynthia, Ann, and Kyle are free, but Catherine is busy until 11:30.\n\nFrom 11:00 to 11:30:\n- Walter, Cynthia, Ann, and Kyle are free, but Catherine is still busy.\n\nAt 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM:\n- Walter, Cynthia, Ann, and Kyle are free, and Catherine becomes free after 11:30. This seems like a potential slot.\n\nHowever, I'll continue checking to ensure there are no better options.\n\n12:00 to 12:30:\n- Walter is free, Cynthia is free, Ann is free, Catherine is busy until 12:30, Kyle is busy until 12:30. So, Catherine and Kyle are busy here.\n\n12:30 to 13:00:\n- Walter is free, Cynthia is free, Ann is free, Catherine is busy until 13:30, Kyle is free. Catherine is still busy.\n\n13:00 to 13:30:\n- Walter is free, Cynthia is free, Ann is busy, Catherine is busy, Kyle is busy.
