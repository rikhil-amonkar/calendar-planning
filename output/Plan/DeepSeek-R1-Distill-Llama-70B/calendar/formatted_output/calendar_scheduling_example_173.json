Also, Harold doesn't want to meet after 13:00, which is 1 PM. So, I need to find a time that works for all four of them within these constraints.\n\nFirst, I should look at each person's schedule to see when they're free. Let's list out their busy times:\n\n- **Jacqueline**:\n  - 9:00 to 9:30\n  - 11:00 to 11:30\n  - 12:30 to 13:00\n  - 15:30 to 16:00\n\n- **Harold**:\n  - 10:00 to 10:30\n  - 13:00 to 13:30\n  - 15:00 to 17:00\n\n- **Arthur**:\n  - 9:00 to 9:30\n  - 10:00 to 12:30\n  - 14:30 to 15:00\n  - 15:30 to 17:00\n\n- **Kelly**:\n  - 9:00 to 9:30\n  - 10:00 to 11:00\n  - 11:30 to 12:30\n  - 14:00 to 15:00\n  - 15:30 to 16:00\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot where none of them have meetings. Also, since Harold doesn't want to meet after 13:00, we have to look before that.\n\nLet's break down the day into possible time slots and see where there's overlap in their availability.\n\n**From 9:00 to 10:00:**\n- Jacqueline is busy from 9:00 to 9:30.\n- Arthur is busy from 9:00 to 9:30.\n- Kelly is busy from 9:00 to 9:30.\n- So, from 9:30 to 10:00, Jacqueline, Arthur, and Kelly are free, but Harold is busy from 10:00 to 10:30.\n\n**From 10:00 to 11:00:**\n- Harold is busy until 10:30.\n- Kelly is busy until 11:00.\n- So, maybe from 10:30 to 11:00, but Harold is still busy until 10:30, and Kelly is busy until 11:00.\n\n**From 11:00 to 12:00:**\n- Jacqueline is busy from 11:00 to 11:30.\n- Kelly is busy from 11:30 to 12:30.\n- So, from 11:30 to 12:00, Jacqueline is free, but Kelly is busy.\n\n**From 12:00 to 13:00:**\n- Jacqueline is busy from 12:30 to 13:00.\n- Arthur is busy until 12:30.\n- Kelly is busy from 11:30 to 12:30.\n- So, maybe from 12:30 to 13:00, but Jacqueline is busy then.\n\n**After 13:00:**\n- Harold doesn't want to meet after 13:00, so we can't consider times after that.\n\nIt seems like the only possible time that overlaps and fits all constraints is between 14:30 and 15:00, but wait, let's double-check.\n\nWait, actually, from 14:30 to 15:00:\n\n- Jacqueline is free (her next busy time is at 15:30).\n- Harold is busy from 15:00 to 17:00, so 15:00 is when he becomes busy.\n- Arthur is busy from 14:30 to 15:00.\n- Kelly is busy from 14:00 to 15:00.\n\nSo, actually, 14:30 to 15:00 doesn't work because Arthur and Kelly are busy.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's try to find another slot.\n\nWhat about 13:00 to 13:30?\n\n- Harold is busy from 13:00 to 13:30.\n- So that's out.\n\nWhat about 12:30 to 13:00?\n\n- Jacqueline is busy from 12:30 to 13:00.\n- So that's out.\n\nWhat about 11:30 to 12:00?\n\n- Kelly is busy from 11:30 to 12:30.\n- So that's out.\n\nWhat about 10:30 to 11:00?\n\n- Harold is busy until 10:30.\n- Kelly is busy until 11:00.\n- So, 10:30 to 11:00 might work.\n\nLet's check:\n\n- At 10:30 to 11:00:\n  - Jacqueline: Free (she's busy from 11:00 to 11:30).\n  - Harold: Busy until 10:30, so free after that.\n  - Arthur: Busy until 12:30.\n  - Kelly: Busy until 11:00.\n\nWait, Arthur is busy until 12:30, so he's busy at 10:30 to 11:00.\n\nSo, Arthur is busy then. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe there's no 30-minute slot that works for everyone before 13:00.\n\nWait, did I miss something? Let me check again.\n\nFrom 9:30 to 10:00:\n\n- Jacqueline: Free\n- Arthur: Free (busy until 9:30)\n- Kelly: Free (busy until 9:30)\n- Harold: Busy from 10:00 to 10:30\n\nSo, from 9:30 to 10:00, Harold is busy starting at 10:00, so 9:30 to 10:00 might be possible.\n\nBut is that a 30-minute slot? 9:30 to 10:00 is only 30 minutes, but does everyone have that time free?\n\n- Jacqueline: Yes\n- Arthur: Yes\n- Kelly: Yes\n- Harold: Busy from 10:00 to 10:30, but 9:30 to 10:00 is before that, so he's free.\n\nWait, Harold is busy from 10:00 to 10:30, but 9:30 to 10:00 is before that, so he's free during that time.\n\nSo, 9:30 to 10:00 seems to work for everyone.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- **Jacqueline**: Free from 9:30 to 11:00, except 11:00 to 11:30.\n- **Harold**: Busy from 10:00 to 10:30, so 9:30 to 10:00 is free.\n- **Arthur**: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, so 9:30 to 10:00 is free.\n- **Kelly**: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, so 9:30 to 10:00 is free.\n\nYes, that works. So the proposed time is 9:30 to 10:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:30:10:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
