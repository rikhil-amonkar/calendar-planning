Let's see, I have their schedules here. \n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's availability and see where there's an overlap. \n\nStarting with Emily, she's busy from 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30. So her free times are between 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:30-14:00, 15:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nMelissa is busy from 9:30-10:00 and 14:30-15:00. So her free times are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-14:30, and 15:00-17:00.\n\nFrank has blocked times: 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:30, 15:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. So his free times are 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that works for all three. Let's look for overlapping free times.\n\nLooking at the morning:\n\n- Between 9:00-9:30: Emily is free, Melissa is free until 9:30, and Frank is free until 10:00. So 9:00-9:30 is a possible slot.\n\n- 9:30-10:00: Emily is free, Melissa is busy, Frank is free. So not all three are free.\n\n- 10:00-10:30: Emily is busy, Melissa is free, Frank is busy. Not good.\n\n- 10:30-11:00: Emily is free, Melissa is free, Frank is free. This is another possible slot.\n\n- 11:00-11:30: Emily is free, Melissa is free, Frank is busy. Not good.\n\n- 11:30-12:30: Emily is busy, Melissa is free, Frank is free. Not all three.\n\n- 12:30-14:00: Emily is free, Melissa is free, Frank is free until 13:00, then busy until 13:30, then free again until 14:30. So maybe 13:30-14:00? But Emily is free until 14:00, Melissa is free until 14:30, Frank is busy 13:30-14:30. Hmm, tricky.\n\n- 14:00-15:00: Emily is busy, Melissa is busy until 14:30, Frank is busy until 14:30. So maybe 14:30-15:00? Emily is busy until 15:00, so no.\n\n- 15:00-16:00: Emily is free, Melissa is free, Frank is busy until 16:00. So 15:00-16:00 is partially free for Frank.\n\n- 16:00-16:30: Emily is busy, Melissa is free, Frank is free. Not all three.\n\n- 16:30-17:00: Emily is free, Melissa is free, Frank is busy. Not good.\n\nSo the best options are 9:00-9:30 and 10:30-11:00.\n\nBut Frank doesn't want to meet after 9:30, so 10:30-11:00 is out. Therefore, the earliest available time that works for everyone is 9:00-9:30.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:00:09:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
