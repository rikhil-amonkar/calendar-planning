So, we need to schedule a meeting for Betty and Scott, and it has to be half an hour long between 9:00 and 17:00, from Monday to Thursday. There's a lot to consider here, but I'll break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Betty's availability. She's busy on:\n- Monday: 10:00-10:30, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n- Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 16:30-17:00\n- Wednesday: 9:30-10:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30\n- Thursday: 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:30-17:00\n\nAnd Scott's availability:\n- Monday: 9:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n- Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 16:00-16:30\n- Wednesday: 9:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n- Thursday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n\nNow, Betty can't meet on Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday before 15:00. Scott wants to avoid more meetings on Wednesday. So, we need to find a time that fits both of their schedules and respects these preferences.\n\nLet's go day by day.\n\n**Monday:**\n- Betty is busy from 10:00 onwards, so that's out.\n- Scott is busy from 9:30 to 15:00, so the earliest they could meet is after 15:00, but Betty is busy at 15:00-15:30 and 16:00-16:30. The only slot left is 16:30-17:00, but Scott is busy then too. So, no go on Monday.\n\n**Tuesday:**\n- Betty is busy until 9:30, and then has free time from 9:30 to 11:30, but she's busy again at 11:30-12:00, and so on. Scott is busy from 9:00-9:30 and then from 10:00 onwards. The only possible slot might be between 9:30-10:00, but Scott is busy then. So, Tuesday seems tricky.\n\n**Wednesday:**\n- Betty is free in the morning from 10:30-13:00, but Scott is busy until 12:30. So, maybe 13:00-13:30? But Betty is busy at 13:00-13:30. The next slot could be 14:30-15:00, but Scott is busy until 14:30. After that, Betty is free from 15:00 onwards, but Scott is busy at 15:00-15:30. The next possible time is 15:30-16:00, but Scott is busy again. So, Wednesday isn't working.\n\n**Thursday:**\n- Betty is free from 10:00-11:30, except for 11:30-12:00. Scott is busy until 10:30, then free from 10:30-11:00, but Betty is free from 10:00-11:30. So, maybe 10:30-11:00? That's a half-hour slot. Let me double-check:\n  - Betty: 10:00-11:30 is free except 11:30-12:00, so 10:30-11:00 is good.\n  - Scott: 10:00-10:30 is busy, but 10:30-11:00 is free.\n  \nSo, 10:30-11:00 on Thursday works for both, and it's after 15:00, respecting Betty's constraints. Scott also avoids Wednesday, which he wanted.\n\nI think that's the best option.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Thursday\"}",
