Both have some busy times, so I need to carefully look at their schedules to find a slot that works for both.\n\nFirst, let's break down their availability.\n\n**Jean's Schedule:**\n- **Monday:** No specific meetings mentioned, so presumably free all day.\n- **Tuesday:** Busy from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n\n**Doris's Schedule:**\n- **Monday:** Busy from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n- **Tuesday:** Fully booked from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\n\nAlso, Doris prefers not to meet on Monday after 2:00 PM.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Meeting duration: 30 minutes.\n- Preferred days: Monday or Tuesday.\n- Doris prefers not to meet on Monday after 2:00 PM.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Monday:**\n   - Doris is busy from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM.\n   - Free slot: 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM (but only 30 minutes, which fits our meeting duration).\n   - However, Doris is busy again from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM.\n   - Next, she's busy from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM, which is a large block.\n   - She's free from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM, but she prefers not to meet after 2:00 PM on Monday, so this slot is out.\n   - After 4:30 PM, she's busy until 5:00 PM.\n\n2. **Tuesday:**\n   - Jean is busy from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n   - Doris is fully booked all day on Tuesday.\n\nGiven these constraints, the only feasible time that works for both Jean and Doris is on Monday from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM. This slot is within Doris's preferred time frame (before 2:00 PM) and doesn't conflict with Jean's schedule on Tuesday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:30:12:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
