The goal is to find the earliest possible time they're all available.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's availability:\n\n1. **Denise**:\n   - Blocked times: 12:00 to 12:30 and 15:30 to 16:00.\n   - Available times: 9:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00.\n\n2. **Angela**:\n   - No meetings all day.\n   - Available times: 9:00 to 17:00.\n\n3. **Natalie**:\n   - Blocked times: 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 17:00.\n   - Available times: 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 15:00.\n\nNow, I need to find overlapping times when all three are available.\n\nLet's break down the day into segments and check where their available times overlap:\n\n- **9:00 to 11:30**: Natalie is busy, so this slot is out.\n- **11:30 to 12:00**: Natalie is free. Denise is free, and Angela is free. This seems like a possible slot.\n- **12:00 to 12:30**: Denise is busy, so this slot is out.\n- **12:30 to 13:00**: Denise is free, Angela is free, but Natalie is busy until 13:00.\n- **13:00 to 14:00**: Natalie is free, Denise is free, Angela is free. This is another possible slot.\n- **14:00 to 14:30**: Natalie is busy, so this slot is out.\n- **14:30 to 15:00**: Natalie is free, Denise is free, Angela is free. Another possible slot.\n- **15:00 to 17:00**: Natalie is busy, so this slot is out.\n\nFrom the above, the overlapping available times are:\n\n1. **11:30 to 12:00**\n2. **13:00 to 14:00**\n3. **14:30 to 15:00**\n\nSince the group wants to meet at their earliest availability, the first available slot is **11:30 to 12:00**.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:30:12:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
