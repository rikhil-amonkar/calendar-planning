Let's break down their availability.\n\nStarting with Monday:\n- Diane is busy from 12:00 to 12:30 and 15:00 to 15:30.\n- Matthew is busy from 9:00 to 10:00 and 10:30 onwards all day.\nSo, on Monday, the only possible time they're both free is between 10:00 and 10:30, but Matthew is busy from 10:30 onwards, so that slot is too short. No availability on Monday.\n\nMoving to Tuesday:\n- Diane is busy from 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, and 16:00 to 17:00.\n- Matthew is fully booked all day.\nNo availability on Tuesday.\n\nWednesday:\n- Diane is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 14:30 to 15:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n- Matthew is busy from 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 14:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. He prefers not to meet before 12:30.\nLooking for a slot after 12:30:\nFrom 14:30 to 15:00, Diane is busy, so the next possible time is 15:00 to 16:00. Matthew is free from 14:30 to 16:00, and Diane is free from 15:00 to 16:30. So, 15:00 to 16:00 works for both.\n\nThursday:\n- Diane is busy from 15:30 to 16:30.\n- Matthew is busy until 16:00.\nPossible slot from 16:00 to 17:00, but Diane is free then. However, Wednesday has a better earlier slot.\n\nFriday:\n- Diane is busy from 9:30 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 17:00.\n- Matthew is fully booked all day.\nNo availability on Friday.\n\nSo, the earliest and best slot is Wednesday from 15:00 to 16:00.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{15:00:16:00}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}",
