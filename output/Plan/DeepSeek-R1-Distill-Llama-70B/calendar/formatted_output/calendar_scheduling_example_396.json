The goal is to find a time that works for everyone, and I know there's a solution that fits everyone's schedule.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's busy times to see where the free slots might be.\n\nAndrea is free all day, so she's not a constraint. That's helpful.\n\nJack has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30 and from 14:00 to 14:30. So, he's busy during those times but free otherwise.\n\nMadison is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, she's got a few blocks in the morning and late afternoon.\n\nRachel is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. She has a lot of meetings scattered throughout the day.\n\nDouglas is busy from 9:00 to 11:30 and from 12:00 to 16:30. So, he's only free between 11:30 to 12:00 and after 16:30.\n\nRyan is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 14:00, and 14:30 to 17:00. So, he's free in the late morning and early afternoon, except for those blocked times.\n\nNow, I'll try to find overlapping free times for all of them.\n\nLet's break down the day into possible slots:\n\n1. 9:00 to 9:30: Jack and Ryan are busy, so not possible.\n2. 9:30 to 10:30: Madison and Rachel are busy.\n3. 10:30 to 11:00: Andrea is free, Jack is free, Madison is free, Rachel is free, Douglas is busy until 11:30, Ryan is free. So, Douglas is busy until 11:30, so this slot might not work because Douglas isn't available until 11:30.\n\nWait, Douglas is busy until 11:30, so from 10:30 to 11:00, he's still busy. So, that slot is out.\n\n4. 11:00 to 11:30: Rachel is busy, so that's out.\n5. 11:30 to 12:00: Andrea is free, Jack is free, Madison is free, Rachel is free, Douglas is free (since he's busy until 11:30, but this slot starts at 11:30, so maybe he's available), and Ryan is free. So, this looks like a possible slot. Let's check:\n\n- Andrea: Free\n- Jack: Free\n- Madison: Free\n- Rachel: Free\n- Douglas: Available from 11:30 onwards\n- Ryan: Free\n\nYes, 11:30 to 12:00 is a 30-minute slot that works for everyone.\n\n6. 12:00 to 13:00: Douglas is busy starting at 12:00, so that's out.\n7. 13:00 to 14:00: Madison and Ryan are busy, so out.\n8. 14:00 to 14:30: Jack is busy, so out.\n9. 14:30 to 15:00: Rachel is busy until 15:30, so out.\n10. 15:00 to 15:30: Madison is busy, so out.\n11. 15:30 to 16:00: Rachel is busy until 16:00, so out.\n12. 16:00 to 16:30: Ryan is busy until 17:00, so out.\n13. 16:30 to 17:00: Madison and Ryan are busy, so out.\n\nSo, the only slot that works is 11:30 to 12:00. That's a 30-minute window where everyone is free.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:30:12:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
