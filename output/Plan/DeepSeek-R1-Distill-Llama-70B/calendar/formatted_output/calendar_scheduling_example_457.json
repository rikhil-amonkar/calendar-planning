Let me look at each person's schedule to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nStarting with Andrea: She's busy from 9:30-10:30 and 13:30-14:30. So her available times are before 9:30, between 10:30 and 13:30, and after 14:30.\n\nRuth has blocked times: 12:30-13:00 and 15:00-15:30. So she's free otherwise.\n\nSteven is busy at 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-14:00, and 15:00-16:00. His available slots are before 10:00, between 10:30 and 11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, and after 16:00.\n\nGrace is completely free all day.\n\nKyle is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. So his available times are 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nElijah is blocked from 9:00-11:00, 11:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.

Her available times are 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:30-14:00, and after 16:00.\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot where all of them are free. Let's go through each person's available times and see where they overlap.\n\nLooking at Andrea's availability: before 9:30, 10:30-13:30, after 14:30.\n\nRuth is free except 12:30-13:00 and 15:00-15:30.\n\nSteven's available times: before 10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, after 16:00.\n\nGrace is always available.\n\nKyle's available times: 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nElijah's available times: 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nLori's available times: 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:30-14:00, after 16:00.\n\nLooking for overlapping times:\n\n- 9:30-10:00: Andrea is free, Ruth is free, Steven is free until 10:00, Grace is free, Kyle is free until 10:30, Elijah is busy until 11:00, Lori is free. So Elijah is busy here, so this slot doesn't work.\n\n- 10:30-11:00: Andrea is free, Ruth is free, Steven is free, Grace is free, Kyle is busy until 10:30, so he's free after 10:30. Elijah is busy until 11:00, Lori is busy until 11:30. So Elijah and Lori are busy here.\n\n- 11:00-11:30: Andrea is free, Ruth is free, Steven is busy until 11:00, so he's free after 11:00. Grace is free, Kyle is busy until 12:00, Elijah is free starting at 11:00, Lori is busy until 11:30. So Lori is busy here.\n\n- 11:30-12:00: Andrea is free, Ruth is free, Steven is free, Grace is free, Kyle is busy until 12:00, Elijah is free, Lori is free. Kyle is busy until 12:00, so this slot doesn't work.\n\n- 12:00-12:30: Andrea is free, Ruth is busy from 12:30, so she's free until 12:30. Steven is free until 12:30, Grace is free, Kyle is busy until 12:00, so he's free after 12:00. Elijah is busy until 13:00, Lori is busy until 13:30.

So Kyle and Lori are busy here.\n\n- 14:00-14:30: Andrea is free after 14:30, so she's busy until 14:30. Ruth is free, Steven is free, Grace is free, Kyle is busy until 15:00, Elijah is free, Lori is free. Andrea is busy here.\n\n- 15:00-15:30: Andrea is free after 14:30, Ruth is busy from 15:00-15:30, so she's busy here. Steven is busy until 15:00, so he's free after 15:00. Grace is free, Kyle is free until 15:00, so he's busy from 15:00. Elijah is free, Lori is busy until 16:00.

Kyle is busy from 16:30, so only 16:00-16:30 is possible, but Kyle is busy then.\n\nWait, I think I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at Kyle's schedule: He's busy from 15:30-16:00 and 16:30-17:00. So he's free from 16:00-16:30.\n\nSimilarly, Lori is busy until 16:00, so she's free after 16:00.\n\nElijah is free until 16:30.\n\nSteven is free after 16:00.\n\nRuth is free.\n\nGrace is free.\n\nAndrea is free.\n\nSo, 16:00-16:30 seems to work for everyone except Kyle, but Kyle is busy until 16:00, so he's free from 16:00 onwards. Wait, Kyle is busy from 15:30-16:00, so he's free at 16:00.\n\nSo, 16:00-16:30 works for everyone.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nAndrea: Free after 14:30 \u2013 yes.\n\nRuth: Free \u2013 yes.\n\nSteven: Free after 16:00 \u2013 yes.\n\nGrace: Free \u2013 yes.\n\nKyle: Free from 16:00 \u2013 yes.\n\nElijah: Free until 16:30 \u2013 yes.\n\nLori: Free after 16:00 \u2013 yes.\n\nSo, the earliest available time that works for everyone is 16:00-16:30 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{16:00:16:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
