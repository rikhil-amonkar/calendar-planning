            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I need to help Brian and Julia schedule a one-hour meeting between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM from Monday to Friday. Brian wants to avoid more meetings on Monday, so I should prioritize other days first. Let's break down their schedules to find a common free slot.\n\nStarting with Monday:\n- Brian is busy from 9:30-10:00, 12:30-14:30, and 15:30-16:00.\n- Julia is busy from 9:00-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, and 15:30-16:00.\nLooking at their availability, there's a gap from 14:30 to 15:30, but Brian is busy until 14:30. After that, both have some free time, but Brian prefers to avoid Monday. So, maybe Monday isn't the best option.\n\nMoving to Tuesday:\n- Brian is busy from 9:00-9:30.\n- Julia is busy from 13:00-14:00 and 16:00-16:30.\nThere's a potential slot from 14:00 to 15:00. Let me check if both are free then. Brian's schedule on Tuesday doesn't block this time, and Julia is free between 14:00 and 16:00, except for her busy times. So, 14:00 to 15:00 on Tuesday seems possible.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check Wednesday:\n- Brian is busy from 12:30-14:00 and 16:30-17:00.\n- Julia is busy from 9:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, and 13:00-17:00.\nIt looks like Wednesday is pretty packed for both, especially Julia who is busy most of the afternoon. So, Wednesday isn't a good option.\n\nThursday:\n- Brian is busy from 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, and 16:30-17:00.\n- Julia is busy from 9:00-10:30 and 11:00-17:00.\nLooking for a one-hour slot, maybe 10:30-11:30? But Brian is free then, and Julia is busy until 10:30. From 10:30 to 11:30, Julia is free, but Brian is busy at 11:00. So that slot is partially blocked. The next possible time would be after 13:30, but Brian is busy at 13:00-13:30 and Julia is busy until 17:00. So Thursday doesn't seem to work.\n\nFriday:\n- Brian is busy from 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n- Julia is busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, and 15:30-16:00.\nLooking for a one-hour slot, maybe 11:00-12:00? Brian is free then, and Julia is busy until 11:30. So from 11:30 to 12:30, Julia is free, but Brian is free from 11:00. So 11:30-12:30 could work, but I need to ensure both are free. Brian is free from 11:00 to 12:30 except for 11:00-11:30? Wait, no, Brian's schedule on Friday shows he's free from 11:00 to 12:30, except for 10:30-11:00. So from 11:00 to 12:30, Brian is free. Julia is busy until 11:30. So 11:30-12:30 could be a slot. But let's check if that's a full hour. Yes, 11:30-12:30 is one hour, and both are free then.\n\nBut since Brian prefers to avoid Monday, and Tuesday has an earlier slot at 14:00-15:00, which is earlier than Friday's 11:30-12:30, it's better to choose the earliest possible time. So Tuesday at 14:00-15:00 seems better.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Tuesday had a slot from 14:00 to 15:00. Let me confirm:\n\nBrian's Tuesday schedule: busy from 9:00-9:30. So from 9:30 onwards, he's free except for other commitments, but in this case, his only busy time is 9:00-9:30. So from 9:30 to 17:00, he's free except for what's listed, which is only 9:00-9:30. So 14:00-15:00 on Tuesday is free for Brian.\n\nJulia's Tuesday schedule: busy from 13:00-14:00 and 16:00-16:30. So from 14:00 to 16:00, she's free. Therefore, 14:00-15:00 works for both.\n\nSo the earliest available slot is Tuesday at 14:00-15:00.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:00:15:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}",
