Let me look at each person's availability and see where there's a common free slot.\n\nStarting with Patrick: He's busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 13:30-14:00, and 16:00-16:30. So his available times are 9:30-10:00, 10:30-13:30, 14:00-16:00, and after 16:30.\n\nKayla is busy from 12:30-13:30, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-16:30. So her free times are 9:00-12:30, 13:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and after 16:30.\n\nCarl has blocked times: 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, and 14:30-17:00. So he's free from 9:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:30, and before 9:00 or after 17:00.\n\nChristian is blocked from 9:00-12:30, 13:00-14:00, and 14:30-17:00. So he's available from 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, and after 17:00.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that fits all four. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the earliest possible time, Patrick is free at 9:30-10:00, but Kayla is free until 12:30. However, Carl isn't free until 11:00, and Christian is busy until 12:30. So that window doesn't work.\n\nNext, Patrick is free from 10:30-13:30, but Kayla is busy from 12:30 onwards. Carl is free until 12:00, then busy until 12:30, and then free again from 12:30-13:00. Christian is free from 12:30-13:00. So between 12:30-13:00, Patrick, Kayla, Carl, and Christian are all free. That's a 30-minute slot from 12:30 to 13:00.\n\nI should double-check to make sure no one has any conflicts in that time. Patrick is free, Kayla is free until 12:30, but she's busy starting at 12:30? Wait, Kayla is busy from 12:30-13:30, so she's not available at 12:30. That means the 12:30-13:00 slot won't work because Kayla is busy then.\n\nHmm, let me look again. Maybe a bit later. Patrick is free until 13:30, Kayla is busy from 12:30-13:30, so she's free after 13:30. Carl is free from 13:30-14:30, and Christian is free from 14:00-14:30. So the overlap here would be 14:00-14:30. That's a 30-minute slot where everyone is available.\n\nSo the best time is from 14:00 to 14:30.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:00:14:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
