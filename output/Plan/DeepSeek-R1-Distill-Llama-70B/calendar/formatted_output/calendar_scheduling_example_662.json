Both have some busy times, so I need to look for a slot where both are free.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Gary's schedule. On Monday, he's busy from 9:30 to 10:00, then from 11:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 16:30 to 17:00. So, the free times on Monday for Gary are 10:00 to 11:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30, and 17:00 is the end of the day.\n\nNow, looking at David's schedule on Monday, he's busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 13:00, and 14:30 to 16:30. His free times on Monday are 9:30 to 10:00, 13:00 to 14:30, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nComparing both, the overlapping free times on Monday are 13:00 to 14:00 and 16:30 to 17:00. But they need a full hour, and 16:30 to 17:00 is only 30 minutes, so that's too short. The 13:00 to 14:00 slot is exactly one hour, so that works.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check Tuesday as well. Gary is free on Tuesday from 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 14:30, and 16:00 to 17:00. David is free on Tuesday from 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nLooking for an overlapping hour on Tuesday, the only possible slot is 16:00 to 17:00, but David is only free until 16:30, so that's 30 minutes again. Therefore, Monday at 13:00 to 14:00 is the best option.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{13:00:14:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
