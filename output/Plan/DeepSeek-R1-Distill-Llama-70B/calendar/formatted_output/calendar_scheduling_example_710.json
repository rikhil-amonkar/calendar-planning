Let me go through their schedules step by step to find a time that works for both of them.\n\nFirst, let's look at Cheryl's availability:\n\n- **Monday**: She's busy from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM, and 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM.\n- **Tuesday**: She's busy from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM.\n- **Wednesday**: She's busy from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM, and 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that Cheryl cannot meet on Wednesday. So, we can eliminate Wednesday from our options. That leaves us with Monday and Tuesday.\n\nNow, let's look at Kyle's availability:\n\n- **Monday**: He's busy the entire day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\n- **Tuesday**: He's busy from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM.\n- **Wednesday**: He's busy from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, and 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nBut since Cheryl can't meet on Wednesday, we only need to consider Monday and Tuesday for Kyle as well.\n\nWait, but Kyle is busy the entire day on Monday, so we can't schedule the meeting on Monday. That leaves us with Tuesday.\n\nNow, let's focus on Tuesday. Cheryl is only busy from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM on Tuesday. Kyle is busy from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM on Tuesday.\n\nSo, the only time that Cheryl is free on Tuesday is from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, before Kyle's busy time starts at 9:30 AM.\n\nBut wait, the meeting needs to be half an hour long. If Cheryl is free from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, and Kyle is free from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM on Tuesday (since he's busy starting at 9:30 AM), that seems like a possible time slot.\n\nHowever, I need to confirm if both Cheryl and Kyle are free at the same time on Tuesday morning.\n\nCheryl's availability on Tuesday:\n\n- Free from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM (since she's only busy starting at 9:30 AM)\n- Busy from 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM\n- Free from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM\n\nKyle's availability on Tuesday:\n\n- Busy from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM\n\nWait a minute, Kyle is busy starting at 9:30 AM, but is he free before that? The problem says Kyle is busy on Tuesday from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM, which implies he is free before 9:30 AM.\n\nSo, the overlapping free time for both Cheryl and Kyle on Tuesday is from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM.\n\nThat seems to be the only available slot that works for both of them, considering Cheryl cannot meet on Wednesday and Kyle is busy on Monday.\n\nSo, the proposed meeting time would be from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM on Tuesday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:00:09:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}",
