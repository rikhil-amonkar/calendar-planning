The meeting should be half an hour long, and it needs to happen on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. There are some constraints on their schedules, and I need to make sure that the time I pick works for everyone. Plus, Helen doesn't want to meet after 13:30, so that adds another layer to consider.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each person's schedule individually to understand their availability.\n\nStarting with Margaret: She's blocked off certain times. Specifically, she's busy from 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, and 15:00 to 15:30. So, the times she's free would be between 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 15:00, and after 15:30 until the end of the workday at 17:00.\n\nNext, Donna has blocked times as well. She's busy from 14:30 to 15:00 and 16:00 to 16:30. So, her available slots are from 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nNow, Helen has meetings scheduled from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 17:00. Additionally, she doesn't want to meet after 13:30. So, her available times before 13:30 would be between 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 13:00, and 14:00 to 14:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a time that works for all three of them. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Margaret's Availability:**\n   - 12:00 to 13:00\n   - 13:30 to 15:00\n   - 15:30 to 17:00\n\n2. **Donna's Availability:**\n   - 9:00 to 14:30\n   - 15:00 to 16:00\n   - 16:30 to 17:00\n\n3. **Helen's Availability (before 13:30):**\n   - 9:30 to 10:00\n   - 11:30 to 13:00\n   - 14:00 to 14:30\n\nLooking for overlapping times:\n\n- **9:30 to 10:00:** Margaret is busy until 10:00, so this slot doesn't work for her.\n- **11:30 to 13:00:** Margaret is free from 12:00 to 13:00, so there's an overlap here from 12:00 to 13:00.\n- **14:00 to 14:30:** Margaret is busy from 13:00 to 13:30 and then free from 13:30 to 15:00, so 14:00 to 14:30 is within her available time. Donna is also free until 14:30, so this is a potential slot.\n\nHowever, Helen doesn't want to meet after 13:30, so the latest she's available is 13:30. Therefore, the 14:00 to 14:30 slot is after her preferred cutoff.\n\nLooking back at the 12:00 to 13:00 slot, this works for Margaret and Donna, and it's before 13:30, so it fits Helen's preference as well.\n\nTherefore, the best time to schedule the meeting would be from 12:00 to 13:00 on Monday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:00:13:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
