The meeting needs to be one hour long, and it has to be on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. I need to find a time that works for both of them, considering their busy schedules.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Natalie's schedule:\n\n- **Monday**: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30.\n- **Tuesday**: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00.\n- **Wednesday**: Busy from 11:00 to 11:30, 16:00 to 16:30.\n- **Thursday**: Busy from 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nNow, William's schedule:\n\n- **Monday**: Busy from 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00.\n- **Tuesday**: Busy from 9:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 16:00.\n- **Wednesday**: Busy from 9:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00.\n- **Thursday**: Busy from 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 17:00.\n\nI need to find a one-hour slot where both are free. Let's go day by day.\n\n**Monday:**\n- Natalie is busy until 9:30, then free from 9:30 to 10:00, but William is busy from 9:30 onwards.\n- From 10:00 to 12:00, Natalie is busy.\n- 12:00 to 12:30: Natalie is free, but William is busy until 11:00, then from 11:30 onwards.\n- 12:30 to 13:00: Natalie is busy.\n- 13:00 to 14:00: Natalie is free from 13:00 to 14:00, but William is busy from 13:00 to 14:00.\n- 14:00 to 14:30: Natalie is busy.\n- 14:30 to 15:00: Natalie is free until 15:00, but William is busy until 17:00.\n- 15:00 to 16:30: Natalie is busy.\n- 16:30 to 17:00: Natalie is free, but William is busy.\n\nSo, Monday doesn't seem to have any overlapping free time.\n\n**Tuesday:**\n- Natalie is busy until 9:30, then free from 9:30 to 10:00, but William is busy from 9:00 to 13:00.\n- 10:00 to 10:30: Natalie is busy.\n- 10:30 to 12:30: Natalie is free, but William is busy until 13:00.\n- 12:30 to 14:00: Natalie is busy.\n- 14:00 to 16:00: Natalie is free from 14:00 to 16:00, but William is busy until 16:00.\n- 16:00 to 17:00: Natalie is busy.\n\nNo luck on Tuesday.\n\n**Wednesday:**\n- Natalie is busy from 11:00 to 11:30 and 16:00 to 16:30.\n- William is busy from 9:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, and 16:30 to 17:00.\n- Let's check possible slots:\n  - 9:00 to 11:00: Natalie is free, but William is busy until 12:30.\n  - 12:30 to 13:00: Natalie is free, William is busy from 13:00.\n  - 14:30 to 15:30: Natalie is free, William is busy from 15:30.\n  - 16:30 to 17:00: Both are busy.\n\nNo overlapping free time on Wednesday.\n\n**Thursday:**\n- Natalie is busy from 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00.\n- William is busy from 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 17:00.\n- Possible slots:\n  - 9:00 to 10:00: Natalie is free, William is busy until 10:30.\n  - 10:30 to 11:00: Natalie is busy.\n  - 11:30 to 12:00: Natalie is busy.\n  - 12:30 to 13:00: Natalie is free, William is busy until 13:00.\n  - 14:00 to 15:00: Natalie is busy.\n  - 15:00 to 15:30: Natalie is free until 15:30, William is busy from 15:00.\n  - 16:00 to 16:30: Natalie is busy.\n\nNo overlapping free time on Thursday.\n\nWait, did I miss something? Let me double-check Thursday.\n\nFrom 14:00 to 15:00, Natalie is busy, but William is busy until 15:00. So from 15:00 to 16:00, William is busy, Natalie is busy until 15:30. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I need to look for a slot that's not covered. Wait, maybe between 16:00 and 17:00? But Natalie is busy from 16:30, and William is busy until 17:00.\n\nI'm not finding any overlapping free time. But the problem states there is a solution. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nLooking back at Thursday:\n\n- Natalie is free from 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30.\n\nWilliam is free from 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00.\n\nSo overlapping free times:\n\n- 10:30 to 11:00: Natalie is busy until 11:00, so no.\n- 11:30 to 12:00: Natalie is busy.\n- 12:30 to 13:00: Natalie is free from 12:30 to 13:00, but William is busy until 13:00.\n- 14:00 to 14:30: Natalie is busy until 14:00, William is busy until 14:00.\n- 15:00 to 15:30: Natalie is free, William is busy from 15:00.\n\nWait, maybe 14:00 to 15:00? Natalie is busy from 14:00, William is busy until 15:00.\n\nI'm still not finding it. Maybe the solution is on a different day.\n\nWait, maybe Wednesday:\n\nNatalie is free from 9:00 to 11:00, except 11:00 to 11:30.\n\nWilliam is busy from 9:00 to 12:30, so from 12:30 to 13:00, Natalie is free, but William is busy from 13:00.\n\nWait, 12:30 to 13:00 is only half an hour, but we need one hour.\n\nWait, maybe 14:30 to 15:30? Natalie is free from 14:30 to 15:00, William is busy from 15:30.\n\nNo, that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the meeting can start earlier or later. Maybe 13:00 to 14:00? Natalie is free from 13:00 to 14:00, but William is busy until 14:30.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the schedules. Let me list out the free times for both.\n\nFor Natalie:\n\n- Monday: 9:30-10:00, 13:00-14:00, 16:30-17:00\n- Tuesday: 14:00-16:00\n- Wednesday: 9:00-11:00, 14:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n- Thursday: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n\nFor William:\n\n- Monday: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 17:00-17:00\n- Tuesday: 13:00-13:30, 16:00-17:00\n- Wednesday: 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n- Thursday: 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-15:00\n\nNow, looking for overlapping times:\n\nOn Wednesday:\n\n- Natalie is free from 14:30-16:00\n- William is free from 14:30-15:30\n\nSo, 14:30-15:30 is a possible slot.\n\nYes, that works.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}",
