            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to schedule a meeting for Joshua and Joyce for half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Let's break down their availability.\n\nFirst, let's look at Monday. Joshua is free except from 15:00 to 15:30. Joyce, however, is quite busy on Monday. She's unavailable from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 17:00. So, the only possible time on Monday when both are free is between 12:30 and 13:00.\n\nNext, Tuesday. Joshua has some meetings: 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, and 14:30 to 15:00. Joyce is completely booked all day on Tuesday, so there's no slot available.\n\nNow, Wednesday. Joshua doesn't have any meetings listed for Wednesday. Joyce is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 16:30. That leaves some potential times in the late morning and early afternoon. Specifically, between 11:00 and 12:30, but considering Joyce's preferences, she prefers not to meet on Wednesday before 12:00. So, the earliest available slot on Wednesday would be after 12:00, but Joyce is busy from 12:30 onwards. Therefore, Wednesday doesn't seem feasible.\n\nGiven that Tuesday is fully booked for Joyce and Wednesday has conflicts, the best option is Monday. The only overlapping free time is from 12:30 to 13:00. This slot works for both Joshua and Joyce and meets all the constraints.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:30:13:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
