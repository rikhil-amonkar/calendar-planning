            "raw_model_response": "Alright, I need to schedule a meeting for Jose, Keith, Logan, Megan, Gary, and Bobby on Monday. The meeting should be half an hour long between 9:00 and 17:00. Each person has their own schedule, so I need to find a time that works for everyone.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's availability:\n\n- **Jose**: Busy during 11:00-11:30 and 12:30-13:00. He doesn't want to meet after 15:30.\n- **Keith**: Busy during 14:00-14:30 and 15:00-15:30.\n- **Logan**: Busy during 9:00-10:00, 12:00-12:30, and 15:00-15:30.\n- **Megan**: Blocked during 9:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-13:30, and 14:30-16:30.\n- **Gary**: Blocked during 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, and 14:30-16:30.\n- **Bobby**: Busy during 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, and 13:00-16:00.\n\nNow, I'll look for overlapping free times that fit a 30-minute meeting.\n\n- **9:00-10:00**: Megan, Gary, and Logan are busy. Not possible.\n- **10:30-11:00**: Jose is free, Keith is free, Logan is free, Megan is busy until 10:30, Gary is busy until 10:30, Bobby is free. But Megan and Gary are busy until 10:30, so 10:30-11:00 might work, but let me check others.\n- **11:30-12:00**: Jose is busy, so no.\n- **12:30-13:00**: Jose is busy, Logan is busy, so no.\n- **13:30-14:00**: Gary is busy, so no.\n- **14:30-15:00**: Keith is busy, Megan is busy, Gary is busy, Bobby is busy. Not possible.\n- **15:30-16:00**: Keith is busy, Logan is busy. Jose doesn't want to meet after 15:30, so this is out.\n- **16:30-17:00**: Most are free, but Jose doesn't want to meet after 15:30, so this is also out.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Between 10:00 and 10:30, Megan and Gary are busy. At 10:30, Megan and Gary are free, but Jose is busy until 11:00. So 10:30-11:00 seems possible except for Jose. Hmm.\n\nLooking back, maybe there's a slot I missed. What about 16:00-16:30? Keith is free, Logan is busy until 15:30, so after 15:30, Logan is free. But Jose doesn't want to meet after 15:30, so that's out.\n\nWait, maybe 14:00-14:30? Keith is busy, so no. 15:00-15:30? Keith is busy, Logan is busy, so no.\n\nI think the only possible time is 10:30-11:00, but Jose is busy until 11:00. So maybe 11:00-11:30? But Jose is busy then. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. At 10:30-11:00, Jose is free, Keith is free, Logan is free, Megan is free after 10:30, Gary is free after 10:30, and Bobby is free. So 10:30-11:00 works for everyone except Jose, who is free at 10:30 but busy at 11:00. Wait, no, Jose is busy during 11:00-11:30, so 10:30-11:00 is free for him.\n\nWait, no, Jose's busy times are 11:00-11:30 and 12:30-13:00. So 10:30-11:00 is free for Jose. So yes, 10:30-11:00 works for everyone.\n\nSo the proposed time is 10:30 to 11:00.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
