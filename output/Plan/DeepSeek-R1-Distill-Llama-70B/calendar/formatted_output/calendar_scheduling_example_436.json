            "raw_model_response": "Alright, so I've got this task where I need to schedule a 30-minute meeting for seven people: Patrick, Shirley, Jeffrey, Gloria, Nathan, Angela, and David. The meeting has to be on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Each of them has their own busy times, and I need to find a slot where none of them are busy. \n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times to see where the overlaps are. Let's go one by one.\n\nPatrick is busy from 13:30 to 14:00 and 14:30 to 15:00. So, he's free before 13:30, between 14:00 and 14:30, and after 15:00.\n\nShirley has meetings at 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 14:30-15:00, and 16:00-17:00. So her free slots are between 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-14:30, and 15:00-16:00.\n\nJeffrey is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, and 16:00-17:00. His free times are 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-16:00.\n\nGloria is busy from 11:30-12:00 and 15:00-15:30. So she's free otherwise.\n\nNathan is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, and 14:00-17:00. So he's free between 9:30-10:30, 12:00-14:00.\n\nAngela has meetings from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 12:30-15:00, and 15:30-16:30. Her free slots are 9:30-10:00, 11:00-12:30, 15:00-15:30, and after 16:30.\n\nDavid is busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-14:00, and 14:30-16:30. So he's free between 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 14:00-14:30, and after 16:30.\n\nNow, I need to find a 30-minute slot where all seven are free. Let's look for overlapping free times.\n\nStarting from 9:00 onwards:\n\n- 9:00-9:30: Patrick, Shirley, Jeffrey, Nathan, Angela, David are busy. Only Gloria is free. Not possible.\n\n- 9:30-10:00: Patrick is free, Shirley is free until 11:00, Jeffrey is free until 10:30, Gloria is free, Nathan is free until 10:30, Angela is free until 10:00, David is free until 10:00. So from 9:30-10:00, everyone except maybe some? Wait, let me check:\n\nAt 9:30-10:00:\n- Patrick: Free\n- Shirley: Free\n- Jeffrey: Free\n- Gloria: Free\n- Nathan: Free\n- Angela: Free until 10:00\n- David: Free until 10:00\n\nSo all seven are free from 9:30-10:00. That's a 30-minute window. Wait, but the earliest possible time is preferred, so this might be the slot.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes the end times might overlap. For example, if someone's busy starts at 10:00, then 9:30-10:00 is okay.\n\nYes, so 9:30-10:00 seems to work for everyone. Let me confirm each person:\n\n- Patrick: Free\n- Shirley: Free\n- Jeffrey: Free\n- Gloria: Free\n- Nathan: Free\n- Angela: Free until 10:00\n- David: Free until 10:00\n\nSo yes, 9:30-10:00 on Monday works for all.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:30:10:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
