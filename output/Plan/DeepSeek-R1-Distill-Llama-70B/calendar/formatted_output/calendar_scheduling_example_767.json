Both have some blocked times, so I need to find a time that works for both.\n\nFirst, let me look at Martha's schedule:\n\n- **Monday:** Blocked from 16:00 to 17:00.\n- **Tuesday:** Blocked from 15:00 to 15:30.\n- **Wednesday:** Blocked from 10:00 to 11:00 and from 14:00 to 14:30.\n\nNow, Beverly's schedule:\n\n- **Monday:** Blocked from 9:00 to 13:30 and from 14:00 to 17:00.\n- **Tuesday:** Blocked the entire day from 9:00 to 17:00.\n- **Wednesday:** Blocked from 9:30 to 15:30 and from 16:30 to 17:00.\n\nOkay, so I need to find a one-hour slot where neither Martha nor Beverly is blocked. Let's go day by day.\n\n**Monday:**\n- Martha is free except from 16:00 to 17:00.\n- Beverly is blocked until 13:30 and then again from 14:00 onwards.\n- So, the only possible time on Monday is between 13:30 and 14:00. But that's only 30 minutes, and we need an hour. So, Monday doesn't work.\n\n**Tuesday:**\n- Martha is blocked from 15:00 to 15:30.\n- Beverly is blocked the entire day.\n- So, no time on Tuesday works.\n\n**Wednesday:**\n- Martha is blocked from 10:00 to 11:00 and from 14:00 to 14:30.\n- Beverly is blocked from 9:30 to 15:30 and from 16:30 to 17:00.\n- So, let's see:\n  - From 9:00 to 9:30: Martha is free, but Beverly is blocked starting at 9:30, so that's only 30 minutes.\n  - From 11:00 to 14:00: Martha is free, and Beverly is blocked until 15:30, so the overlap here is from 11:00 to 14:00, but Beverly is blocked until 15:30. Wait, no, Beverly is blocked from 9:30 to 15:30, so from 11:00 to 14:00 is still blocked for Beverly.\n  - From 15:30 to 16:30: Martha is free, and Beverly is free from 15:30 to 16:30 (since Beverly is blocked until 15:30 and then free until 16:30).\n  - So, the available slot is from 15:30 to 16:30.\n\nThat seems to be the only time that works for both Martha and Beverly on Wednesday.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{15:30:16:30}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}",
