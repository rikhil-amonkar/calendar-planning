They can meet any day from Monday to Thursday, and the meeting has to be between 9:00 and 17:00. The goal is to find the earliest possible time that works for both of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each day one by one and see where their schedules overlap. Starting with Monday.\n\nMary's schedule on Monday isn't provided, so I'll assume she's free all day unless stated otherwise. Alexis, on the other hand, has some busy times on Monday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-16:30. So, the free slots for Alexis on Monday would be 8:00-9:00 (but work hours start at 9:00), then 12:00-12:30, and 16:30-17:00. Since Mary is free all day, the possible meeting times on Monday could be 12:00-12:30 or 16:30-17:00.\n\nBut wait, the group wants the earliest availability, so 12:00-12:30 on Monday seems like a possible time. However, I should check other days to see if there's an earlier time elsewhere.\n\nMoving on to Tuesday. Mary has meetings from 10:00-10:30, 15:30-16:00. Alexis is busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-15:30, and 16:00-17:00. So, the free slots for Alexis on Tuesday are 11:30-12:00, 15:30-16:00. Mary is free from 9:00-10:00 (but Alexis is busy then), 10:30-10:30 (no time), 11:30-12:00 (possible), 12:00-15:30 (Alexis is busy), 16:00-17:00 (Alexis is busy). So, the only overlap on Tuesday is 11:30-12:00.\n\nComparing this to Monday's 12:00-12:30, Tuesday's 11:30-12:00 is earlier. So, Tuesday seems better.\n\nNow, checking Wednesday. Mary has meetings from 9:30-10:00 and 15:00-15:30. Alexis is busy from 9:00-11:00, 11:30-17:00. So, the free slots for Alexis are 11:00-11:30. Mary is free from 10:00-9:30 (wait, that doesn't make sense, maybe 10:00-15:00 except her meetings). So, the overlap on Wednesday would be 11:00-11:30.\n\nThat's earlier than Tuesday's 11:30-12:00. So, Wednesday might be the earliest.\n\nFinally, Thursday. Mary is busy from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30. Alexis is busy from 10:00-12:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So, the free slots for Alexis are 9:00-10:00 (but Mary is busy then), 12:00-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-16:30. Mary is free from 11:30-10:30 (again, doesn't make sense), so likely 11:30-15:00 except her meetings. The overlap would be 12:00-14:00, but the earliest time here is 12:00, which is later than Wednesday's 11:00.\n\nSo, comparing all days, Wednesday at 11:00-11:30 seems to be the earliest possible time that works for both Mary and Alexis.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:00:11:30}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}",
