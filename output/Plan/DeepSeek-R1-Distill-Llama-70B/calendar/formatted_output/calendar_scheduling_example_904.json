However, Daniel is free from 14:00 to 15:30, but Bradley is busy until 14:00 and then again from 15:30 to 16:30. So, 14:00 to 14:30 seems possible, but I need to double-check.\n\n3. **Wednesday:**\n   - Daniel prefers not to meet on Wednesday, so we skip this day.\n\n4. **Thursday:**\n   - Daniel prefers not to meet on Thursday, so we skip this day.\n\n5. **Friday:**\n   - Bradley does not want to meet on Friday, so we skip this day.\n\nLooking back at Tuesday, let's verify the 14:00 to 14:30 slot:\n- Daniel is free from 14:00 to 15:30.\n- Bradley is busy from 13:30 to 14:00, so he becomes free at 14:00. Therefore, 14:00 to 14:30 works for both.\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Tuesday from 14:00 to 14:30.\n</think>\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:00:14:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}",
