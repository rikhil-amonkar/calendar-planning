The goal is to find a 30-minute time slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 that works for all six participants: Doris, Theresa, Christian, Terry, Carolyn, and Kyle. Each of them has specific blocks of time when they're unavailable, so I need to carefully analyze their schedules to find a common free slot.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's unavailable time slots:\n\n1. **Doris**:\n   - 9:00 to 11:00\n   - 13:30 to 14:00\n   - 16:00 to 16:30\n\n2. **Theresa**:\n   - 10:00 to 12:00\n\n3. **Christian**:\n   - No meetings all day (available the entire time).\n\n4. **Terry**:\n   - 9:30 to 10:00\n   - 11:30 to 12:00\n   - 12:30 to 13:00\n   - 13:30 to 14:00\n   - 14:30 to 15:00\n   - 15:30 to 17:00\n\n5. **Carolyn**:\n   - 9:00 to 10:30\n   - 11:00 to 11:30\n   - 12:00 to 13:00\n   - 13:30 to 14:30\n   - 15:00 to 17:00\n\n6. **Kyle**:\n   - 9:00 to 9:30\n   - 11:30 to 12:00\n   - 12:30 to 13:00\n   - 14:30 to 17:00\n\nNow, I'll map out the entire day from 9:00 to 17:00 and mark the unavailable times for each participant. Then, I'll look for a 30-minute window where none of them have any conflicts.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n\n- **9:00 to 9:30**:\n  - Doris: Busy (9:00-11:00)\n  - Theresa: Busy (10:00-12:00)\n  - Terry: Busy (9:30-10:00)\n  - Carolyn: Busy (9:00-10:30)\n  - Kyle: Busy (9:00-9:30)\n  - Christian: Free\n  - **Conclusion**: Not a valid slot as most are busy.\n\n- **9:30 to 10:00**:\n  - Doris: Busy\n  - Theresa: Busy\n  - Terry: Busy\n  - Carolyn: Busy\n  - Kyle: Free after 9:30\n  - Christian: Free\n  - **Conclusion**: Still, most are busy.\n\n- **10:00 to 10:30**:\n  - Doris: Busy\n  - Theresa: Busy\n  - Terry: Free until 11:30\n  - Carolyn: Busy\n  - Kyle: Free\n  - Christian: Free\n  - **Conclusion**: Doris, Theresa, and Carolyn are busy.\n\n- **10:30 to 11:00**:\n  - Doris: Busy until 11:00\n  - Theresa: Busy until 12:00\n  - Terry: Free\n  - Carolyn: Busy until 10:30\n  - Kyle: Free\n  - Christian: Free\n  - **Conclusion**: Doris and Theresa are busy.\n\n- **11:00 to 11:30**:\n  - Doris: Busy until 11:00, so free from 11:00\n  - Theresa: Busy until 12:00\n  - Terry: Free\n  - Carolyn: Busy (11:00-11:30)\n  - Kyle: Free\n  - Christian: Free\n  - **Conclusion**: Theresa and Carolyn are busy.\n\n- **11:30 to 12:00**:\n  - Doris: Free\n  - Theresa: Busy\n  - Terry: Busy (11:30-12:00)\n  - Carolyn: Busy (11:00-11:30) and then free?
