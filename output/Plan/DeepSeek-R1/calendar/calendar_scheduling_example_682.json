            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. The goal is to find a 30-minute meeting slot between Amanda and Nathan on either Monday or Tuesday, within 9:00 to 17:00 work hours. But there are several constraints to consider.\n\nFirst, let's note the constraints from the problem:\n\n1. Amanda doesn't want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00. So any Tuesday slot must be before 11:00.\n2. Nathan cannot meet on Monday at all. So Monday is out for Nathan, which means the meeting has to be on Tuesday.\n3. Therefore, the possible day is Tuesday, and the time must be between 9:00 and 11:00 on Tuesday.\n\nWait, but the problem says the meeting can be scheduled on either Monday or Tuesday. But Nathan can't meet on Monday, so the only possible day is Tuesday. So we need to look at Tuesday's availability for both Amanda and Nathan, but with Amanda's restriction that she doesn't want to meet after 11:00 on Tuesday. So the available time on Tuesday is from 9:00 to 11:00 for Amanda, considering her other busy times.\n\nLet's list out Amanda's schedule on Tuesday:\n- 9:00 to 9:30 busy\n- 10:00 to 10:30 busy\n- 11:30 to 12:00 busy (but after 11:00, so irrelevant)\n- 13:30 to 14:30, etc., which are all after 11:00.\n\nSo Amanda's available slots on Tuesday before 11:00 are:\n- 9:30 to 10:00\n- 10:30 to 11:00\n\nNow check Nathan's schedule on Tuesday:\n- 9:00 to 10:30 busy\n- 11:00 to 13:00 busy\n- Then other times after that, but since we're limited to before 11:00, let's see.\n\nNathan is busy from 9:00 to 10:30 on Tuesday. Then from 11:00 to 13:00. So between 10:30 to 11:00, Nathan is free? Let me check again.\n\nYes. Nathan's Tuesday schedule:\n- 9:00 to 10:30\n- 11:00 to 13:00\nSo between 10:30 and 11:00, he's free.\n\nSo Amanda's available slots on Tuesday before 11:00 are 9:30-10:00 and 10:30-11:00. Nathan's available during 10:30-11:00. So the overlapping time is 10:30 to 11:00. But Amanda's busy from 10:00 to 10:30, so after that, from 10:30 to 11:00, she's free. And Nathan is free from 10:30 to 11:00. So a 30-minute meeting here would work: 10:30-11:00 on Tuesday.\n\nWait, but let's confirm. Amanda's Tuesday schedule includes being busy from 10:00 to 10:30, then next busy at 11:30. So from 10:30 to 11:00, she's free. Nathan is busy until 10:30, then free until 11:00. So 10:30-11:00 is the only possible slot that fits both, and it's 30 minutes. That should work.",
