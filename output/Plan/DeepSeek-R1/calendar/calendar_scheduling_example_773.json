            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for Patrick and Roy. The meeting should be one hour long between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. They want the earliest possible time.\n\nFirst, Patrick's calendar is completely open, so his availability isn't an issue. The main focus is on Roy's busy times. Let me go through each day.\n\nStarting with Monday. Roy is busy from 10:00-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-17:00. The available slots on Monday would be from 9:00 to 10:00 (but 9:00 is the start time, so 9:00-10:00 is an hour). Then between 11:30 to 12:00 (only 30 minutes, not enough). After 13:00 to 14:00 (another hour). Then 14:30 to 15:00 (30 minutes again). So possible slots on Monday: 9:00-10:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00 (but the last one is only 30 minutes). Wait, 13:00 to 14:00 is available. So that's a one-hour slot. But wait, Roy's busy from 12:00-13:00, so after that, from 13:00 onwards he's free until 14:00. Then busy again at 14:00. So 13:00-14:00 is available. So on Monday, possible times are 9:00-10:00 and 13:00-14:00.\n\nNext, Tuesday. Roy is busy 10:30-11:30, 12:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00. So available on Tuesday: from 9:00 to 10:30. That's 1.5 hours. So 9:00-10:00 would work. Then between 11:30-12:00 (30 mins), 14:30-15:00 (30 mins), 15:30-16:00 (30 mins). So the earliest on Tuesday would be 9:00-10:00.\n\nWednesday: Roy's busy at 9:30-11:30, 12:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:30-17:00. Available slots on Wednesday: 9:00-9:30 (30 mins), 11:30-12:30 (1 hour), 14:00-14:30 (30 mins), 15:30-16:30 (1 hour). So possible slots are 11:30-12:30 and 15:30-16:30.\n\nNow, the earliest possible time. Let's check the earliest day first: Monday. The earliest slot on Monday is 9:00-10:00. That's available for both. Then Tuesday's 9:00-10:00. But between Monday and Tuesday, Monday comes first. So the earliest possible is Monday 9:00-10:00. Wait, but let me double-check Roy's Monday schedule. Roy is busy from 10:00-11:30. So before 10:00, from 9:00-10:00, that's free. So that's a valid one-hour slot. Since Patrick is free all the time, this should work. So the earliest possible is Monday 9:00-10:00. But wait, let me check again. The work hours start at 9:00, so the meeting can start at 9:00. So that's the earliest possible. The answer should be Monday at 9:00-10:00.",
