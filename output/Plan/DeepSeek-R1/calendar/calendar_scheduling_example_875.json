            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for Natalie and William that's one hour long between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. First, I should go through each day and check their availability.\n\nStarting with Monday. Natalie has busy times: 9:00-9:30, 10-12, 12:30-13, 14-14:30, 15-16:30. William is busy 9:30-11 and 11:30-17. So on Monday, Natalie's available slots might be 9:30-10 (but William is busy then), 12-12:30 (but William is busy after 11:30 until 17, so that's no good. So Monday seems impossible.\n\nNext, Tuesday. Natalie's busy times: 9-9:30, 10-10:30, 12:30-14, 16-17. William is busy 9-13 and 13:30-16. So Natalie's available on Tuesday after 14:00 until 16:00, but William is available from 16:00 onwards. Wait, William's busy until 16:00, but Natalie is free from 14-16 except 16-17. Wait, Natalie is free from 9:30-10 (but William's busy), then 10:30-12:30 (William is busy until 13). Then Natalie is free 14-16 (since her next busy is 12:30-14, so after 14 she's free until 16). William on Tuesday is free from 13-13:30 (half hour) and then 16-17. So Natalie is free 14-16, but William is busy until 16. So possible time might be 16:00-17:00, but Natalie is busy from 16-17. So no overlap here. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, Natalie's Tuesday schedule: busy until 14:00, then from 14:00 to 16:00 she's free? Wait her schedule says Natalie is busy on Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00. So after 14:00, she's free until 16:00. William on Tuesday is busy until 13:00, then free 13-13:30, then busy again until 16:00. So William is free 13-13:30 and 16-17. Natalie is free 14-16. So their overlapping free time would be... maybe at 16:00? But Natalie is busy from 16:00, so no. So Tuesday doesn't work.\n\nWednesday. Natalie's busy: 11-11:30, 16-16:30. So her available times are 9-11, 11:30-16, 16:30-17. William's Wednesday schedule: busy 9-12:30, 13-14:30, 15:30-16, 16:30-17. So William is free from 12:30-13, 14:30-15:30, 16-16:30. Let's check overlaps. Natalie is free from 11:30-16 (except 16-16:30). So Natalie's available 11:30-16 (but 16-16:30 she's busy). William's free times: 12:30-13 (Natalie is free), 14:30-15:30 (Natalie is free), 16-16:30 (Natalie is busy). So possible slots: 12:30-13:00 (30 minutes, not enough), 14:30-15:30 (1 hour). So 14:30 to 15:30 on Wednesday. Let me check: Natalie is free from 11:30 to 16, so 14:30-15:30 is available. William is free 14:30-15:30. So this works.\n\nWait, let me confirm. William's Wednesday busy times: 9-12:30, 13-14:30, 15:30-16, etc. So after 14:30, he's free until 15:30. So 14:30-15:30 is free. Natalie is free during that time. So that's a valid slot. So the meeting can be on Wednesday from 14:30 to 15:30. \n\nChecking Thursday. Natalie's schedule: busy 10-11, 11:30-15, 15:30-16, 16:30-17. So she's free 9-10, 11-11:30, 15-15:30, 16-16:30. William's Thursday: busy 9-10:30, 11-11:30, 12-12:30, 13-14, 15-17. His free times would be 10:30-11, 11:30-12, 12:30-13, 14-15. Natalie's free times: 9-10 (but William is busy until 10:30), 11-11:30 (William is busy 11-11:30), 15-15:30 (William is busy after 15). So overlapping possible times: 14-15? Natalie is free from 11:30-15 (but she's busy 11:30-15, except 15-15:30). Wait, Natalie's Thursday: 10-11, 11:30-15:00, then 15:30-16:00. So she's free from 9-10, 11-11:30, 15-15:30, 16-16:30. William's Thursday free times: 10:30-11 (Natalie is busy), 11:30-12 (Natalie is busy 11:30-15?), no. So Thursday doesn't have an hour slot.\n\nSo the only possible day is Wednesday from 14:30 to 15:30.",
