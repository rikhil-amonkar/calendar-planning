This slot also respects Angela's preference to avoid meetings before 15:00.\n\n- **Katherine**: Free (last busy period ends at 14:30, and no conflicts until after 17:00).\n- **Rebecca**: Free all day.\n- **Julie**: Free (last busy period ends at 15:30, and next conflict is after 17:00).\n- **Angela**: Free (busy until 15:00 and then from 16:30, so 16:00-16:30 is open).\n- **Nicholas**: Free (busy until 16:00 and then from 16:30, so 16:00-16:30 is open).\n- **Carl**: Free (busy until 16:00 and then from 16:30, so 16:00-16:30 is open).\n\nAlthough an earlier slot at 11:00-11:30 is also free for all, it is before 15:00 and conflicts with Angela's preference. Therefore, the later slot is chosen to accommodate her preference.\n\nThe proposed time is Monday, 16:00 to 16:30.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{16:00:16:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
