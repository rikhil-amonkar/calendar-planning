You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Juan, Marilyn and Ronald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJuan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nMarilyn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nRonald has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:30; \n\nJuan can not meet on Monday after 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

After analyzing the busy times:\n\n- **Juan**: Busy 9:00\u201310:30 and 15:30\u201316:00; free between 10:30\u201315:30 (last start at 15:00).\n- **Marilyn**: Busy 11:00\u201311:30 and 12:30\u201313:00; free in slots like 10:30\u201311:00, 11:30\u201312:30, and 13:00 onwards.\n- **Ronald**: Busy 9:00\u201310:30, 12:00\u201312:30, 13:00\u201313:30, and 14:00\u201316:30; free between 10:30\u201312:00, 12:30\u201313:00, and 13:30\u201314:00.\n\nThe overlapping free slot for all three is **10:30\u201311:00** on Monday. This slot:\n- Fits within Juan\u2019s free time (starts right after his 10:30 availability).\n- Avoids Marilyn\u2019s 11:00\u201311:30 busy block.\n- Fits Ronald\u2019s 10:30\u201312:00 free window.\n- Ends by 16:00 as required.\n\n**Output in specified JSON format**:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
