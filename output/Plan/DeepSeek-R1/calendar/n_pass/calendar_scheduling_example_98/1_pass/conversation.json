You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Juan, Marilyn and Ronald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJuan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nMarilyn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nRonald has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:30; \n\nJuan can not meet on Monday after 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT write any code or algorithms. Simply provide the answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}\n\nFor example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"

This time slot is within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 and works for all participants:\n\n- Juan is free after 10:30 and before his next busy period at 15:30, and the meeting ends before 16:00, satisfying his constraint.\n- Marilyn is free during this time, as her first busy period starts at 11:00.\n- Ronald is free after 10:30 and before his next busy period at 12:00.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}"
