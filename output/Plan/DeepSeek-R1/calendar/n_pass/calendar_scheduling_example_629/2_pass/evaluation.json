However, Margaret explicitly does not want to meet on Monday at all, and Tuesday before 14:30 is also prohibited. Alexis's Tuesday schedule shows availability between 16:30-17:00, but this conflicts with Margaret's preference against Tuesday meetings before 14:30\u2014which was respected\u2014but Monday remains unavailable. \n\nThe only feasible solution is **Tuesday from 16:30 to 17:00**, as it:\n- Avoids Monday entirely (per Margaret's constraint)\n- Starts after 14:30 on Tuesday (respecting Margaret's time preference)\n- Fits within 30 minutes\n- Aligns with both schedules:\n  - Margaret is free after 12:30 on Tuesday (no blocks after 14:30)\n  - Alexis is free after 16:30 (meeting ends at 16:30)\n\n**Revised Solution:**  \n{\"time_range\": \"{16:30:17:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}",
