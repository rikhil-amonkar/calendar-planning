    "execution_output": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the meeting must be scheduled for 30 minutes between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Susan prefers not to meet on Tuesday, and Sandra cannot meet on Monday after 16:00. After analyzing the free times for both participants, the available slots that satisfy all constraints are:\n\n- **Monday**: 13:00-13:30 or 15:00-15:30 or 15:30-16:00\n- **Wednesday**: 11:30-12:00 or 12:30-13:00\n\nTo respect Susan's preference against Tuesday, Tuesday is avoided. Among the available options, Wednesday at 12:30-13:00 is selected as a suitable time, as it avoids any potential lunch-hour conflicts and fits neatly within both participants' schedules.\n\n- Susan is free on Wednesday from 10:30 to 14:00, so 12:30-13:00 is within this window.\n- Sandra is free on Wednesday from 12:30 to 13:00.\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Wednesday from 12:30 to 13:00.\n\n**Output in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:30:13:00}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```",
