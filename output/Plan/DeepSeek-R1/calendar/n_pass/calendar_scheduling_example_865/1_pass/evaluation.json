The overlapping free period from 9:00 to 10:00 provides a one-hour slot that satisfies the meeting duration and is the earliest possible across all days.\n\nNo other day offers an earlier or suitable one-hour slot:\n- Tuesday has no one-hour overlap (Daniel is only free for 30 minutes at 10:00-10:30).\n- Wednesday has no one-hour overlap (all overlapping free periods are 30 minutes or less).\n- Thursday has no one-hour overlap (all overlapping free periods are 30 minutes).\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\"time_range\": \"9:00:10:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
