After analyzing the existing schedules:\n\n- **Monday**: Judith prefers to avoid more meetings. Available slots exist (e.g., 14:00\u201315:00 or 14:30\u201315:30), but Judith's preference rules this day out unless unavoidable.\n- **Tuesday**: Timothy has no available 1-hour slot (only 30-minute gaps exist), making scheduling impossible.\n- **Wednesday**: \n  - Judith is free after 12:00 (avoids her preference for pre-12:00 meetings).\n  - Timothy has free slots at 12:00\u201313:00 and 12:30\u201313:30.\n  - The earliest available 1-hour slot starting at or after 12:00 is **12:00\u201313:00**.\n\n**Validation**:\n- Judith: Free on Wednesday from 12:00\u201317:00 (blocked only until 12:00).\n- Timothy: Free on Wednesday from 11:00\u201313:30, so 12:00\u201313:00 is fully available.\n\nThis slot honors Judith\u2019s preferences (avoids Monday and Wednesday before 12:00) and fits both schedules.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:00:13:00}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```",
