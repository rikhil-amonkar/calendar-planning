Therefore, Martha is free from 9:00-10:00, 11:00-14:00, and 14:30-17:00.\n- **Beverly's Wednesday availability**: Free except for 9:30-15:30 and 16:30-17:00. Therefore, Beverly is free from 9:00-9:30 and 15:30-16:30.\n- **Common availability**: The only overlapping one-hour slot is 15:30-16:30 on Wednesday.\n\nThis slot satisfies all constraints:\n- It is a one-hour meeting.\n- It occurs between 9:00 and 17:00.\n- Both participants are free during this time.\n\nNo other day (Monday or Tuesday) has a suitable one-hour slot due to conflicts:\n- **Monday**: Beverly is only free from 13:30-14:00 (30 minutes), which is insufficient for a one-hour meeting. Martha is free except at 16:00-17:00, but no overlap exists.\n- **Tuesday**: Beverly is blocked all day (9:00-17:00), so no meeting is possible.\n\nProposed time in the required JSON format:\n\n{\"time_range\": \"15:30:16:30\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}",
