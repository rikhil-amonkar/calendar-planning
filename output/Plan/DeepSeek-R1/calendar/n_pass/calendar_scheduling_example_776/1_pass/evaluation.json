John has no existing meetings, but prefers to avoid meetings on Monday after 14:30. Jennifer's schedule has specific busy times, leaving several 30-minute gaps.\n\nJennifer's available gaps are:\n- Monday: 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, and 14:30-15:00 (but 14:30-15:00 should be avoided due to John's preference).\n- Tuesday: 11:30-12:00.\n- Wednesday: 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nTo respect John's preference to avoid Monday after 14:30, the slot at 14:30-15:00 on Monday is excluded from consideration. All other gaps are valid and work for both participants.\n\nThe chosen meeting time is Wednesday from 12:30 to 13:00. This fits within the work hours, avoids John's preference conflict, and aligns with Jennifer's free time.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"12:30:13:00\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```",
