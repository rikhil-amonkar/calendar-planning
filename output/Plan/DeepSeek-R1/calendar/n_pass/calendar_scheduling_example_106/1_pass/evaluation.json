Here's the validation:\n\n- **Olivia**: Free from 9:00\u201312:30 (10:00\u201311:00 is within this interval).\n- **Anna**: Free all day.\n- **Virginia**: Free from 10:00\u201311:30 (10:00\u201311:00 is within this interval).\n- **Paul**: Free from 9:30\u201311:00 (10:00\u201311:00 is within this interval).\n\nNo other slot works:\n- **Morning (9:00\u201311:30)**: \n  - 9:00\u201310:00: Virginia is busy (blocked 9:00\u201310:00).\n  - 9:30\u201310:30: Virginia is free starting at 10:00, so 9:30\u201310:30 overlaps with her busy period until 10:00.\n  - 10:30\u201311:30: Paul is busy starting at 11:00 (meeting 11:00\u201311:30), so this overlaps.\n- **Afternoon (11:30\u201317:00)**: \n  - Virginia is blocked from 11:30\u201316:00, leaving no one-hour window for her until after 16:00, but Paul and Olivia have conflicts after 16:00 (e.g., Paul\u2019s 16:30 meeting; Olivia\u2019s 16:30 meeting).\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:00:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
