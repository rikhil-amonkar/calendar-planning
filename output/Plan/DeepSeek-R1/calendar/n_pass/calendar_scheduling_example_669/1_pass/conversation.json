You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jean and Doris for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJean is busy on Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDoris has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00; \n\nDoris would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the constraints and preferences provided, the meeting must be scheduled on Monday, as Doris is fully occupied on Tuesday from 9:00 to 17:00, leaving no available time on that day. On Monday, both Jean and Doris have free periods that can accommodate a 30-minute meeting between 9:00 and 17:00.\n\nDoris's busy times on Monday are:\n- 9:00 to 11:30\n- 12:00 to 12:30\n- 13:30 to 16:00\n- 16:30 to 17:00\n\nThis results in the following free periods for Doris on Monday:\n- 11:30 to 12:00 (30 minutes)\n- 12:30 to 13:30 (60 minutes)\n- 16:00 to 16:30 (30 minutes)\n\nJean has no scheduled busy times on Monday, so she is available throughout the work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n\nDoris prefers not to meet on Monday after 14:00, so the slot from 16:00 to 16:30 should be avoided if possible. The available slots before 14:00 are:\n- 11:30 to 12:00\n- 12:30 to 13:30 (within which any 30-minute segment can be chosen, such as 12:30 to 13:00 or 13:00 to 13:30)\n\nThe earliest feasible slot that respects Doris's preference is 11:30 to 12:00 on Monday. This slot is exactly 30 minutes, falls before 14:00, and works for both participants.\n\nTherefore, the proposed meeting time is Monday from 11:30 to 12:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:30:12:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
