You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Eric and Henry for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nEric has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00; \nHenry has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nHenry would rather not meet on Monday after 10:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

Eric has no conflicts, and Henry is free until his 9:30 meeting. This slot is before 10:00, respecting Henry's preference.\n- Other slots like 10:00 to 10:30 or 11:00 to 11:30 are available but after 10:00, which Henry would rather avoid.\n\nThe slot from 9:00 to 9:30 works for both schedules and aligns with Henry's preference. Therefore, it is the optimal choice.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:00:09:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
