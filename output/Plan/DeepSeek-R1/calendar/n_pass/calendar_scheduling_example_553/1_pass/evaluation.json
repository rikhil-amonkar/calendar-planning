Eric has no conflicts, and Henry is free until his 9:30 meeting. This slot is before 10:00, respecting Henry's preference.\n- Other slots like 10:00 to 10:30 or 11:00 to 11:30 are available but after 10:00, which Henry would rather avoid.\n\nThe slot from 9:00 to 9:30 works for both schedules and aligns with Henry's preference. Therefore, it is the optimal choice.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:00:09:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
