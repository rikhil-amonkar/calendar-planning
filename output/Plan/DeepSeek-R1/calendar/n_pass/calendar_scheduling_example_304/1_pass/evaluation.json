Preference for before 13:00 is satisfied.\n- **Bobby**: Free from 9:00 to 12:00 (busy at 12:00-12:30, 14:30-15:00). 11:00-11:30 is within this free period.\n- **Elizabeth**: Free from 9:30 to 11:30 (busy at 9:00-9:30, 11:30-13:00, etc.). 11:00-11:30 ends exactly at 11:30, when her next busy period starts, so she is free for the full meeting.\n- **Tyler**: Free from 11:00 to 12:00 (busy at 9:00-11:00, 12:00-12:30, etc.). 11:00-11:30 starts when he becomes free and is within this period.\n- **Edward**: Free from 11:00 to 11:30 (busy at 10:00-11:00, 11:30-14:00, etc.). 11:00-11:30 is exactly his free slot.\n\nNo other 30-minute slot before 13:00 works due to conflicts (e.g., 10:30-11:00 has conflicts with Tyler and Edward; 12:30-13:00 has conflicts with Elizabeth and Edward). After 13:00, there are possible slots, but they are avoided to respect Janice's preference.\n\n### Output in JSON Format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:00:11:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
