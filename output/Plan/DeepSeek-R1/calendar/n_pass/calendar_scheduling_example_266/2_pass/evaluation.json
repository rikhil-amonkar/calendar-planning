In standard scheduling systems, back-to-back meetings (e.g., ending at 11:00 and starting at 11:00) are acceptable unless explicitly forbidden. Since the problem states a solution exists and no buffer requirement is specified, this slot is valid.\n\n### JSON Output:\n{\"time_range\": \"11:00:11:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
