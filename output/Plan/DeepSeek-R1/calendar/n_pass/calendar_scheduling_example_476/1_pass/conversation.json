You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Daniel, Kathleen, Carolyn, Roger, Cheryl, Virginia and Angela for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDanielhas no meetings the whole day.\nKathleen is busy on Monday during 14:30 to 15:30; \nCarolyn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30; \nRoger is free the entire day.\nCheryl is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 17:00; \nVirginia is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nAngela has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:30; \n\nRoger would rather not meet on Monday before 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

To respect this preference, the slot at 13:30 to 14:00 is chosen, as it is after 12:30 and satisfies all schedule constraints.\n\n- Daniel is free all day.\n- Kathleen is free (busy only from 14:30 to 15:30).\n- Carolyn is free (last busy period ends at 13:30).\n- Roger is free and the time is after 12:30.\n- Cheryl is free from 13:30 to 14:00 (next busy period starts at 14:00).\n- Virginia is free from 13:30 to 14:30 (busy until 13:30 and next busy at 14:30).\n- Angela is free from 13:30 to 14:00 (next busy period starts at 14:00).\n\nThus, the meeting is scheduled for Monday from 13:30 to 14:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{13:30:14:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
