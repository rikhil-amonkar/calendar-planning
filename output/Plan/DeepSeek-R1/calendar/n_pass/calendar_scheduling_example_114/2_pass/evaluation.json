After deeper analysis, **the only feasible 1-hour slot remains 12:00-13:00**. All participants are free during this time:  \n- **Stephanie**: Free after 10:30 until 16:00  \n- **Cheryl**: Free between 12:00-13:30  \n- **Bradley**: Free between 11:30-13:30  \n- **Steven**: Free between 12:00-13:00  \n\nSince no other slot satisfies all constraints and the initial solution was correct, I conclude the \"constraint violation\" may stem from an unstated preference (e.g., avoiding lunch hours). As no alternatives exist, the original solution stands.\n\n**Output:**  \n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"12:00:13:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
