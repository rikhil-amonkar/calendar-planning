Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n- **Diane** is available after 15:00 (free from 15:00 to 17:00, with no blocks in this period).\n- **Jack** is available after 15:00 (free from 15:00 to 17:00, with no blocks in this period).\n- **Eugene** is available from 16:30 to 17:00 (blocked until 16:30 by the 15:00 to 16:30 event).\n- **Patricia** is available from 16:30 to 17:00 (blocked until 16:30 by the 15:00 to 16:30 event).\n\nThus, the slot from 16:30 to 17:00 works for everyone.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{16:30:17:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
