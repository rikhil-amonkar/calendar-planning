    "execution_output": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the meeting must be scheduled for 30 minutes between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Joshua and Joyce both have busy times, and Joyce prefers not to meet on Monday before 12:00. Tuesday is not feasible because Joyce is busy all day from 9:00 to 17:00. \n\n- On Monday, possible slots exist at 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, and 12:30-13:00. However, 9:30-10:00 and 11:00-11:30 are before 12:00, which Joyce prefers to avoid. The 12:30-13:00 slot is after 12:00 but ends exactly when Joyce's next meeting starts at 13:00, leaving no buffer.\n- On Wednesday, multiple 30-minute slots are available within Joyce's free periods: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. Joshua is free all day Wednesday.\n\nConsidering Joyce's preference and to provide a buffer between meetings, the slot on Wednesday from 11:30 to 12:00 is ideal. It starts after Joyce's 10:00-11:00 meeting and ends before her 12:30-15:30 meeting, allowing a 30-minute buffer. This slot respects all constraints and preferences.\n\n**Proposed Time:**\n- Day: Wednesday\n- Time Range: 11:30 to 12:00\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:30:12:00}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```",
