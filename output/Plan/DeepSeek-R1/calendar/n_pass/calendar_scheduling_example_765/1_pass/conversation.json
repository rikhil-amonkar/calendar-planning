You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Joshua and Joyce for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJoshua has meetings on Monday during 15:00 to 15:30, Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nJoyce is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nJoyce would rather not meet on Monday before 12:00. Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the meeting must be scheduled for 30 minutes between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Joshua and Joyce both have busy times, and Joyce prefers not to meet on Monday before 12:00. Tuesday is not feasible because Joyce is busy all day from 9:00 to 17:00. \n\n- On Monday, possible slots exist at 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, and 12:30-13:00. However, 9:30-10:00 and 11:00-11:30 are before 12:00, which Joyce prefers to avoid. The 12:30-13:00 slot is after 12:00 but ends exactly when Joyce's next meeting starts at 13:00, leaving no buffer.\n- On Wednesday, multiple 30-minute slots are available within Joyce's free periods: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:00-12:30, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. Joshua is free all day Wednesday.\n\nConsidering Joyce's preference and to provide a buffer between meetings, the slot on Wednesday from 11:30 to 12:00 is ideal. It starts after Joyce's 10:00-11:00 meeting and ends before her 12:30-15:30 meeting, allowing a 30-minute buffer. This slot respects all constraints and preferences.\n\n**Proposed Time:**\n- Day: Wednesday\n- Time Range: 11:30 to 12:00\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:30:12:00}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```"
