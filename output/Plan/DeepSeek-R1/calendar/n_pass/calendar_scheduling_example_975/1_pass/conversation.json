You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Nicole and Daniel for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nNicole has meetings on Tuesday during 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 15:00 to 15:30, Friday during 12:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nDaniel is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Friday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the constraints and the goal of finding the earliest available one-hour meeting slot for Nicole and Daniel between 9:00 and 17:00 from Monday to Friday, the earliest feasible time is on Tuesday. \n\n- **Monday**: Nicole has no meetings, but Daniel's schedule has gaps of only 30 minutes (e.g., 12:30\u201313:00, 13:30\u201314:00, 16:30\u201317:00), which are insufficient for a 1-hour meeting.\n- **Tuesday**: \n  - Nicole is free except for 16:00\u201316:30.\n  - Daniel is busy until 10:30, then free from 10:30 to 11:30 (a 1-hour gap before his next meeting at 11:30).\n  - Both are free from **10:30 to 11:30**, which fits the meeting duration and is within work hours.\n\nNo earlier slot exists on Monday or Tuesday, and subsequent days (Wednesday\u2013Friday) would not be earlier in the week. The meeting is scheduled at the earliest possible time.\n\n**Output in JSON format**:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30:11:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```"
