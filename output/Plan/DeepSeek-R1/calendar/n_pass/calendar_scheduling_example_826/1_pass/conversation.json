        "content": "Based on the constraints and preferences, the earliest available time that works for both Cheryl and James, while respecting Cheryl's preference to avoid Wednesday and Thursday, is on Monday from 09:30 to 10:00. This 30-minute slot falls within James's free period on Monday (09:30 to 10:30) and Cheryl's open calendar. Scheduling on Monday also adheres to the preference for the earliest possible availability on an acceptable day.\n\n**Proposed time in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:30:10:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
