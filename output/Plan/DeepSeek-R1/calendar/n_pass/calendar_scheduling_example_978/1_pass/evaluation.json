Brian is free after his 9:00\u20139:30 meeting, and Julia has no conflicts until 13:00.\n- **Other Days:** No earlier non-Monday slots exist, as Tuesday is the next day with availability.\n\n**Proposed Meeting Time:**  \n- **Day:** Tuesday  \n- **Time Range:** 9:30 to 10:30  \n\nThis slot respects Brian\u2019s preference, fits within work hours (9:00\u201317:00), and is the earliest possible non-Monday availability.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{9:30:10:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```",
