The slot 9:00-9:30 on Monday is confirmed to work for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Emily**: Free during 9:00-10:00 (first meeting starts at 10:00).\n2. **Melissa**: Free during 9:00-9:30 (first meeting starts at 9:30).\n3. **Frank**: Free during 9:00-9:30 (no meetings until 10:00, and the time respects his constraint of not meeting \"after 9:30\" since the meeting *ends* at 9:30 without extending beyond it).\n4. **Duration**: Exactly 30 minutes within work hours (9:00-17:00).\n\nNo constraints are violated. The solution aligns with all provided schedules and preferences. If additional constraints were implied but not specified in the feedback, they are not reflected in the input data.\n\nFinal solution in requested JSON format:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:00:09:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
