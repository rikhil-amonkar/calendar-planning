You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Patricia and Jesse for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nPatricia has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nJesse has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given schedules and constraints, the only available one-hour slot where both Patricia and Jesse are free is on Tuesday from 09:00 to 10:00. \n\n- Patricia is free on Tuesday from 09:00 to 10:00 (before her meeting at 10:00).\n- Jesse is free on Tuesday from 09:00 to 11:00 (before his meeting at 11:00).\n\nThis slot falls within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 and satisfies the requirement for the meeting to be on either Monday or Tuesday. Note that Monday is not possible because Jesse has blocked the entire day from 9:00 to 17:00.\n\nThe output in the specified JSON format is:\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:00:10:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"
