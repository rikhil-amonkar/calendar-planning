        "content": "You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Nancy and Jose for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nNancy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 16:00; \nJose is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the constraints and the goal of scheduling the meeting at the earliest availability, the earliest available 30-minute slot that works for both Nancy and Jose is on **Wednesday from 9:30 to 10:00**. \n\n- **Wednesday analysis**:\n  - Nancy is free from **9:00\u201310:00** (except her busy period starts at 10:00).\n  - Jose is free from **9:30\u201310:00**.\n  - The overlap **9:30\u201310:00** fits the 30-minute requirement and falls within work hours (9:00\u201317:00).\n\nMonday and Tuesday are eliminated because Jose is busy all day on both days. The next available slot on Wednesday (12:30\u201313:30) is later, so 9:30\u201310:00 is the earliest.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{9:30:10:00}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```"
