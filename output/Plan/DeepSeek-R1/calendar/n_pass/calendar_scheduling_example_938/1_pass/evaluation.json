    "execution_output": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the only feasible day and time for a 30-minute meeting between Eugene and Eric, considering Eric's preference to avoid Wednesday, is on Friday from 11:00 to 11:30. Here's the reasoning:\n\n- **Monday**: Eric is busy all day (9:00 to 17:00), so no availability.\n- **Tuesday**: Eric is busy all day (9:00 to 17:00), so no availability.\n- **Wednesday**: Both have availability (e.g., 11:30-12:00 or 16:30-17:00), but Eric prefers to avoid more meetings on Wednesday, so this is not preferred if another day works.\n- **Thursday**: Eric is busy all day (9:00 to 17:00), so no availability.\n- **Friday**:\n  - Eugene is free from 11:00 to 12:00 (busy 10:30-11:00 and 12:00-12:30).\n  - Eric is free from 11:00 to 11:30 (busy 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-17:00).\n  - Overlap: Both are free from 11:00 to 11:30, which is exactly 30 minutes and within work hours (9:00-17:00).\n\nThus, the meeting can be scheduled on Friday from 11:00 to 11:30, respecting Eric's preference and all schedule constraints.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:00:11:30}\", \"day\": \"Friday\"}\n```",
