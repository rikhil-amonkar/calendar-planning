Here's the reasoning:\n\n- **Tuesday after 15:00**:  \n  - Betty is free from 15:00 to 16:30 (her constraints exclude meetings before 15:00 on Tuesday, and she has no conflicts during this slot).  \n  - Scott is free from 15:00 to 16:00 (his schedule shows no meetings between his 14:00-15:00 and 16:00-16:30 blocks).  \n  - The 30-minute slot **15:00\u201315:30** fits perfectly within both availabilities.  \n\n- **Why not other days?**  \n  - **Monday**: Betty cannot meet.  \n  - **Wednesday**: Scott prefers to avoid, and while slots exist (e.g., 9:00\u20139:30), Tuesday is prioritized.  \n  - **Thursday**: The only slot after 15:00 is 16:00\u201316:30, but Tuesday offers an earlier time.  \n\n**Proposed Time**:  \n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{15:00:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```",
