This slot accommodates everyone as follows:\n\n- **John**: Free (no meetings until 11:30).\n- **Megan**: Free (no meetings until 12:00).\n- **Brandon**: Entirely free.\n- **Kimberly**: Free after her 9:00\u20139:30 meeting until her next meeting at 10:00.\n- **Sean**: Free (no meetings until 10:00).\n- **Lori**: Free after her 9:00\u20139:30 meeting until her next meeting at 10:30.\n\nThe meeting ends at 10:00, which aligns perfectly with Kimberly's next meeting starting at 10:00 (no overlap). All other times conflict with at least one participant's schedule.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{9:30:10:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
