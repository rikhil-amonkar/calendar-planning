You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jeffrey and Harold for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJeffrey is free the entire week.\nHarold has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nHarold would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. Tuesday before 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the constraints provided:\n\n- The meeting must be 30 minutes long between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday or Tuesday.\n- Jeffrey is free the entire week, so his schedule imposes no constraints.\n- Harold has the following blocked times:\n  - Monday: 9:00 to 10:00 and 10:30 to 17:00 (so only free from 10:00 to 10:30).\n  - Tuesday: 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, and 16:00 to 17:00 (so free times are 9:30\u201310:30, 11:30\u201312:30, 13:30\u201314:30, and 15:30\u201316:00).\n- Harold prefers to avoid meetings on Monday and also prefers to avoid meetings before 14:30 on Tuesday.\n\nConsidering the schedules and preferences:\n- On Monday, the only available 30-minute slot is 10:00 to 10:30, but Harold prefers to avoid Monday, so this is less desirable.\n- On Tuesday, available 30-minute slots include:\n  - 9:30\u201310:30 (60-minute window, so 9:30\u201310:00 or 10:00\u201310:30 could work, but before 14:30 and thus should be avoided).\n  - 11:30\u201312:30 (before 14:30, avoid).\n  - 13:30\u201314:30 (before 14:30, avoid).\n  - 15:30\u201316:00 (exactly 30 minutes, after 14:30, so it respects Harold's preference).\n\nThe slot on Tuesday from 15:30 to 16:00 works for both participants:\n- It fits within the 30-minute duration.\n- It is within work hours (9:00 to 17:00).\n- It avoids Monday as preferred.\n- It occurs after 14:30 on Tuesday, respecting Harold's preference to avoid times before 14:30.\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Tuesday from 15:30 to 16:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{15:30:16:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```"
