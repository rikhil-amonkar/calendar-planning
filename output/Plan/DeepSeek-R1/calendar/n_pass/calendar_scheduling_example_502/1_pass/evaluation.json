However, the slot from 9:00 to 9:30 is chosen as it is the earliest available and avoids any potential issues with meetings ending exactly at the start of another busy period (like 12:00-12:30, which ends when Jack's next meeting starts at 12:30).\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Monday from 09:00 to 09:30.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n{\n  \"time_range\": \"09:00:09:30\",\n  \"day\": \"Monday\"\n}",
