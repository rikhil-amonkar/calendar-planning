You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jeffrey, Virginia and Melissa for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJeffrey has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00; \nVirginia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMelissa is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nMelissa would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "The meeting must be scheduled on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 for 30 minutes, considering the existing schedules and Melissa's preference to avoid meeting after 14:00 if possible.\n\nAfter analyzing the schedules:\n- Jeffrey is free from 11:00 to 17:00, except for the gaps in his schedule, but specifically, he has no conflicts after 11:00.\n- Virginia is free from 10:30 to 14:30 and 15:00 to 16:00.\n- Melissa is free from 11:30 to 12:00 and 12:30 to 13:00 (both before 14:00), and 15:00 to 16:00 (after 14:00, which is less preferred).\n\nThe overlapping free times that satisfy the 30-minute duration and respect Melissa's preference are:\n- 11:30 to 12:00: All participants are free, and it is before 14:00.\n- 12:30 to 13:00: All participants are free, and it is before 14:00.\n\nGiven Melissa's preference to avoid after 14:00, and both slots are equally viable, the earlier slot (11:30 to 12:00) is selected to best accommodate the preference.\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Monday from 11:30 to 12:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:30:12:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
