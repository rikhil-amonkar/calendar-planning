You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Lisa and Anthony for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nLisa is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 14:00 to 16:00; \nAnthony is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nYou would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

The earliest conflict-free 30-minute slot where both are fully available is:\n\n**10:00-10:30 on Monday**  \n- \u2705 Lisa is free (between her 9:30-10:30 availability)  \n- \u2705 Anthony is free (within his 9:30-11:00 availability)  \n\nThis slot satisfies all constraints:  \n- Within 9:00-17:00 work hours  \n- Avoids all busy periods for both participants  \n- Earliest possible availability after 9:30  \n\nRevised solution:  \n{\"time_range\": \"{10:00:10:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}"
