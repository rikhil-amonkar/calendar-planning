You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nRaymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nBilly has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nDonald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nBilly would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT write any code or algorithms. Simply provide the answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}\n\nFor example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"

        "content": "The possible meeting times that work for Raymond, Billy, and Donald's schedules and respect Billy's preference to avoid meetings after 15:00 are 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 13:30-14:00, and 14:30-15:00. Among these, 11:00-11:30 is selected as it is a convenient morning slot without any immediate conflicts before or after for any participant.\n\n- Raymond is free from 9:30 to 11:30, so 11:00-11:30 is within this window.\n- Billy has no meetings between 10:30 and 12:00, so 11:00-11:30 is available.\n- Donald is free from 11:00 to 12:00, so 11:00-11:30 is available.\n\nThis time also adheres to Billy's preference by ending before 15:00.\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:00:11:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}"
