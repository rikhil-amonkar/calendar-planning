You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Brian and Julia for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nBrian is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, Wednesday during 12:30 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 16:30 to 17:00, Friday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nJulia is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 13:00 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 17:00, Friday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \n\nBrian would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "After analyzing the schedules for Brian and Julia, the earliest available one-hour meeting slot that accommodates Brian's preference to avoid Monday is on Tuesday. \n\n**Key Findings:**\n- **Monday:** Although there are available slots (e.g., 10:00\u201311:00 and 11:30\u201312:30), Brian prefers to avoid additional meetings on Monday.\n- **Tuesday:** A suitable slot exists from 9:30 to 10:30. Brian is free after his 9:00\u20139:30 meeting, and Julia has no conflicts until 13:00.\n- **Other Days:** No earlier non-Monday slots exist, as Tuesday is the next day with availability.\n\n**Proposed Meeting Time:**  \n- **Day:** Tuesday  \n- **Time Range:** 9:30 to 10:30  \n\nThis slot respects Brian\u2019s preference, fits within work hours (9:00\u201317:00), and is the earliest possible non-Monday availability.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{9:30:10:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```"
