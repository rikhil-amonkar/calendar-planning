You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for John and Jennifer for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJohnhas no meetings the whole week.\nJennifer has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nJohn would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 14:30. Tuesday. Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the meeting must be 30 minutes long between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. John has no existing meetings, but prefers to avoid meetings on Monday after 14:30. Jennifer's schedule has specific busy times, leaving several 30-minute gaps.\n\nJennifer's available gaps are:\n- Monday: 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, and 14:30-15:00 (but 14:30-15:00 should be avoided due to John's preference).\n- Tuesday: 11:30-12:00.\n- Wednesday: 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, and 16:00-16:30.\n\nTo respect John's preference to avoid Monday after 14:30, the slot at 14:30-15:00 on Monday is excluded from consideration. All other gaps are valid and work for both participants.\n\nThe chosen meeting time is Wednesday from 12:30 to 13:00. This fits within the work hours, avoids John's preference conflict, and aligns with Jennifer's free time.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"12:30:13:00\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```"
