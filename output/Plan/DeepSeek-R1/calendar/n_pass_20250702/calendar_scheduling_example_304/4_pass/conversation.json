You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Christine, Janice, Bobby, Elizabeth, Tyler and Edward for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nChristine is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nJanice's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nBobby is busy on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nElizabeth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nTyler is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nEdward is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nJanice would rather not meet on Monday after 13:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT write any code or algorithms. Simply provide the answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}\n\nFor example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"
