You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Martha and Beverly for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMartha has blocked their calendar on Monday during 16:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 15:00 to 15:30, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 14:00 to 14:30; \nBeverly has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and existing schedules for Martha and Beverly, the only available one-hour slot that works for both participants within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 is on Wednesday from 15:30 to 16:30.\n\n- **Martha's Wednesday availability**: Free except for 10:00-11:00 and 14:00-14:30. Therefore, Martha is free from 9:00-10:00, 11:00-14:00, and 14:30-17:00.\n- **Beverly's Wednesday availability**: Free except for 9:30-15:30 and 16:30-17:00. Therefore, Beverly is free from 9:00-9:30 and 15:30-16:30.\n- **Common availability**: The only overlapping one-hour slot is 15:30-16:30 on Wednesday.\n\nThis slot satisfies all constraints:\n- It is a one-hour meeting.\n- It occurs between 9:00 and 17:00.\n- Both participants are free during this time.\n\nNo other day (Monday or Tuesday) has a suitable one-hour slot due to conflicts:\n- **Monday**: Beverly is only free from 13:30-14:00 (30 minutes), which is insufficient for a one-hour meeting. Martha is free except at 16:00-17:00, but no overlap exists.\n- **Tuesday**: Beverly is blocked all day (9:00-17:00), so no meeting is possible.\n\nProposed time in the required JSON format:\n\n{\"time_range\": \"15:30:16:30\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}"
