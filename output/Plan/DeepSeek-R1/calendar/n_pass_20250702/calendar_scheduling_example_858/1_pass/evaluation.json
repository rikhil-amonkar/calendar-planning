This time falls within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00, avoids all busy periods for both participants, and respects Carl's preference to avoid scheduling on Thursday.\n\n- On Tuesday, Carl is only busy from 14:30 to 15:00, so he is free from 12:00 to 13:00.\n- On Tuesday, Margaret is free from 12:00 to 13:30 (between her busy periods of 9:30\u201312:00 and 13:30\u201314:00), so 12:00\u201313:00 is fully available for her.\n\nNo other day offers a one-hour slot that works:\n- Monday has no available one-hour slot due to Margaret's extensive busy periods.\n- Wednesday has no one-hour free slot for both participants.\n- Thursday has a slot at 9:00\u201310:00, but Carl prefers to avoid it, and Tuesday is available.\n\nThus, the proposed time is Tuesday, 12:00 to 13:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:00:13:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```",
