You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Robert and Ralph for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nRobert has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nRalph is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nRobert would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the constraints and preferences provided, the earliest available time slot that works for both Robert and Ralph, while avoiding Monday as preferred by Robert, is on Tuesday from 9:30 to 10:00. \n\n- **Robert's Tuesday schedule**: Free from 9:00 to 10:30 (except the meeting at 10:30-11:00), so 9:30-10:00 is available.\n- **Ralph's Tuesday schedule**: Busy until 9:30, then free from 9:30 to 10:00 (next meeting starts at 10:00), so 9:30-10:00 is available.\n- **Duration**: 30 minutes fits perfectly.\n- **Preference**: Avoids Monday and is the earliest non-Monday slot (Tuesday is earlier in the week than Wednesday, and 9:30 is earlier than other Tuesday/Wednesday slots).\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{9:30:10:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```"
