You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Emily, Melissa and Frank for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nEmily has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMelissa is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 14:30 to 15:00; \nFrank has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFrank do not want to meet on Monday after 9:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT write any code or algorithms. Simply provide the answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}\n\nFor example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"

        "content": "Based on the constraints provided, the only available 30-minute slot that accommodates all participants' schedules and preferences within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday is **9:00 to 9:30**. Here's the validation:\n\n1. **Frank's constraint**: Frank does not want to meet after 9:30, so his availability is limited to **9:00\u20139:30**.\n2. **Emily's schedule**: Free during 9:00\u20139:30 (no conflicts with her meetings at 10:00, 11:30, 14:00, or 16:00).\n3. **Melissa's schedule**: Free during 9:00\u20139:30 (her meeting starts at 9:30, so 9:00\u20139:30 is available).\n4. **Work hours**: 9:00\u201317:00 is satisfied.\n5. **Duration**: 9:00\u20139:30 is exactly 30 minutes.\n\nNo other time works due to Frank's strict \"no meetings after 9:30\" constraint. The solution adheres to all requirements.\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:00:09:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}"
