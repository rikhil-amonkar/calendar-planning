Here's the validation:\n\n1. **Frank's constraint**: Frank does not want to meet after 9:30, so his availability is limited to **9:00\u20139:30**.\n2. **Emily's schedule**: Free during 9:00\u20139:30 (no conflicts with her meetings at 10:00, 11:30, 14:00, or 16:00).\n3. **Melissa's schedule**: Free during 9:00\u20139:30 (her meeting starts at 9:30, so 9:00\u20139:30 is available).\n4. **Work hours**: 9:00\u201317:00 is satisfied.\n5. **Duration**: 9:00\u20139:30 is exactly 30 minutes.\n\nNo other time works due to Frank's strict \"no meetings after 9:30\" constraint. The solution adheres to all requirements.\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{09:00:09:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
