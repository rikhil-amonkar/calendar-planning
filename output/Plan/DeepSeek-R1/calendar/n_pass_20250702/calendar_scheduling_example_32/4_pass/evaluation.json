This means meetings starting before 9:30 are invalid for Frank, but meetings starting at or after 9:30 are acceptable.\n\nThe available 30-minute slot that works for all participants is **13:00 to 13:30 on Monday**:\n\n- **Emily**: Free between 12:30-14:00 (no meetings).  \n- **Melissa**: Free between 10:00-14:30 (no meetings).  \n- **Frank**: Free between 13:00-13:30 (gap between meetings ending at 13:00 and starting at 13:30).  \n\nThis slot satisfies:  \n- Frank's preference (occurs after 9:30).  \n- All participants' existing schedules.  \n- Work hours (9:00-17:00).  \n- Meeting duration (30 minutes).  \n\n{\"time_range\": \"{13:00:13:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
