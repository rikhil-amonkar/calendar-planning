Thus, his only available slot is 9:00 to 9:30.\n\nThe only 30-minute slot where all three are free and within the constraints is 9:00 to 9:30 on Monday. This slot:\n- Is within Emily's free period (9:00 to 10:00).\n- Is within Melissa's free period (9:00 to 9:30).\n- Satisfies Frank's availability and constraint (only before 9:30).\n\nTherefore, the meeting time is 9:00 to 9:30 on Monday.\n\n{\n  \"time_range\": \"{09:00:09:30}\",\n  \"day\": \"Monday\"\n}",
