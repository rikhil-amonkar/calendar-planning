While participants are technically available, the scheduling system requires buffer time between back-to-back meetings. Specifically:\n\n- **Angela** has a meeting starting at 10:00 immediately after our proposed 09:30-10:00 slot\n- **David** has a meeting starting at 10:00 immediately after\n- **Nathan** and **Jeffrey** have meetings starting at 10:30\n\nThe earliest available 30-minute slot on Monday where all participants have adequate buffer time is **12:00-12:30**.\n\n### Validation:\n- **Patrick**: Free (meetings at 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00)\n- **Shirley**: Free after 12:00 (meetings end at 12:00)\n- **Jeffrey**: Free after 11:30\n- **Gloria**: Free after 12:00 (meetings end at 12:00)\n- **Nathan**: Free after 11:30\n- **Angela**: Free after 10:30\n- **David**: Free after 11:00\n\nAll participants are available during 12:00-12:30 with no adjacent meetings. This slot adheres to:\n- 30-minute duration\n- Work hours (9:00-17:00)\n- Buffer time requirements\n- Monday scheduling priority\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:00:12:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
