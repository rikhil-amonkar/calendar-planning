The available free times for both participants are determined by their existing schedules:\n\n- Jack is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n- Charlotte is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, and 14:00 to 16:00.\n\nJack has a preference to avoid meetings after 12:30, meaning meetings starting at or after 12:30 should be avoided if possible. The mutual free times where both are available for at least 30 minutes are:\n\n- 9:00 to 9:30 (30 minutes, before 12:30)\n- 12:00 to 12:30 (30 minutes, before 12:30)\n- 13:30 to 14:00 (30 minutes, after 12:30)\n- 16:30 to 17:00 (30 minutes, after 12:30)\n\nTo respect Jack's preference, the meeting should be scheduled before 12:30. The available slots before 12:30 are 9:00-9:30 and 12:00-12:30. Both are valid, but 12:00-12:30 is selected as it does not start the day too early and aligns well with the end of Charlotte's previous meeting (ending at 12:00) and before Jack's next meeting (starting at 12:30).\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Monday from 12:00 to 12:30.\n\n**Output in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:00:12:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
