You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jack and Charlotte for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJack is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nCharlotte has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00; \n\nJack would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and preferences, the meeting for Jack and Charlotte must be scheduled for 30 minutes on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The available free times for both participants are determined by their existing schedules:\n\n- Jack is busy from 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, and 16:00 to 16:30.\n- Charlotte is busy from 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, and 14:00 to 16:00.\n\nJack has a preference to avoid meetings after 12:30, meaning meetings starting at or after 12:30 should be avoided if possible. The mutual free times where both are available for at least 30 minutes are:\n\n- 9:00 to 9:30 (30 minutes, before 12:30)\n- 12:00 to 12:30 (30 minutes, before 12:30)\n- 13:30 to 14:00 (30 minutes, after 12:30)\n- 16:30 to 17:00 (30 minutes, after 12:30)\n\nTo respect Jack's preference, the meeting should be scheduled before 12:30. The available slots before 12:30 are 9:00-9:30 and 12:00-12:30. Both are valid, but 12:00-12:30 is selected as it does not start the day too early and aligns well with the end of Charlotte's previous meeting (ending at 12:00) and before Jack's next meeting (starting at 12:30).\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Monday from 12:00 to 12:30.\n\n**Output in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:00:12:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
