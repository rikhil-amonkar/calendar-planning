You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amy and Pamela for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nAmy is busy on Wednesday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00; \nPamela is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nPamela would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday before 16:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and preferences, the meeting must be scheduled for 30 minutes between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, ensuring both Amy and Pamela are available. Pamela prefers to avoid meetings on Monday and Tuesday entirely, and on Wednesday before 16:00.\n\n- **Monday**:  \n  - Amy is free all day (no conflicts mentioned).  \n  - Pamela is busy from 9:00 to 10:30 and 11:00 to 16:30, leaving only two 30-minute slots: 10:30\u201311:00 and 16:30\u201317:00.  \n  - However, Pamela prefers to avoid meetings on Monday, so this day is not preferred.\n\n- **Tuesday**:  \n  - Amy is free all day (no conflicts mentioned).  \n  - Pamela is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 and 10:00 to 17:00, leaving only one 30-minute slot: 9:30\u201310:00.  \n  - However, Pamela prefers to avoid meetings on Tuesday, so this day is not preferred.\n\n- **Wednesday**:  \n  - Amy is busy from 11:00 to 11:30 and 13:30 to 14:00, so free periods are: 9:00\u201311:00, 11:30\u201313:30, and 14:00\u201317:00.  \n  - Pamela is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, and 16:00 to 16:30, leaving free periods: 9:30\u201310:00, 11:00\u201311:30, 13:30\u201314:30, 15:00\u201316:00, and 16:30\u201317:00.  \n  - Overlapping free times for both:  \n    - 9:30\u201310:00 (both free).  \n    - 14:00\u201314:30 (Amy free from 14:00, Pamela free until 14:30).  \n    - 15:00\u201316:00 (both free).  \n    - 16:30\u201317:00 (both free).  \n  - Pamela prefers to avoid meetings before 16:00 on Wednesday. Slots before 16:00 (9:30\u201310:00, 14:00\u201314:30, 15:00\u201316:00) should be avoided if possible.\n\nThe slot that respects all schedule constraints and Pamela's preferences is **Wednesday, 16:30 to 17:00**. This is a 30-minute period within work hours, both participants are free, and it occurs after 16:00 on Wednesday, aligning with Pamela's preference to avoid meetings before 16:00 on that day.\n\nProposed time in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{16:30:17:00}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```"
