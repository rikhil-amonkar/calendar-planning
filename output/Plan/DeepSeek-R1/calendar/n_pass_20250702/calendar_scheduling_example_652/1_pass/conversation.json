You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jesse and Lawrence for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJesse has meetings on Monday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00; \nLawrence is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \n\nLawrence can not meet on Tuesday after 16:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, a meeting time that works for both Jesse and Lawrence on Tuesday is from 10:30 to 11:00. This slot is a 30-minute duration within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00, and both participants are free during this time. \n\n- Jesse is free from 9:30 to 13:00 on Tuesday, except for the busy period from 13:00 to 13:30. The slot 10:30-11:00 falls within Jesse's free time.\n- Lawrence is free from 10:30 to 11:30 on Tuesday, so 10:30-11:00 is fully available for him.\n- Lawrence cannot meet after 16:30, but this slot is well before that constraint.\n\nThe proposed time is output in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```"
