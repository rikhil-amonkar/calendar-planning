You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Patrick and Roy for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nPatrick's calendar is wide open the entire week.\nRoy is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."
