        "content": "You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Mary and Alexis for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nMary has meetings on Tuesday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:00, 15:00 to 15:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30; \nAlexis has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 10:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and the requirement to find the earliest available time for a 30-minute meeting between Mary and Alexis within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, the earliest possible slot is on Monday from 10:00 to 10:30.\n\n- **Mary's availability on Monday**: No meetings are scheduled, so she is free all day from 9:00 to 17:00.\n- **Alexis's availability on Monday**: Blocked from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, and 12:30-16:30. This leaves free gaps at:\n  - 10:00-10:30 (30 minutes)\n  - 12:00-12:30 (30 minutes)\n  - 16:30-17:00 (30 minutes)\nThe earliest gap is 10:00-10:30.\n\n- **Both free**: At 10:00-10:30 on Monday, both Mary and Alexis are free, and this is within work hours.\n\nNo earlier slot is available on any day:\n- Tuesday: The earliest potential slot is 11:30-12:00, but Mary is busy at 10:00-10:30 and Alexis has gaps later.\n- Wednesday: The earliest slot is 11:00-11:30, later than Monday's option.\n- Thursday: The earliest slot is 12:00-12:30 or later, as Mary is busy until 10:00 and Alexis has gaps starting later.\n\nThus, Monday at 10:00-10:30 is the earliest availability that satisfies all constraints.\n\n**Proposed time in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:00:10:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
