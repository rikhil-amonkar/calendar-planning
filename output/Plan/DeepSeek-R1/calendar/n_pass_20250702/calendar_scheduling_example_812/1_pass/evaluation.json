    "execution_output": "Based on the given constraints and the requirement to find the earliest available time for a 30-minute meeting between Mary and Alexis within work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, the earliest possible slot is on Monday from 10:00 to 10:30.\n\n- **Mary's availability on Monday**: No meetings are scheduled, so she is free all day from 9:00 to 17:00.\n- **Alexis's availability on Monday**: Blocked from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, and 12:30-16:30. This leaves free gaps at:\n  - 10:00-10:30 (30 minutes)\n  - 12:00-12:30 (30 minutes)\n  - 16:30-17:00 (30 minutes)\nThe earliest gap is 10:00-10:30.\n\n- **Both free**: At 10:00-10:30 on Monday, both Mary and Alexis are free, and this is within work hours.\n\nNo earlier slot is available on any day:\n- Tuesday: The earliest potential slot is 11:30-12:00, but Mary is busy at 10:00-10:30 and Alexis has gaps later.\n- Wednesday: The earliest slot is 11:00-11:30, later than Monday's option.\n- Thursday: The earliest slot is 12:00-12:30 or later, as Mary is busy until 10:00 and Alexis has gaps starting later.\n\nThus, Monday at 10:00-10:30 is the earliest availability that satisfies all constraints.\n\n**Proposed time in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:00:10:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
