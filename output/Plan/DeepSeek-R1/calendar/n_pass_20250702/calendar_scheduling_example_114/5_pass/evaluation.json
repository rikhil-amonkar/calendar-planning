This slot aligns perfectly with the boundaries of existing meetings and adheres to standard calendaring conventions (back-to-back meetings are acceptable).\n\n### Verification:\n- **Stephanie**: Free (busy only at 10:00\u201310:30 and 16:00\u201316:30).  \n- **Cheryl**: Free from 12:00 onward (11:30\u201312:00 meeting ends at 12:00; next meeting starts at 13:30).  \n- **Bradley**: Free from 11:30 to 13:30 (no conflicts).  \n- **Steven**: Free from 12:00 to 13:00 (9:00\u201312:00 block ends at 12:00; next meeting starts at 13:00).  \n\nNo other slot satisfies all constraints due to conflicts in other time windows (e.g., 11:30\u201312:30 clashes with Cheryl; 13:00+ slots conflict with Steven/Cheryl/Bradley).\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:00:13:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
