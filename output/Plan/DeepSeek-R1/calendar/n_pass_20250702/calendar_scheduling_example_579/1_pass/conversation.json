You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Christine and Helen for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nChristine has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nHelen has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nHelen can not meet on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the constraints provided:\n\n- **Christine's availability** on Monday (outside her meetings):  \n  9:00\u201311:00, 11:30\u201315:00, 15:30\u201317:00  \n- **Helen's availability** on Monday (considering her blocked times and the constraint of no meetings after 15:00):  \n  9:00\u20139:30, 10:30\u201311:00, 11:30\u201312:00, 12:30\u201313:30  \n\nThe overlapping 30-minute slot that satisfies both schedules and Helen's \"no meeting after 15:00\" constraint is **9:00 to 9:30 on Monday**.  \n\n**Reasoning**:  \n- This slot falls within work hours (9:00\u201317:00).  \n- Christine has no meetings during this time.  \n- Helen is free (her first block starts at 9:30).  \n- It occurs before 15:00, adhering to Helen\u2019s constraint.  \n\n**Output in required JSON format**:  \n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{9:00:9:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
