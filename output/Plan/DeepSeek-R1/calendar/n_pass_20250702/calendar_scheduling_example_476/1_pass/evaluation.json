To respect this preference, the slot at 13:30 to 14:00 is chosen, as it is after 12:30 and satisfies all schedule constraints.\n\n- Daniel is free all day.\n- Kathleen is free (busy only from 14:30 to 15:30).\n- Carolyn is free (last busy period ends at 13:30).\n- Roger is free and the time is after 12:30.\n- Cheryl is free from 13:30 to 14:00 (next busy period starts at 14:00).\n- Virginia is free from 13:30 to 14:30 (busy until 13:30 and next busy at 14:30).\n- Angela is free from 13:30 to 14:00 (next busy period starts at 14:00).\n\nThus, the meeting is scheduled for Monday from 13:30 to 14:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{13:30:14:00}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
