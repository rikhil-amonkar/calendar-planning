You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Judith and Timothy for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nJudith has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, Wednesday during 11:30 to 12:00; \nTimothy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nJudith would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. Wednesday before 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the constraints and preferences provided, the meeting must be scheduled for one hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. After analyzing the existing schedules:\n\n- **Monday**: Judith prefers to avoid more meetings. Available slots exist (e.g., 14:00\u201315:00 or 14:30\u201315:30), but Judith's preference rules this day out unless unavoidable.\n- **Tuesday**: Timothy has no available 1-hour slot (only 30-minute gaps exist), making scheduling impossible.\n- **Wednesday**: \n  - Judith is free after 12:00 (avoids her preference for pre-12:00 meetings).\n  - Timothy has free slots at 12:00\u201313:00 and 12:30\u201313:30.\n  - The earliest available 1-hour slot starting at or after 12:00 is **12:00\u201313:00**.\n\n**Validation**:\n- Judith: Free on Wednesday from 12:00\u201317:00 (blocked only until 12:00).\n- Timothy: Free on Wednesday from 11:00\u201313:30, so 12:00\u201313:00 is fully available.\n\nThis slot honors Judith\u2019s preferences (avoids Monday and Wednesday before 12:00) and fits both schedules.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:00:13:00}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```"
