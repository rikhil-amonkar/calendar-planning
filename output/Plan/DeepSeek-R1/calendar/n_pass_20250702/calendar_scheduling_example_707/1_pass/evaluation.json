This slot works because:\n- Ryan is free after his meeting ends at 16:00.\n- Adam is free from 16:00 to 16:30 before his next meeting at 16:30.\n- It avoids Wednesday, as Ryan cannot meet that day.\n- It respects Adam's preference to avoid Monday before 14:30, as 16:00 is after 14:30.\n\nNo other slots are feasible:\n- On Monday, slots before 14:30 (e.g., 10:30-11:00 or 13:30-14:00) are available but conflict with Adam's preference to avoid Monday before 14:30.\n- On Tuesday, the only available slot (10:00-10:30) is valid but not preferred since a better option exists on Monday after 14:30.\n- Wednesday is excluded due to Ryan's unavailability.\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Monday from 16:00 to 16:30.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"16:00:16:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
