        "content": "You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ryan and Adam for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nRyan has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 12:00 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nAdam is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nRyan can not meet on Wednesday. Adam would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:30. Tuesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the only available 30-minute slot that respects all hard constraints and preferences is on Monday from 16:00 to 16:30. This slot works because:\n- Ryan is free after his meeting ends at 16:00.\n- Adam is free from 16:00 to 16:30 before his next meeting at 16:30.\n- It avoids Wednesday, as Ryan cannot meet that day.\n- It respects Adam's preference to avoid Monday before 14:30, as 16:00 is after 14:30.\n\nNo other slots are feasible:\n- On Monday, slots before 14:30 (e.g., 10:30-11:00 or 13:30-14:00) are available but conflict with Adam's preference to avoid Monday before 14:30.\n- On Tuesday, the only available slot (10:00-10:30) is valid but not preferred since a better option exists on Monday after 14:30.\n- Wednesday is excluded due to Ryan's unavailability.\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Monday from 16:00 to 16:30.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"16:00:16:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
