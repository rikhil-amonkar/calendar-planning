You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Russell and Alexander for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nRussell is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, Tuesday during 13:00 to 13:30; \nAlexander has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nRussell would rather not meet on Tuesday before 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the constraints and preferences provided, the meeting between Russell and Alexander must be scheduled for one hour within 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday or Tuesday. After analyzing their schedules:\n\n- **Russell's Schedule**:\n  - Monday: Busy 10:30\u201311:00\n  - Tuesday: Busy 13:00\u201313:30\n  - Preference: Avoids Tuesday before 13:30 (soft constraint).\n\n- **Alexander's Schedule**:\n  - Monday: Busy 9:00\u201311:30, 12:00\u201314:30, 15:00\u201317:00 (no free 1-hour slot).\n  - Tuesday: Busy 9:00\u201310:00, 13:00\u201314:00, 15:00\u201315:30, 16:00\u201316:30. Free periods:\n    - 10:00\u201313:00 (3 hours, but Russell prefers avoiding before 13:30).\n    - 14:00\u201315:00 (1 hour free).\n\n**Solution**:\n- The only feasible 1-hour slot that accommodates both schedules and respects Russell's preference is **Tuesday, 14:00\u201315:00**.\n  - Russell: Free after 13:30, so 14:00\u201315:00 is clear.\n  - Alexander: Free from 14:00\u201315:00 (immediately after his 13:00\u201314:00 meeting).\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:00:15:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```"
