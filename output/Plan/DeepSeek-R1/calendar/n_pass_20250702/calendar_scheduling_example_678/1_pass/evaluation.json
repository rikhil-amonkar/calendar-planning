After analyzing their schedules:\n\n- **Russell's Schedule**:\n  - Monday: Busy 10:30\u201311:00\n  - Tuesday: Busy 13:00\u201313:30\n  - Preference: Avoids Tuesday before 13:30 (soft constraint).\n\n- **Alexander's Schedule**:\n  - Monday: Busy 9:00\u201311:30, 12:00\u201314:30, 15:00\u201317:00 (no free 1-hour slot).\n  - Tuesday: Busy 9:00\u201310:00, 13:00\u201314:00, 15:00\u201315:30, 16:00\u201316:30. Free periods:\n    - 10:00\u201313:00 (3 hours, but Russell prefers avoiding before 13:30).\n    - 14:00\u201315:00 (1 hour free).\n\n**Solution**:\n- The only feasible 1-hour slot that accommodates both schedules and respects Russell's preference is **Tuesday, 14:00\u201315:00**.\n  - Russell: Free after 13:30, so 14:00\u201315:00 is clear.\n  - Alexander: Free from 14:00\u201315:00 (immediately after his 13:00\u201314:00 meeting).\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:00:15:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```",
