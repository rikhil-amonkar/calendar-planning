You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Natalie and William for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nNatalie is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 11:00 to 11:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Thursday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nWilliam is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00, Thursday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

Therefore, 14:30 to 15:30 is within her free time.\n- **William's Wednesday schedule**: Free from 14:30 to 15:30, as this is explicitly a free slot in his schedule.\n\nNo other day or time slot provides a full hour where both are free simultaneously, as confirmed by the analysis of all days.\n\n**Proposed meeting time in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```"
