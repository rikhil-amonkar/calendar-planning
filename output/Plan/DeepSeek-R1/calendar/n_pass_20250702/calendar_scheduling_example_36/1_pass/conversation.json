You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ryan, Ruth and Denise for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nRyan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nRuthhas no meetings the whole day.\nDenise has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:30 to 16:30; \n\nDenise do not want to meet on Monday after 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the constraints provided:\n\n- **Ryan's busy times**: 9:00\u20139:30 and 12:30\u201313:00. Thus, Ryan is free from **9:30\u201312:30** (with the meeting needing to end by 12:30 to avoid conflict).\n- **Ruth**: No meetings, fully available from 9:00\u201317:00.\n- **Denise's busy times**: 9:30\u201310:30, 12:00\u201313:00, and 14:30\u201316:30. Additionally, Denise does not want to meet after 12:30, meaning the meeting must end by 12:30. This restricts availability to before 12:30, and within that, Denise is free only from **10:30\u201312:00** (after her 9:30\u201310:30 block and before her 12:00\u201313:00 block).\n\n**Meeting duration**: 1 hour.  \n**Work hours**: 9:00\u201317:00 on Monday.  \n\n**Analysis of available slots**:\n- **9:00\u201310:00**: Ryan is busy until 9:30, and Denise is busy starting at 9:30 \u2192 overlaps with busy times.\n- **9:30\u201310:30**: Denise is busy (9:30\u201310:30) \u2192 not available.\n- **10:00\u201311:00**: Overlaps with Denise's busy time (until 10:30) \u2192 not available.\n- **10:30\u201311:30**: \n  - Ryan: free (9:30\u201312:30).\n  - Ruth: free.\n  - Denise: free (10:30\u201312:00) and ends before 12:30 constraint \u2192 **valid**.\n- **11:00\u201312:00**: \n  - Ryan: free.\n  - Ruth: free.\n  - Denise: free until 12:00, but meeting ends at 12:00, which is when her next block starts. While technically back-to-back, it may be tight. Prefer 10:30\u201311:30 to avoid potential conflicts.\n- **11:30\u201312:30**: Ends at 12:30, which might be acceptable for the \"after 12:30\" constraint (as 12:30 is not after), but Denise is busy from 12:00\u201313:00 \u2192 overlaps with her busy block \u2192 **invalid**.\n\n**Optimal slot**: 10:30\u201311:30 on Monday works for all participants and respects Denise\u2019s preference to avoid meetings after 12:30.\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"10:30:11:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
