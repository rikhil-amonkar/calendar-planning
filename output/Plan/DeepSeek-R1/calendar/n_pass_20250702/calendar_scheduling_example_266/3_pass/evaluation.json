This slot satisfies all constraints:\n\n- **Joe**: Free after his 10:30-11:00 meeting ends at 11:00.  \n- **Keith**: Free until his 11:30-12:00 meeting starts.  \n- **Patricia**: Free during this period (next meeting at 13:00).  \n- **Nancy**: Free between her 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-16:30 blocks.  \n- **Pamela**: Free between her 10:30-11:00 and 11:30-12:30 meetings.  \n\nNo other slot works due to conflicts with Nancy's extensive 11:30-16:30 block and other participants' schedules. The solution adheres to the 30-minute duration and work hours.\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:00:11:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}",
