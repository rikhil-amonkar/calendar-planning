The earliest valid 30-minute slot where all participants are available is **Wednesday at 10:30-11:00**. This slot satisfies:\n\n- **Joe**: Free after 9:30-10:30 meeting ends at 10:30  \n- **Keith**: Free before 11:00-12:00 meeting starts  \n- **Patricia**: Free (no meetings until 11:30)  \n- **Nancy**: Free (between 9:30-10:30 and 13:00-14:00)  \n- **Pamela**: Free (between 9:00-10:00 and 11:00-12:00)  \n\nThe solution adheres to all constraints: 30-minute duration, work hours (9:00-17:00), no overlapping meetings, and earliest possible time.\n\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30-11:00}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}",
