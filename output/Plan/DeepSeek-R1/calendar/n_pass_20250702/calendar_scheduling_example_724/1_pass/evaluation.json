Here's the reasoning:\n\n- **Ruth is unavailable on Tuesday and Wednesday** (entire workdays blocked), leaving only **Monday** as an option.\n- On Monday, Ruth's available 30-minute gaps are:  \n  - 10:00\u201310:30  \n  - 12:00\u201312:30  \n  - 14:30\u201315:00  \n  - 16:00\u201316:30  \n- **Tyler must avoid meetings before 16:00 on Monday** (per preference). This eliminates all slots except **16:00\u201316:30**.  \n- Tyler has no conflicts during this time (no Monday busy periods listed), and Ruth is free (busy until 16:00 and next block starts at 16:30).  \n- The meeting fits within work hours (9:00\u201317:00) and is exactly 30 minutes.\n\n**Proposed Time in JSON Format:**  \n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{16:00:16:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
