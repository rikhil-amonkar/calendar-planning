You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amanda and Nathan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nAmanda is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nNathan is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nAmanda do not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00. Nathan can not meet on Monday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the only available time that works for both Amanda and Nathan is on Tuesday from 10:30 to 11:00. Here's the reasoning:\n\n- Nathan cannot meet on Monday, so the meeting must be on Tuesday.\n- Amanda does not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00, so the meeting must start and end by 11:00 (i.e., before or at 11:00).\n- On Tuesday before 11:00:\n  - Amanda is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 and from 10:00 to 10:30. This leaves her available from 9:30 to 10:00 and from 10:30 to 11:00.\n  - Nathan is busy from 9:00 to 10:30, so he is only available from 10:30 to 11:00 (as his next busy slot starts at 11:00).\n- The overlapping available time for both is from 10:30 to 11:00, which is exactly 30 minutes and meets all constraints.\n\nThus, the meeting can be scheduled for Tuesday from 10:30 to 11:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```"
