    "execution_output": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the only available time that works for both Amanda and Nathan is on Tuesday from 10:30 to 11:00. Here's the reasoning:\n\n- Nathan cannot meet on Monday, so the meeting must be on Tuesday.\n- Amanda does not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00, so the meeting must start and end by 11:00 (i.e., before or at 11:00).\n- On Tuesday before 11:00:\n  - Amanda is busy from 9:00 to 9:30 and from 10:00 to 10:30. This leaves her available from 9:30 to 10:00 and from 10:30 to 11:00.\n  - Nathan is busy from 9:00 to 10:30, so he is only available from 10:30 to 11:00 (as his next busy slot starts at 11:00).\n- The overlapping available time for both is from 10:30 to 11:00, which is exactly 30 minutes and meets all constraints.\n\nThus, the meeting can be scheduled for Tuesday from 10:30 to 11:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:30:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```",
