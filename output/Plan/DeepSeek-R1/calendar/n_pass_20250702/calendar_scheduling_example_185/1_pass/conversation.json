You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kimberly, Megan, Marie and Diana for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMeganhas no meetings the whole day.\nMarie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDiana is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nMegan would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 10:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the only 30-minute slot within the work hours (9:00 to 17:00) on Monday where all participants\u2014Kimberly, Megan, Marie, and Diana\u2014are available is from 15:00 to 15:30. This slot respects Megan's preference to avoid meetings before 10:00.\n\n- **Kimberly**: Free until 16:00 (next meeting at 16:00), so 15:00\u201315:30 is available.\n- **Megan**: No meetings all day, and 15:00\u201315:30 is after 10:00, satisfying her preference.\n- **Marie**: Free from 15:00 to 16:00 (after 15:00 meeting end and before 16:00 meeting start), so 15:00\u201315:30 is available.\n- **Diana**: Free from 14:30 to 15:30 (after 14:30 meeting end and before 15:30 meeting start), so 15:00\u201315:30 is available.\n\nNo other 30-minute slot works:\n- Before 10:00: Only 9:00\u20139:30 is free for all, but Megan prefers to avoid before 10:00, and a later slot exists.\n- Between 10:00 and 15:00: Overlaps with various busy times (e.g., Diana busy until 14:30, Marie busy until 15:00).\n- After 15:30: Diana is busy from 15:30, and Kimberly/Marie have meetings starting at 16:00.\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Monday, 15:00 to 15:30.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"15:00:15:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
