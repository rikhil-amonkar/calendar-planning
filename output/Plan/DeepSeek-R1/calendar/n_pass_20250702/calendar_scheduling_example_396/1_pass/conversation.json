        "content": "You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Andrea, Jack, Madison, Rachel, Douglas and Ryan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAndrea's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nJack has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:00 to 14:30; \nMadison has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nRachel is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nDouglas is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 16:30; \nRyan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

Here's the confirmation:\n\n- **Andrea**: Free all day (no conflicts).\n- **Jack**: Free from 9:30 to 14:00 (11:30-12:00 is within this period).\n- **Madison**: Free from 10:30 to 13:00 (11:30-12:00 is within this period).\n- **Rachel**: Free from 11:30 to 12:00 (exactly this slot).\n- **Douglas**: Free from 11:30 to 12:00 (exactly this slot).\n- **Ryan**: Free from 9:30 to 13:00 (11:30-12:00 is within this period).\n\nNo other 30-minute slot works due to conflicts in other time ranges (e.g., before 11:30, Douglas is busy until 11:30; after 12:00, Rachel and Douglas have conflicts).\n\nThe meeting is scheduled for Monday, from 11:30 to 12:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"11:30:12:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
