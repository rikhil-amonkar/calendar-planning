    "execution_output": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, a suitable time for the one-hour meeting between Stephanie and Betty is on Tuesday from 10:00 to 11:00. This time slot works for the following reasons:\n\n- **Stephanie's schedule on Tuesday**: She is free from 9:00 to 12:00 (except her meeting from 12:00 to 13:00). The slot 10:00-11:00 is within her free time.\n- **Betty's schedule on Tuesday**: She is free from 9:30 to 11:30 (between her meetings at 9:00-9:30 and 11:30-12:00). The slot 10:00-11:00 is within her free time and also respects her constraint of not meeting after 12:30.\n- **Stephanie's preference to avoid Monday**: This slot is on Tuesday, avoiding Monday as requested.\n- **Work hours (9:00 to 17:00)**: The meeting falls within these hours.\n\nNo other day provides a one-hour slot that satisfies all constraints:\n- **Monday**: Has potential slots (e.g., 12:00-13:00, 13:00-14:00, or 16:00-17:00), but Stephanie prefers to avoid Monday if possible.\n- **Wednesday**: No one-hour common free slot exists due to conflicting meetings (only 30-minute overlaps are available, such as 11:30-12:00 or 14:00-14:30).\n\nThus, the proposed time is Tuesday from 10:00 to 11:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:00:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```",
