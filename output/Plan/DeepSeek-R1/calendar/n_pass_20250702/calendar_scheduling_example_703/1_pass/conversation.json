        "content": "You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Stephanie and Betty for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nStephanie has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, Tuesday during 12:00 to 13:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 13:00 to 14:00; \nBetty has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, Wednesday during 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nStephanie would like to avoid more meetings on Monday. Betty can not meet on Tuesday after 12:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, a suitable time for the one-hour meeting between Stephanie and Betty is on Tuesday from 10:00 to 11:00. This time slot works for the following reasons:\n\n- **Stephanie's schedule on Tuesday**: She is free from 9:00 to 12:00 (except her meeting from 12:00 to 13:00). The slot 10:00-11:00 is within her free time.\n- **Betty's schedule on Tuesday**: She is free from 9:30 to 11:30 (between her meetings at 9:00-9:30 and 11:30-12:00). The slot 10:00-11:00 is within her free time and also respects her constraint of not meeting after 12:30.\n- **Stephanie's preference to avoid Monday**: This slot is on Tuesday, avoiding Monday as requested.\n- **Work hours (9:00 to 17:00)**: The meeting falls within these hours.\n\nNo other day provides a one-hour slot that satisfies all constraints:\n- **Monday**: Has potential slots (e.g., 12:00-13:00, 13:00-14:00, or 16:00-17:00), but Stephanie prefers to avoid Monday if possible.\n- **Wednesday**: No one-hour common free slot exists due to conflicting meetings (only 30-minute overlaps are available, such as 11:30-12:00 or 14:00-14:30).\n\nThus, the proposed time is Tuesday from 10:00 to 11:00.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{10:00:11:00}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```"
