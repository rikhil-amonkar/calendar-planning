        "content": "You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Susan and Sandra for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nSusan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, Tuesday during 11:30 to 12:00, Wednesday during 9:30 to 10:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:30; \nSandra has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00; \n\nSusan would rather not meet on Tuesday. Sandra can not meet on Monday after 16:00. Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the meeting must be scheduled for 30 minutes between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Susan prefers not to meet on Tuesday, and Sandra cannot meet on Monday after 16:00. After analyzing the free times for both participants, the available slots that satisfy all constraints are:\n\n- **Monday**: 13:00-13:30 or 15:00-15:30 or 15:30-16:00\n- **Wednesday**: 11:30-12:00 or 12:30-13:00\n\nTo respect Susan's preference against Tuesday, Tuesday is avoided. Among the available options, Wednesday at 12:30-13:00 is selected as a suitable time, as it avoids any potential lunch-hour conflicts and fits neatly within both participants' schedules.\n\n- Susan is free on Wednesday from 10:30 to 14:00, so 12:30-13:00 is within this window.\n- Sandra is free on Wednesday from 12:30 to 13:00.\n\nThus, the proposed meeting time is Wednesday from 12:30 to 13:00.\n\n**Output in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{12:30:13:00}\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```"
