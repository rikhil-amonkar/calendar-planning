        "content": "You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Eugene and Eric for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nEugene is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30, Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, Thursday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:30, Friday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30; \nEric is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, Wednesday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30, Thursday during 9:00 to 17:00, Friday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 17:00; \n\nEric would like to avoid more meetings on Wednesday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the proposed time in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}. For example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}."

        "content": "Based on the given constraints and schedules, the only feasible day and time for a 30-minute meeting between Eugene and Eric, considering Eric's preference to avoid Wednesday, is on Friday from 11:00 to 11:30. Here's the reasoning:\n\n- **Monday**: Eric is busy all day (9:00 to 17:00), so no availability.\n- **Tuesday**: Eric is busy all day (9:00 to 17:00), so no availability.\n- **Wednesday**: Both have availability (e.g., 11:30-12:00 or 16:30-17:00), but Eric prefers to avoid more meetings on Wednesday, so this is not preferred if another day works.\n- **Thursday**: Eric is busy all day (9:00 to 17:00), so no availability.\n- **Friday**:\n  - Eugene is free from 11:00 to 12:00 (busy 10:30-11:00 and 12:00-12:30).\n  - Eric is free from 11:00 to 11:30 (busy 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-17:00).\n  - Overlap: Both are free from 11:00 to 11:30, which is exactly 30 minutes and within work hours (9:00-17:00).\n\nThus, the meeting can be scheduled on Friday from 11:00 to 11:30, respecting Eric's preference and all schedule constraints.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"{11:00:11:30}\", \"day\": \"Friday\"}\n```"
