            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best time to schedule this meeting. So, the participants are Eric, Ashley, Ronald, and Larry. The meeting needs to be half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Let's go through each person's schedule step by step.\n\nFirst, Eric has no meetings all day. That's easy; he's free anytime. So his schedule doesn't restrict us.\n\nNext, Ashley's busy periods on Monday are 10:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, and 15:00-16:00. So looking for times when she's free would be outside these blocks. Let's note her available slots:\n\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 10:30-11:00 (this is a 30-minute window)\n- 12:00-12:30 (another 30 minutes)\n- 13:00-15:00 (two hours)\n- 16:00-17:00 (one hour)\n\nNow, Ronald's schedule is a bit more complicated. His meetings are at 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30, 12:30-14:00, and 14:30-17:00. So his available times are:\n\n- 9:30-10:00 (30 minutes)\n- 11:30-12:30 (one hour)\n- 14:00-14:30 (30 minutes)\n\nWait, but his last meeting ends at 17:00, so after 14:30 he's busy until 17:00. So the gaps here are the three slots I listed.\n\nLarry's calendar is blocked from 9:00-12:00 and 13:00-17:00. So he's only available from 12:00-13:00. Wait, but wait, 9:00 to 12:00 blocked, so available after 12:00 until 13:00, then blocked again until 17:00. So Larry's only free time is 12:00-13:00 on Monday.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find a 30-minute slot where all four are available. Let's check Larry's availability first because he has the tightest schedule. He can only meet between 12:00 and 13:00. So the meeting must be within that hour.\n\nNow, let's check the others during 12:00-13:00.\n\nAshley is busy from 12:30-13:00. So she's free from 12:00-12:30.\n\nRonald's schedule: he has a meeting from 12:30-14:00, so between 12:00 and 12:30, he's free. Because his previous meeting was 11:30-12:30? Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck Ronald's schedule. The original says Ronald has meetings during 12:30 to 14:00. So before that, from 12:00 to 12:30, is that free? Let's see:\n\nRonald's meetings:\n\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-11:30\n- 12:30-14:00\n- 14:30-17:00\n\nSo between 11:30 (end of the second meeting) and 12:30 (start of the third), there's an hour. Wait, 11:30 to 12:30 is free for Ronald. Because his next meeting is at 12:30. So from 11:30 to 12:30, he's free. Then, he has a meeting from 12:30 to 14:00. So during 12:00-12:30, Ronald is free.\n\nSo during 12:00-12:30, Ronald is free. Ashley is free from 12:00-12:30 as well (since her next meeting starts at 12:30). Larry is available 12:00-13:00, so 12:00-12:30 works for him. And Eric is free all the time.\n\nSo the 30-minute slot from 12:00 to 12:30 would work for everyone. Let me confirm:\n\n- Eric: Free.\n- Ashley: 12:00-12:30 is free (her next meeting is 12:30-13:00).\n- Ronald: 12:00-12:30 is free (his next meeting is 12:30).\n- Larry: Available 12:00-13:00.\n\nYes, that works. So the time range is 12:00 to 12:30 on Monday. Let me make sure there are no overlaps with any of their busy times. For example, Ashley's 12:30-13:00 is after the proposed time. Ronald's next meeting starts at 12:30. So 12:00-12:30 is good for everyone. That's the only possible time because Larry isn't available any other time except 12:00-13:00, and within that, the others have their own constraints. So this must be the correct slot.",
