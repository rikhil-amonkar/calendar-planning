            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem for Nancy and Jose. The meeting needs to be half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. The earliest possible time is preferred. Let me start by breaking down their schedules day by day.\n\nFirst, let's look at Monday. Nancy has several blocked times: 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:30, 1:30-2:00 PM, 2:30-3:30 PM, and 4:00-5:00 PM. But Jose is busy all day on Monday from 9:00 to 5:00 PM. Wait, that can't be right. If Jose is busy the entire day on Monday, then Monday is out. So no availability there.\n\nNext, Tuesday. Nancy's blocked times on Tuesday are 9:30-10:30 AM, 11:00-11:30 AM, 12:00-12:30 PM, 1:00-1:30 PM, and 3:30-4:00 PM. Jose is busy all day on Tuesday too, from 9:00 to 5:00 PM. Wait, that can't be right either. The problem statement says there is a solution, so maybe I misread Jose's Tuesday schedule. Let me check again. Oh, Jose's busy on Monday and Tuesday during 9-5? Wait, no. Let me parse the input again.\n\nWait the user wrote: Jose is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 17:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00, and Wednesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00. Oh no, Jose is completely busy on Monday and Tuesday all day. That leaves only Wednesday. But wait, the problem states there exists a solution. So the answer must be on Wednesday.\n\nSo, the only possible day is Wednesday. Now let's check both their availabilities on Wednesday.\n\nNancy's Wednesday schedule: blocked from 10:00 to 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM. So her available times on Wednesday would be:\n\nFrom 9:00 to 10:00 AM (since work hours start at 9:00), then from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM, and then from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. But wait, her blocked times are 10-11:30 and 1:30-4:00. So available slots are:\n\n9:00-10:00,\n\n11:30-13:30 (which is 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM),\n\nand 16:00 (4 PM) to 17:00.\n\nBut Jose's Wednesday schedule: he is busy from 9:00-9:30 AM, 10:00 AM-12:30 PM, 1:30 PM-2:30 PM, and 3:00 PM-5:00 PM.\n\nSo Jose's available times on Wednesday are:\n\n9:30-10:00 AM (since he's free after 9:30 until 10:00),\n\n12:30 PM-1:30 PM (between his 10-12:30 and 1:30-2:30 blocks),\n\nand 2:30 PM-3:00 PM (between 2:30 and 3:00).\n\nNow we need to find a 30-minute slot where both are available on Wednesday.\n\nLooking at Nancy's available slots and Jose's:\n\nNancy's first slot: 9:00-10:00. But Jose is busy until 9:30. So possible here is 9:30-10:00. But Jose is available 9:30-10:00, but Nancy is available until 10:00. So 9:30-10:00 would work. But wait, Nancy's blocked from 10:00-11:30. So up to 10:00, she's free. So 9:30-10:00 is possible. But does that overlap with any blocked times? Let's check.\n\nNancy: 9:00-10:00 is free (blocked starts at 10:00). Jose is free 9:30-10:00. So 9:30-10:00 is a possible slot.\n\nNext slot: Nancy's 11:30-13:30 (11:30 AM to 1:30 PM). Jose's available in 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM. So between 12:30-1:30 PM, both are free. So possible time here.\n\nThird slot for Nancy: 4:00-5:00 PM. But Jose is busy from 3:00-5:00 PM. So that's not available.\n\nAnother possible slot: Jose is available 2:30-3:00 PM. But Nancy is blocked until 4:00 PM. So 2:30-3:00 is during Nancy's blocked time (1:30-4:00 PM). So no.\n\nSo possible slots are 9:30-10:00 AM and 12:30-1:30 PM. Since the earliest time is preferred, 9:30-10:00 AM is better.\n\nWait, but the meeting duration is half an hour. So 9:30-10:00 is 30 minutes. That works. Let's confirm.\n\nNancy's Wednesday blocked until 10:00 AM. So 9:30-10:00 is within her free time (9:00-10:00). Jose is free from 9:30-10:00. So this slot works.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the earliest availability. So between the two possible days, Wednesday is the only day. So 9:30-10:00 AM on Wednesday would be the earliest possible time. But wait, the work hours start at 9:00, so 9:00 is the earliest. Let's check if there's any earlier time.\n\nWait, Nancy is free from 9:00-10:00 on Wednesday. Jose is free from 9:30-10:00. So the earliest possible time is 9:30 AM. So the meeting could be 9:30-10:00 AM on Wednesday.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the other available slot: 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM. Nancy is free from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM. Jose is free from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM. So any 30-minute slot between 12:30 PM and 1:30 PM. The earliest would be 12:30-1:00 PM.\n\nBut the group prefers the earliest availability overall. So between Wednesday 9:30-10:00 and Wednesday 12:30-1:00, which is earlier? 9:30 AM is earlier.\n\nSo the proposed time should be Wednesday at 9:30-10:00 AM.\n\nWait, but Jose is busy until 9:30 on Wednesday. His first free time is 9:30-10:00. So that's the earliest possible. Yes.",
