            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem for Mary and Alexis. The goal is to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. They want the earliest possible time. Let me break down their schedules step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each day and check the available times where both have no meetings. Let's start with Monday.\n\nMary's schedule on Monday: No meetings mentioned, so she's free from 9:00 to 17:00 except for any defaults. Wait, the problem states work hours are 9-17, so Mary is available except her meetings. But Mary's meetings on Monday aren't listed. Wait, looking back: Mary has meetings on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. So on Monday, Mary's schedule is clear except for the work hours. Wait no, the problem says \"existing schedules for everyone during the days\" and lists Mary's meetings on specific days. So for Monday, Mary has no meetings. But Alexis has blocked times on Monday: 9-10, 10:30-12, 12:30-16:30. So Alexis is busy on Monday from 9-10, then 10:30-12, then 12:30-16:30. So Alexis's available slots on Monday are 10:00-10:30 (30 minutes), 12:00-12:30 (30 mins), and 16:30-17:00 (30 mins). Since Mary is free all day, let's check these slots. The earliest possible on Monday would be 10:00-10:30. That's a 30-minute slot. So that's possible. But wait, does Mary have any conflict? No. So Monday at 10:00-10:30 could work. But let's check other days too to confirm if there's an earlier time.\n\nNow, Tuesday. Mary's meetings: 10:00-10:30, 15:30-16:00. Alexis's schedule on Tuesday: 9-10, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00. So Alexis's available times on Tuesday: between 10:00-10:30? Wait, Alexis is busy from 9-10, then from 10:30-11:30. So between 10:00 and 10:30, Alexis is free? Wait, Alexis's blocked times on Tuesday: 9-10, then 10:30-11:30. So from 10:00 to 10:30, Alexis is free except from 10:30 onwards. Wait, no. Wait, Alexis's blocked times on Tuesday are 9:00-10:00, then 10:30-11:30, then 12:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00. So between 10:00-10:30, Alexis is free. But Mary has a meeting from 10:00-10:30. So that slot is not possible. Next, after 10:30, Alexis is busy until 11:30. Then from 11:30 to 12:00, Alexis is free? Because their next block is 12:00-15:30. So 11:30-12:00. That's 30 minutes. Mary is free during that time on Tuesday? Let's check Mary's Tuesday schedule: meetings at 10-10:30 and 15:30-16:00. So yes, Mary is free from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-15:30, and 16:00-17:00. Wait, no: Mary's meetings on Tuesday are 10:00-10:30 and 15:30-16:00. So between 10:30 and 15:30, she's free. So 11:30-12:00 is within that. So on Tuesday, 11:30-12:00 is a possible slot. That's 30 minutes. But Alexis is free from 11:30-12:00? Let me check again. Alexis's Tuesday: 9-10, 10:30-11:30, then 12:00-15:30. So between 11:30 and 12:00, Alexis is free. So that's a possible slot. But that's later than Monday's 10:00-10:30. So Monday's slot is earlier.\n\nWait, but wait. On Monday, Mary is available all day, but Alexis has that 10:00-10:30 slot. But Mary's Monday is free. So that works. But let's check other days too.\n\nWednesday: Mary has meetings at 9:30-10:00 and 15:00-15:30. Alexis's Wednesday: blocked from 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-17:00. So Alexis's available times on Wednesday are 11:00-11:30. That's 30 minutes. Mary's schedule: after her 9:30-10:00 meeting, she's free until 15:00. So 11:00-11:30 is free for Mary. So that's a possible slot. But that's 11:00-11:30, which is later than Monday's 10:00 slot. So Monday is still earlier.\n\nThursday: Mary's meetings: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30. Alexis's Thursday: 10:00-12:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So Alexis's available slots on Thursday are before 10:00, between 12:00-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-16:30. Let's check. Mary's Thursday: busy until 10:00, then 10:30-11:30. So after 11:30, Mary is free. Alexis's available on Thursday: 12:00-14:00 (2 hours), 14:30-15:30 (1 hour), 16:00-16:30 (30 mins). So the earliest possible on Thursday would be 12:00-12:30, but Mary is free then. So 12:00-12:30 is a 30-minute slot. But that's later than Monday's 10:00.\n\nSo comparing all days, the earliest possible slot is Monday at 10:00-10:30. But wait, Alexis's Monday blocked times are 9-10, 10:30-12, 12:30-16:30. So between 10:00-10:30, Alexis is free. Mary is free that time. So that's a valid 30-minute slot. But wait, the problem says \"the earliest availability\". So Monday at 10:00 is earlier than Tuesday's 11:30, Wednesday's 11:00, Thursday's 12:00. So the earliest possible is Monday 10:00-10:30. But wait, Mary is available at 9:00 on Monday. But Alexis's first available on Monday is from 10:00-10:30, because Alexis is blocked from 9-10. So the first available time when both are free is 10:00-10:30 on Monday. That seems correct. But wait, wait. Mary is available starting at 9:00, but Alexis is blocked until 10:00. So the earliest possible time they can both meet is 10:00-10:30 on Monday. Yes. So that's the answer.",
