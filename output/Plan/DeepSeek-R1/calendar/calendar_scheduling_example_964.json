            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, Betty and Megan need a one-hour meeting between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday to Friday. But Betty can't meet on Wednesday or Thursday. Let's look at their schedules and find a slot.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate the days Betty can't meet: Wednesday and Thursday. So possible days are Monday, Tuesday, Friday. Wait, but the original problem says \"either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday\" but Betty can't do Wednesday and Thursday. So we're left with Monday, Tuesday, Friday.\n\nNow check each of those days for both Betty and Megan.\n\nStarting with Monday:\nBetty's busy on Monday: 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:30, 16:00-16:30, 16:00-16:30 (wait, maybe duplicate). Megan's calendar is blocked all day on Monday. So Monday is out.\n\nNext, Tuesday:\nCheck Betty's schedule on Tuesday. She's busy at 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00. So her free times on Tuesday are:\n9:00-9:30 (but work starts at 9?), 10:00-10:30 (wait, no, she's busy 10:30-11:00, so maybe between 10:00-10:30 is busy? Wait, Betty's Tuesday schedule is 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, etc. So between 9:00-9:30, she's free? But Megan's calendar on Tuesday has blocked 9:00-9:30. So from 9:30-10:00 Betty is busy. Then from 10:00-10:30, Megan is busy (her blocked times on Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30). So after that, looking for an hour slot.\n\nBetty's free on Tuesday from 11:00-12:00? Let's see. Betty's busy 10:30-11:00 and 12:00-12:30. So 11:00-12:00 is free except for 11:30-12:30? Wait, no: Betty's Tuesday schedule is 10:30-11:00, then 12:00-12:30. So between 11:00-12:00, she's free except from 12:00-12:30. Wait, the 11:30-12:30 slot? Wait, no, Betty's schedule on Tuesday is 12:00 to 12:30. So from 11:00-12:00, she's free except 12:00-12:30? Wait, 11:00-12:00 is free except if there's something else. Wait, Betty's Tuesday schedule: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00. So between 11:00-12:00, she's free except from 12:00-12:30. So from 11:00-12:00, she's free from 11:00-12:00? Wait, 10:30-11:00 is busy, then 11:00-12:00 would be free except if there's another block. Wait, no, the next block is 12:00-12:30. So Betty is free from 11:00-12:00 on Tuesday.\n\nBut Megan's schedule on Tuesday: blocked 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 12:00-14:00, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30. So Megan's free on Tuesday after 9:30 until 10:00? No, Megan's busy 10:00-10:30. Then from 10:30-12:00? Wait, Megan's next block is 12:00-14:00. So between 10:30-12:00, Megan is free except maybe between 10:30-12:00. Wait, Megan's blocked on Tuesday from 10:00-10:30 and 12:00-14:00. So from 10:30-12:00, Megan is free except for 12:00. So from 10:30-12:00, Megan is available. So between 11:00-12:00, Megan is free except starting at 12:00. So a meeting from 11:00-12:00 would work? But Betty is free from 11:00-12:00. Megan is free from 10:30-12:00 (except 10:00-10:30). So 11:00-12:00 would work for both?\n\nWait, but Megan's blocked from 12:00-14:00, so 12:00 is blocked. So if the meeting is 11:00-12:00, that would end at 12:00, which is when Megan's next block starts. So that's okay. But wait, does Megan's blocked time start exactly at 12:00? Then the meeting ending at 12:00 is acceptable. So 11:00-12:00 on Tuesday could be possible.\n\nBut let's check Betty's schedule again. Betty is busy from 10:30-11:00. So at 11:00 she's free. So 11:00-12:00 is free. Megan's free from 10:30-12:00 (since her next block is 12:00). So 11:00-12:00 works.\n\nBut wait, the meeting is one hour. So 11:00-12:00 is okay for both. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, check other times on Tuesday. After 15:00, Megan has a block until 15:30, then 16:00-16:30. Betty's busy until 15:00 (13:30-15:00) and then 16:30-17:00. So after 15:00, Betty is free from 15:00-16:30. But Megan's blocked 15:00-15:30 and 16:00-16:30. So between 15:30-16:00, Megan is free? Let's see. Megan's Tuesday blocks: 15:00-15:30 and 16:00-16:30. So 15:30-16:00 is free. But Betty is free from 15:00-16:30 except 16:30-17:00. So 15:30-16:30 would be a slot, but Megan is blocked 16:00-16:30. So 15:30-16:00 is a 30-minute window. Not enough. So the only possible time on Tuesday is 11:00-12:00.\n\nWait, but let's check again. Betty is busy from 13:30-15:00 on Tuesday. So from 15:00 onward, she's free until 16:30. Megan's free from 15:30-16:00 (since 15:00-15:30 is blocked, then 16:00-16:30). So 15:30-16:00 is a 30-minute slot. Not enough. So the only possible full hour is 11:00-12:00.\n\nNow check Friday. Betty can meet on Friday. Let's see.\n\nBetty's Friday schedule: 9:00-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:00.\n\nMegan's Friday is blocked all day (9:00-17:00). So Friday is out.\n\nSo the only possible day is Tuesday. The slot from 11:00-12:00. Both are free during that time. Let me verify:\n\nBetty on Tuesday: busy 10:30-11:00, then free until 12:00-12:30. So 11:00-12:00 is free.\n\nMegan on Tuesday: blocked until 10:30, then free until 12:00. So 11:00-12:00 is available.\n\nYes, that works.",
