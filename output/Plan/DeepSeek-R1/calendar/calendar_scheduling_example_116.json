            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. First, I need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 for Adam, John, Stephanie, and Anna. Anna prefers not to meet before 14:30. Let's look at each person's schedule and see where they overlap.\n\nStarting with Adam: he's busy from 14:00 to 15:00. So his available times are 9:00-14:00 and 15:00-17:00. But since Anna prefers after 14:30, we'll focus on times from 14:30 onward.\n\nJohn's busy periods are 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So his available slots after 14:30 would be 14:30-15:30 (but he's busy 14:00-14:30, so after that?), wait, John's next free time after 14:30 is 14:30 to 15:30? Wait, he has a meeting from 14:00 to 14:30, then free until 15:30 when he's busy again at 15:30-16:00. So between 14:30-15:30 he's free except for maybe 15:30? Wait, no. Let me parse John's schedule again. He has 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So after 14:30, he's free until 15:30, then busy from 15:30 to 16:00, then free again from 16:00 to 16:30, then busy until 17:00.\n\nStephanie's schedule: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So after 14:30, she's busy until 16:00, then free from 16:00 to 16:30, then busy again.\n\nAnna's schedule: 9:30-10:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-15:30, 16:30-17:00. She prefers not before 14:30, so we can consider 14:30 onwards. Her busy times after 14:30 are until 15:30, then she's free from 15:30 to 16:30, then busy again.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nLooking at the time after 14:30:\n\nAdam is busy until 15:00. So his next availability is 15:00 onwards. But Anna is busy until 15:30. So from 15:00 to 15:30, Adam is free, but Anna is busy until 15:30. So after 15:30, Anna is free until 16:30. But John is free from 16:00 to 16:30 (since he's busy 15:30-16:00 and 16:30-17:00). Stephanie is free from 16:00 to 16:30. Anna is free from 15:30 to 16:30. Adam is free after 15:00.\n\nSo let's check 16:00 to 16:30. All four:\n\nAdam: free (he's available after 15:00).\nJohn: 16:00-16:30 is free (his next busy is 16:30).\nStephanie: 16:00-16:30 is free (she's busy 16:30-17:00).\nAnna: 15:30-16:30 is free (her next busy is 16:30).\n\nSo 16:00-16:30 works. But the meeting needs to be 30 minutes. So 16:00-16:30 is a possible slot.\n\nAlternatively, another possible time could be 15:30-16:00. Let's check:\n\nAdam: free (after 15:00).\nJohn: busy from 15:30-16:00.\nStephanie: busy until 16:00.\nAnna: free starting 15:30. But John and Stephanie are busy here. So that doesn't work.\n\nWhat about 15:00-15:30? Adam is free, but Anna is busy until 15:30. So that's a no.\n\nAnother option: 16:30-17:00? But Stephanie is busy then, John is busy, Anna is busy. So no.\n\nSo the only possible time is 16:00-16:30. All four are available here. That fits the 30-minute requirement and respects Anna's preference for after 14:30.",
