            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Gregory, Jonathan, Barbara, Jesse, Alan, Nicole, and Catherine. Let's break down each person's schedule and see where there's overlap.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times:\n\n- **Gregory**: 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:00\n- **Jonathan**: 9:00-9:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n- **Barbara**: 10:00-10:30, 13:30-14:00\n- **Jesse**: 10:00-11:00, 12:30-14:30\n- **Alan**: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n- **Nicole**: 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-17:00\n- **Catherine**: 9:00-10:30, 12:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n\nNow, let's look for gaps where none of them are busy. The meeting needs to be 30 minutes, so we need a continuous 30-minute window.\n\nStarting from 9:00 onwards:\n\n- **9:00-9:30**: Gregory, Jonathan, Nicole, Catherine are busy. So no.\n- **9:30-10:00**: Alan is busy until 11:00. Nicole is busy until 10:30. Catherine until 10:30. So Gregory is free here, but others? Let's see. At 9:30, Alan is busy until 11:00. So Alan can't make it here. So this slot is out.\n\nNext, **10:00-10:30**: Barbara and Jesse are busy. Nicole until 10:30, Catherine until 10:30. So no.\n\n**10:30-11:00**: Jesse is busy until 11:00. Alan is busy until 11:00. Nicole is free from 10:30 onwards, but Barbara is free after 10:30. Let's check others. Gregory is free here. Jonathan is free between 9:30-12:00 except his 12:00 meeting. Wait, Jonathan's next meeting is at 12:00. So 10:30-11:00: Jesse is busy (until 11), Alan busy until 11. So this slot won't work.\n\n**11:00-11:30**: Let's see. Jesse is free after 11:00. Alan is free from 11:00 to 11:30 (his next meeting starts at 11:30). Gregory's next busy time is 11:30. Barbara is free. Nicole is free from 10:30 to 11:30? Wait, Nicole's blocked until 10:30, then from 11:30-12:00. So between 10:30 and 11:30, Nicole is free except 11:30. So 11:00-11:30: Alan is free until 11:30. Gregory is free until 11:30. Jonathan is free until 12:00. Barbara is free. Jesse is free after 11:00. Nicole is free from 10:30 to 11:30. Catherine is free after 10:30 until 12:00. Wait, Catherine's next meeting is at 12:00. So 11:00-11:30: All are free except maybe Alan? Alan's schedule says 9:30-11:00 and then 11:30-12:30. Wait, 11:00-11:30 is after his 9:30-11:00 block. So Alan is free from 11:00 to 11:30. So 11:00-11:30 seems possible. Let me check everyone here:\n\n- Gregory: free (his next is 11:30)\n- Jonathan: free until 12:00\n- Barbara: free\n- Jesse: free after 11:00\n- Alan: free 11:00-11:30\n- Nicole: free (from 10:30 to 11:30)\n- Catherine: free (from 10:30 to 12:00)\n\nSo 11:00-11:30 looks good. But wait, the meeting is half an hour. So 11:00-11:30. Let me confirm each person's availability:\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Let me check each person's schedule again to make sure.\n\nGregory: 9-9:30, 11:30-12. So 11-11:30 is free.\n\nJonathan: 9-9:30, then next at 12:00. So 11-11:30 is free.\n\nBarbara: 10-10:30 and 13:30-14. So 11-11:30 is free.\n\nJesse: busy 10-11, so after 11, free. So 11-11:30 is good.\n\nAlan: busy until 11:00, then 11:30-12:30. So 11-11:30 is free.\n\nNicole: blocked until 10:30, then free until 11:30. So 11-11:30 is free.\n\nCatherine: free until 12:00. So yes.\n\nSo 11:00-11:30 works. Let's check other possible times to make sure there's no conflict.\n\nWhat about 14:30-15:00? Let's see:\n\nBarbara is free after 14:00 (her schedule is 13:30-14:00). Jesse is busy until 14:30. So Jesse is free after 14:30. Alan is busy until 15:30. So Alan is busy here. So that's a no.\n\n15:30-16:00: Jonathan is busy 15:00-16:00. Alan is busy until 15:30, then busy again at 16:00. Catherine is free except 15:00-15:30 and 16:00-16:30. So 15:30-16:00: Catherine is free? Her schedule says 15:00-15:30 and 16:00-16:30. So 15:30-16:00 is free for her. But Jonathan is busy 15-16. So no. Also, Nicole is busy from 14:00-17:00. So Nicole can't make it here.\n\nAnother possible slot: 14:00-14:30. Let's see. Barbara is free after 14:00. Jesse is busy until 14:30. So Jesse can't. So that's out.\n\nLooking at 12:30-13:00. Let's check:\n\nGregory: free except 11:30-12. So after 12:00, he's free. But Jonathan has 12:00-12:30. Then 13:00-13:30. So 12:30-13:00 for Jonathan is free? Let me check his schedule. Jonathan's meetings are 12-12:30, 13-13:30. So 12:30-13:00 is free. Barbara's next meeting is 13:30. Jesse is busy from 12:30-14:30. So Jesse can't attend. So that's out.\n\nAnother possible time: 16:00-16:30. Let's see. Jonathan is busy 16:30-17:00. Alan is busy 16:00-17:00. Nicole is busy 14:00-17:00. Catherine has 16:00-16:30 blocked. So no.\n\nSo the only available time seems to be 11:00-11:30. Let me double-check each person again:\n\nGregory: 11:30 is his next meeting. So 11-11:30 is okay.\n\nJonathan: Free until 12:00.\n\nBarbara: No meetings during that time.\n\nJesse: Free after 11:00.\n\nAlan: Free from 11:00-11:30.\n\nNicole: Free from 10:30-11:30 (her next block is 11:30-12:00).\n\nCatherine: Free from 10:30-12:00.\n\nYes, that works for everyone. So the meeting should be scheduled at 11:00 to 11:30 on Monday.",
