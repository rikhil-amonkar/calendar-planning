Let's check each day's availability for both.\n\nStarting with Monday. Martha is busy from 16:00 to 17:00. Beverly's calendar is blocked from 9:00 to 13:30 and 14:00 to 17:00. So the only free slot on Monday for Beverly is 13:30 to 14:00, which is 30 minutes. That's not enough for an hour. So Monday is out.\n\nNext, Tuesday. Martha has a meeting from 15:00 to 15:30. Beverly's entire day is blocked from 9:00 to 17:00. No available time here. So Tuesday is impossible.\n\nNow, Wednesday. Martha's blocked periods are 10:00-11:00 and 14:00-14:30. Beverly is busy from 9:30 to 15:30 and again from 16:30 to 17:00. So Beverly's available on Wednesday is 9:00-9:30 and 15:30-16:30. Let's check Martha's availability during those times. \n\nFrom 9:00-9:30: Martha's schedule isn't blocked here. But Beverly's free from 9:00-9:30, but that's only 30 minutes. Not enough. Then Beverly is free 15:30-16:30. Martha's blocked until 14:30 on Wednesday, then free until... Her next block is 14:00-14:30, so after 14:30, she's free except for the 10:00-11:00 and 14:00-14:30 blocks. Wait, Martha's Wednesday blocks are 10-11 and 14-14:30. So after 14:30, she's free. So from 14:30 onwards, Martha is available. Beverly is available from 15:30 to 16:30. So the overlapping time is 15:30-16:30. Both are free during that hour. That's a one-hour slot. Perfect!",
