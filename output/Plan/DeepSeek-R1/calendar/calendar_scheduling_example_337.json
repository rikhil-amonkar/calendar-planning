            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for six people: John, Megan, Brandon, Kimberly, Sean, and Lori. The meeting is half an hour long and must be between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. The solution exists, so I just have to find the right gap.\n\nFirst, let's list everyone's schedules and look for a 30-minute window where none of them have meetings. Brandon has no meetings, so he's free all day. That's helpful. Let's break down each person's busy times and then look for overlaps where everyone else is free.\n\nJohn's busy: 11:30-12:00, 14:00-14:30.\nMegan: 12:00-12:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00.\nKimberly: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-14:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\nSean: 10:00-11:00, 11:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30.\nLori: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-14:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nLet's start from the earliest time and check possible slots.\n\nBetween 9:00-9:30: Kimberly and Lori have meetings. So no.\n\n9:30-10:00: Let's check. John is free, Megan is free, Brandon is free, Kimberly's last meeting ends at 9:30. So she's free from 9:30. Sean has a meeting at 10:00, so he's free here. Lori's next meeting starts at 10:30. Wait, Lori's schedule: she's free from 9:30 to 10:30? Wait, Lori's meetings are 9:00-9:30, then 10:30-12:00. So between 9:30 to 10:30, she's free except 10:30-12:00. Wait, no: her next meeting is 10:30-12:00. So from 9:30 to 10:30, she's free until 10:30. So from 9:30-10:30, Lori is free until 10:30. So 9:30-10:00 is possible. Let's check others.\n\nJohn is free. Megan is free. Kimberly is free after 9:30. Sean is free until 10:00. So 9:30-10:00 slot. Let's check:\n\nJohn: free.\nMegan: free.\nBrandon: free.\nKimberly: free (her next meeting starts at 10:00, but from 9:30 to 10:00 she's free? Wait, Kimberly's schedule: 9:00-9:30, then 10:00-10:30. So between 9:30 to 10:00, she's free? Yes, because her next meeting starts at 10:00. So 9:30-10:00 is free for Kimberly. Sean: his first meeting starts at 10:00. So he's free until 10:00. So 9:30-10:00 is free for him. Lori: free from 9:30 to 10:30. So this slot works for everyone. Wait, that seems possible. But wait, let's verify.\n\nYes, from 9:30 to 10:00, all are free. Wait, but Kimberly's schedule is 9-9:30, then 10:00-10:30. So between 9:30 and 10:00, she's free. Correct. Sean's first meeting is 10:00-11:00, so before 10:00, he's free. Lori is free until 10:30. So 9:30-10:00 works. But let's check other possible slots in case I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, after 10:00. Let's check next possible times.\n\nAfter 10:00, Kimberly is busy from 10:00-10:30. Sean is busy from 10:00-11:00. Lori is free until 10:30, but from 10:30-12:00 she's busy. So 10:00-10:30: Kimberly and Sean are busy. So that's out.\n\nNext, 10:30-11:00: Lori is busy (10:30-12:00), Sean is in a meeting (10-11). So no.\n\n11:00-11:30: Kimberly is busy until 14:30. Lori is busy until 12:00. John has a meeting at 11:30-12:00, but 11:00-11:30: John is free. Wait, John's meetings: 11:30-12:00 and 14:00-14:30. So from 11:00-11:30, he's free. However, Kimberly is busy 11:00-14:30. So during 11:00-14:30, she's busy. So any slot in that period, Kimberly can't attend. So 11:00-14:30 is blocked for Kimberly. So any time in that window is out.\n\nSo looking after 14:30.\n\nKimberly's next free time is after 14:30. Wait, her schedule: 11:00-14:30 (busy), then 15:00-16:00. So from 14:30-15:00, she's free. Let's check that window.\n\n14:30-15:00: Kimberly is free. John's last meeting ends at 14:30. So he's free. Megan's schedule: she has 14:00-15:00, then 15:30-16:00. So 14:30-15:00 is part of her 14:00-15:00 meeting. So she's busy. So that slot is out because Megan is busy.\n\nNext, check 15:00-15:30. Kimberly is busy again from 15:00-16:00. Sean has 15:00-15:30. Megan has 14:00-15:00 and then 15:30-16:00. So 15:00-15:30, Megan is free between 15:00 and 15:30? Wait, her meetings are 14:00-15:00, then 15:30-16:00. So from 15:00 to 15:30, she's free. But Kimberly is in a meeting from 15:00-16:00. So during 15:00-15:30, Kimberly is busy. So that's out.\n\nNext, 15:30-16:00: Megan is busy (15:30-16:00). Kimberly is busy (15:00-16:00). Lori has 16:00-16:30. So during 15:30-16:00, Megan and Kimberly are busy. So no.\n\nAfter 16:00, Lori is busy until 16:30. Kimberly's next meeting is 16:30-17:00. So 16:00-16:30: Lori is busy. 16:30-17:00: Kimberly is busy. So that's out.\n\nWait, what about between 14:30 and 15:00? Let me double-check. At 14:30, Kimberly's meeting ends. So 14:30-15:00, she's free. But Megan's meeting is 14:00-15:00, so she's busy until 15:00. John is free from 14:30 onwards. Sean's meeting ends at 14:00, then he has a meeting from 15:00-15:30. So from 14:00 to 15:00, he's busy (11:30-14:00). Wait, Sean's schedule: 10:00-11:00, then 11:30-14:00, then 15:00-15:30. So between 14:00 and 15:00, he's free? Wait, 11:30-14:00 is his meeting, so after 14:00, he's free until 15:00. So 14:00-15:00, Sean is free except from 11:30-14:00. Wait, no: his 11:30-14:00 meeting. So after 14:00, Sean is free until 15:00. So from 14:00-15:00, Sean is free. Wait, no: his 11:30-14:00 meeting. So he's busy until 14:00. Then he's free from 14:00 to 15:00. Then he has a meeting at 15:00-15:30. So in the 14:30-15:00 slot, Sean is free. But Megan is in a meeting from 14:00-15:00. So she's busy. So that's a conflict. Therefore, 14:30-15:00 is not possible because Megan is busy.\n\nWhat about between 16:00-16:30? Lori is busy here. So no.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the early morning slot again. The 9:30-10:00 slot. All participants except Brandon (who's free) are available. Let's confirm each person:\n\nJohn: no meetings until 11:30. Free.\nMegan: no meetings until 12:00. Free.\nBrandon: Free.\nKimberly: Her meetings are 9:00-9:30, next at 10:00-10:30. So 9:30-10:00 free.\nSean: His first meeting is 10:00-11:00. So free until 10:00.\nLori: Her meetings are 9:00-9:30, then next at 10:30. So 9:30-10:30 free.\n\nSo 9:30-10:00 works for everyone. Is there any other slot?\n\nWait, what about 16:00-16:30? Let's check:\n\nJohn: Free after 14:30. So yes.\nMegan: She's busy from 15:30-16:00. Then free until next?\nWait, Megan's schedule: 15:30-16:00. So after 16:00, she's free until 17:00? But Kimberly has 16:30-17:00. So 16:00-16:30:\n\nJohn: free.\nMegan: free (her last meeting ends at 16:00).\nBrandon: free.\nKimberly: Her schedule is 15:00-16:00, then 16:30-17:00. So 16:00-16:30 is free for her?\nWait, from 15:00-16:00, then 16:30-17:00. So between 16:00-16:30, she's free.\nSean: His schedule ends at 15:30. So free after that.\nLori: Her schedule includes 16:00-16:30. So during 16:00-16:30, she's busy. So that slot is out because Lori is busy.\n\nSo another possible time is 16:00-16:30, but Lori is busy there.\n\nAnother check: between 12:30-13:00.\n\nJohn: free (his next meeting at 14:00).\nMegan: after 12:30, her next meeting is 14:00. So 12:30-14:00 free.\nKimberly: busy until 14:30.\nSo no, Kimberly is busy.\n\nAnother window: 14:30-15:00, but Megan is busy.\n\nHmm. So the only possible time is 9:30-10:00. Let me confirm again:\n\nJohn: 11:30-12:00 and 14:00-14:30. So 9:30-10:00 is free.\nMegan: 12:00-12:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00. So 9:30-10:00 is free.\nBrandon: free.\nKimberly: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-14:30. So between 9:30-10:00, free.\nSean: 10:00-11:00. So 9:30-10:00 is free.\nLori: 9:00-9:30, then 10:30-12:00. So 9:30-10:30 is free except after 10:30. So 9:30-10:00 is free.\n\nYes, this works. So the answer should be 9:30-10:00 on Monday.",
