Let's break down their schedules and constraints.\n\nFirst, Evelyn has no meetings all day, but she doesn't want to meet after 13:00. That means we have to schedule the meeting between 9:00 and 13:00 for her. \n\nNow, Randy's schedule: he's busy from 9:00 to 10:30, then again from 11:00 to 15:30, and finally from 16:00 to 17:00. So looking at Monday, Randy's available slots are between 10:30-11:00 and 15:30-16:00. But wait, Evelyn can't meet after 13:00, so we have to focus on Randy's available times before 13:00. Let's check his morning gaps.\n\nRandy is free from 10:30 to 11:00. That's a 30-minute window. Since the meeting needs to be half an hour, this slot fits perfectly. Evelyn is available then because it's before 13:00. So the only possible time is 10:30-11:00 on Monday. That works for both. Let me double-check: Evelyn's constraint is met (before 13:00), and Randy's free during that time. Yep, that's the slot.",
