            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. So, the goal is to find the earliest available half-hour slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 where Andrew, Grace, and Samuel can all meet. \n\nFirst, I'll note everyone's schedules. Andrew and Grace have no meetings all day, so their schedules are completely open. Samuel's busy times are: 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 1:00-1:30 PM, 2:00-4:00 PM, and 4:30-5:00 PM. The meeting needs to be 30 minutes long, and they want the earliest possible time.\n\nLet's break down the available time slots by looking at Samuel's blocked periods and see where there are gaps that fit 30 minutes. Since Andrew and Grace are free anytime, the key is Samuel's availability.\n\nStarting from 9:00 AM:\n\n- Samuel is busy from 9:00 to 10:30. The next available slot after that is from 10:30 onwards. But wait, after 10:30, the next block is 11:30. So between 10:30 and 11:30, Samuel is free. That's a one-hour window. So the earliest possible here is 10:30. A 30-minute meeting could be 10:30-11:00. But wait, is there anything conflicting? Let me check. Samuel is free from 10:30 until his next meeting at 11:30. So 10:30-11:00 is open. Both Andrew and Grace are available then. That seems like a candidate.\n\nWait, but let me check other gaps. After Samuel's 11:30-12:00 meeting, he's free from 12:00 to 1:00 PM. Another one-hour slot. But 10:30 is earlier than 12:00, so the earlier one would be better. Then after 1:30 PM, he's free from 1:30 to 2:00 PM. That's another 30-minute slot. Wait, that's exactly 30 minutes. So 1:30-2:00 PM is possible. But since we're looking for the earliest, 10:30 would come first.\n\nWait, but let's recheck Samuel's schedule. The blocked times are:\n\n9:00-10:30\n\n11:30-12:00\n\n1:00-1:30 PM (13:00-13:30)\n\n2:00-4:00 PM (14:00-16:00)\n\n4:30-5:00 PM (16:30-17:00)\n\nSo the available periods are:\n\nFrom 10:30 to 11:30 (1 hour)\n\nFrom 12:00 to 1:00 PM (1 hour)\n\nFrom 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM (30 minutes)\n\nFrom 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM (30 minutes)\n\nWait, between 16:00 (4 PM) and 16:30 (4:30 PM), there's a 30-minute window. So Samuel is available then.\n\nSo the earliest possible slots are:\n\n10:30-11:30 (so 10:30-11:00 is 30 minutes)\n\nThen 12:00-1:00 PM (12:00-12:30)\n\nThen 1:30-2:00 PM\n\nThen 4:00-4:30 PM.\n\nSince the earliest is preferred, the first available is 10:30-11:00 AM. All three are available then. That should work.",
