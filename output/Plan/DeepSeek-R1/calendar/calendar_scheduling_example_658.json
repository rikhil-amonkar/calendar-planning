            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, Shirley and Albert need a half-hour meeting between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday or Tuesday. Let me start by looking at their schedules on each day.\n\nFirst, Monday. Shirley has blocks at 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 16:00-16:30. Albert is busy all day Monday from 9:00 to 17:00. Wait, that's the entire workday. So Monday is out for Albert. That means the meeting has to be on Tuesday.\n\nNow, Tuesday. Let's check their availability. Shirley's preference is to not meet after 10:30 on Tuesday. So we need a time slot before 10:30, but let's confirm their schedules.\n\nShirley is busy on Tuesday from 9:30 to 10:00. Albert is busy on Tuesday from 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00. Wait, so Albert's free times on Tuesday are before 9:30, between 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, and 16:00-16:30. But Shirley's preference is not to meet after 10:30. So the only possible time would be before 9:30 or between 9:30-10:30, but Shirley is busy 9:30-10:00. Let me see.\n\nWait, Albert's available before 9:30 on Tuesday? Because his first block starts at 9:30. So from 9:00 to 9:30, Albert is free. Shirley's only Tuesday block is 9:30-10:00, so before 9:30, Shirley is free. So 9:00-9:30 on Tuesday? Let's check if that's possible. Both are free from 9:00 to 9:30. That's a 30-minute slot. Perfect. The meeting can be scheduled there. Shirley prefers not to meet after 10:30, which is satisfied here. And Albert is free during that time. So the answer should be Tuesday from 9:00 to 9:30.",
