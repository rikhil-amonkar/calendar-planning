            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. First, I need to understand all the constraints and find a time that works for both Tyler and Ruth. The meeting needs to be 30 minutes long, scheduled between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n\nLet me start by listing out the busy times for each person on each day.\n\nFor Tyler:\n- Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 14:30-15:00\n- Wednesday: 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 16:30-17:00\n- Also, Tyler prefers to avoid meetings on Monday before 16:00.\n\nFor Ruth:\n- Monday: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-14:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n- Tuesday: Entire day (9:00-17:00)\n- Wednesday: Entire day (9:00-17:00)\n\nWait, Ruth's calendar is blocked on Tuesday and Wednesday entirely. But the problem states there's a solution, so maybe the initial understanding was wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original problem says that Ruth has blocked their calendar on Monday during various times and on Tuesday and Wednesday during 9:00-17:00. So Ruth is only available on Monday outside of her blocked times. But Tyler's constraints include avoiding Monday before 16:00. So the only possible day would be Monday after 16:00, but Ruth's blocked on Monday from 16:30-17:00. Let's check Ruth's Monday availability again.\n\nRuth's Monday blocked periods:\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 10:30-12:00\n- 12:30-14:30\n- 15:00-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nSo Ruth's available on Monday during:\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 12:00-12:30\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nNow, Tyler prefers to avoid Monday before 16:00. So on Monday, Tyler is available after 16:00. But Tyler's schedule on Monday isn't mentioned except the preference. So Tyler's available on Monday after 16:00, except if he has other meetings not listed. Since there's no mention of other blocked times on Monday, we can assume he's free except the preference to avoid before 16:00.\n\nSo on Monday, possible time slots after 16:00. Ruth has 16:00-16:30 available. Tyler's available after 16:00. So the slot from 16:00 to 16:30 would work. But the meeting duration is 30 minutes. So 16:00-16:30 is exactly 30 minutes. That fits both schedules. Let me confirm:\n\nTyler's Monday: No busy times listed except the preference. Since he wants to avoid before 16:00, after 16:00 is okay. So 16:00-16:30 is free for him. Ruth is available 16:00-16:30 (since her blocked time starts at 16:30). So that's a valid slot.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that Ruth is blocked on Monday during 16:30-17:00. So 16:00-16:30 is available. That's a 30-minute window. So that's the only possible slot. Let me check other days. Tuesday and Wednesday are blocked for Ruth entirely, so the meeting can't be there. The only possible day is Monday. So the answer must be Monday 16:00-16:30.",
