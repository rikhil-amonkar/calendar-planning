            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. First, I need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 where Lisa, Bobby, and Randy are all free, and Bobby doesn't have a meeting after 15:00. \n\nLet's list out everyone's busy times and look for gaps.\n\nStarting with Lisa's schedule:\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 10:30-11:30\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nSo her free times would be:\n- Before 9:00 (but work starts at 9)\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 11:30-12:30\n- 13:00-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nBobby's busy times:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 11:30-12:00\n- 15:00-15:30\n\nAnd he wants to avoid after 15:00. So his available times before 15:00 are:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:30-11:30\n- 12:00-15:00 (but needs to check his meetings; wait, his meetings are up to 15:00-15:30. Wait, he's busy 15:00-15:30, but he wants to avoid after 15:00. So maybe he's available until 15:00, but after that, he can't. So before 15:00, his free times are:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:30-11:30\n- 12:00-15:00 (but need to check if there's a conflict. Wait, his schedule has 11:30-12:00, so after 12:00, he's free until 15:00, except if there's a meeting. Wait, his next meeting is 15:00-15:30, so from 12:00 to 15:00 he's free except for any other meetings. Looking at his schedule, after 12:00, he has 15:00-15:30. So from 12:00 to 15:00, Bobby is free. But he can't have meetings after 15:00, so his available times are up to 15:00.\n\nRandy's schedule:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 11:30-12:30\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 14:30-15:30\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nSo his free times would be:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 13:30-14:30\n- 15:30-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nNow, we need a 30-minute slot where all three are free. Let's check possible intervals:\n\nFirst, look at Lisa's free time 10:00-10:30. But Bobby is busy 10:00-10:30. So that's out.\n\nNext, Lisa's 11:30-12:30. But Bobby is free from 12:00-15:00. However, Randy is busy 11:30-12:30. So during 11:30-12:30, Randy is busy. So maybe from 12:00-12:30, Lisa is free, Bobby is free (after 12:00), but Randy is busy until 12:30. So no.\n\nLisa's next free is 13:00-16:00. Let's check that. But Bobby can't do after 15:00. So we need to look between 13:00 and 15:00.\n\nWithin 13:00-15:00:\n\nLooking at Randy's schedule, he's busy 13:00-13:30 and 14:30-15:30. So his free times in this window are 13:30-14:30 and 15:00-15:30 (but Bobby can't do after 15:00). Wait, Randy's 14:30-15:30 is busy. So between 13:00-15:00, Randy is free from 13:30-14:30.\n\nSo during 13:30-14:30, Randy is free. Let's check Lisa and Bobby during this time.\n\nLisa is free from 13:00-16:00, so 13:30-14:30 is okay. Bobby is free from 12:00-15:00, so this time is good. So the slot 13:30-14:00 or 14:00-14:30, etc. Let's check if there's a 30-minute window here.\n\nWait, Randy is free 13:30-14:30. So from 13:30 to 14:30, all three are free. So any 30-minute window here would work. Let's pick the earliest possible, maybe 13:30-14:00. But let's confirm.\n\nWait, Lisa is free, Bobby is free, Randy is free. Yes. So 13:30-14:00.\n\nAlternatively, check Lisa's other free times. Between 10:30-11:30, Lisa is busy. Wait no, Lisa's busy 10:30-11:30. So that's out.\n\nAnother possible slot: 15:00-15:30. But Bobby can't do after 15:00, so that's not allowed. Also, Bobby has a meeting at 15:00-15:30, so he's busy.\n\nWhat about 15:30-16:00? But Bobby can't do after 15:00, so that's excluded. Also, Lisa is free until 16:00, but Bobby isn't available. So that's no.\n\nAnother possible time: 9:30-10:00. Lisa is free from 10:00, but 9:30-10:00 Lisa has a meeting until 10:00. Wait, Lisa's first meeting is 9:00-10:00, so she's busy until 10:00. So 9:30-10:00 is busy for Lisa. Bobby has 9:00-9:30 busy, but is free 9:30-10:00. However, Lisa is busy until 10:00. So that's a no.\n\nAnother slot: 10:30-11:00. Lisa is free 10:00-10:30? Wait no, Lisa has 10:30-11:30 as busy. Wait, Lisa's schedule: 10:30-11:30. So 10:30-11:30 is busy. So from 10:00-10:30, Lisa is free. But Bobby is busy 10:00-10:30. So that's conflicting.\n\nWhat about 12:00-12:30? Lisa is free from 11:30-12:30. Wait, Lisa's busy until 12:30? Wait, Lisa's schedule has 12:30-13:00 as a meeting. So from 11:30-12:30, Lisa is free? Wait, her previous meeting is 10:30-11:30, then next is 12:30-13:00. So between 11:30 and 12:30, she's free. Bobby is free from 12:00-15:00. Randy is busy until 12:30 (he has 11:30-12:30). So during 12:00-12:30, Randy is busy. So no.\n\nSo the only available slot where all three are free is between 13:30-14:30. Let's confirm:\n\nLisa: 12:30-13:00 meeting, then free until 16:00. So 13:30-14:30 is free.\n\nBobby: free from 12:00-15:00, except 15:00-15:30 meeting. So 13:30-14:30 is free.\n\nRandy: 13:00-13:30 meeting, then free until 14:30. So 13:30-14:30 is free.\n\nSo any 30-minute window here. Let's pick 13:30-14:00. Or 14:00-14:30. Either works. Since the problem says there exists a solution, so the earliest possible might be better. Let's go with 13:30-14:00.\n\nWait, but Bobby can't have meetings after 15:00, which is not an issue here. This time is well before 15:00. So this works.\n\nSo the answer is Monday, 13:30-14:00.",
