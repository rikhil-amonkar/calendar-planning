            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, we need to find a one-hour slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 where Danielle, Bruce, and Eric are all available. Let's start by listing out their busy times and then look for gaps where none of them have meetings.\n\nFirst, Danielle's schedule on Monday:\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 15:30-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nBruce's schedule:\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 14:00-14:30\n- 15:30-16:00\n\nEric's blocked times:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-11:00\n- 11:30-13:00\n- 14:30-15:30\n\nLet me break down the day hour by hour and check for availability.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n- 9:00-10:00: Danielle and Eric have meetings here. So no.\n\n10:00-11:00:\n- Danielle is free from 10:00 to 10:30, but Eric is busy until 11:00. Bruce has a meeting at 11:00-11:30. So overlapping here. Not possible.\n\n11:00-12:00:\n- Danielle has 10:30-11:00, so she's free after 11:00 until her next meeting at 14:30. Wait, wait. Danielle's next meeting after 11:00 is at 14:30? Let me check again. Yes, she has 10:30-11:00, then nothing until 14:30. So from 11:00 to 14:30, Danielle is free. Bruce has a meeting from 11:00-11:30 and 12:30-13:00. Eric is busy from 11:30-13:00. So between 11:30 and 12:30, Eric is busy, so not available. From 11:00-11:30, Bruce is busy, and Eric is available until 11:30? Wait Eric's blocked until 11:00? Wait Eric's blocked from 10:00-11:00 and then 11:30-13:00. So between 11:00-11:30, Eric is free. Let me see. So from 11:00-11:30, Danielle is free (her last meeting ended at 11:00), Bruce is busy (11:00-11:30 meeting), so that's out. Then from 11:30-12:30: Eric is busy, so that's not possible. Then 12:30-13:00: Bruce has a meeting, Eric is still busy until 13:00. So 11:00-12:00 and 12:00-13:00 slots are out.\n\nNext, 13:00-14:00:\n- Danielle is free. Bruce has no meetings here except 12:30-13:00, so after 13:00, he's free until 14:00. Eric's blocked until 13:00. So from 13:00 onwards, Eric is free? Wait Eric's blocked until 13:00. So 13:00-14:00, Eric is free. Let's check that. So from 13:00-14:00, all three are free. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nDanielle: 11:00-14:30 free (her next meeting is at 14:30)\nBruce: 13:00-14:00 free (his next meeting is at 14:00)\nEric: 13:00-14:30? Wait Eric's blocked until 13:00, then after 13:00, his next block is 14:30-15:30. So between 13:00-14:30, Eric is free except for 14:30. So 13:00-14:00, Eric is free. Bruce is free from 13:00 to 14:00 (since his next meeting is at 14:00). So 13:00-14:00, all three are available. Wait, but the meeting duration is one hour. So from 13:00 to 14:00, that's one hour. That seems possible. Wait, but Bruce's next meeting is at 14:00. So the meeting can't go beyond 14:00. So 13:00-14:00 is okay.\n\nWait, let's check again. So Bruce has a meeting from 14:00-14:30. So if we schedule 13:00-14:00, that's before his 14:00 meeting. So Bruce is free from 13:00 (after his 12:30-13:00 meeting) until 14:00. So 13:00-14:00 is free for Bruce. Danielle is free. Eric is free. So that seems like a valid slot. But wait, why wasn't that the answer in the example? Hmm. Let me check again. Wait the example solution isn't provided here, but the user says there's a solution. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the other possible slots.\n\nWait, maybe there's another slot. Let's check after 14:30. Let's see:\n\n14:00-14:30: Bruce has a meeting here (14:00-14:30). Danielle is free until 14:30. Eric is free until 14:30. So 14:00-14:30: Bruce is busy, so no.\n\n14:30-15:00: Danielle has a meeting. Eric is blocked until 15:30. So that's out.\n\n15:00-15:30: Danielle has 14:30-15:00, so she's free from 15:00 onwards until 15:30. Wait, no: Danielle's schedule says 14:30-15:00, then 15:30-16:00. So between 15:00 and 15:30, she's free. Bruce is free from 14:30 (after his 14:00-14:30 meeting) until 15:30. Eric is blocked until 15:30. So Eric is free from 15:30 onwards. So 15:00-16:00: Let's check. From 15:00-15:30, Danielle is free. Bruce is free until 15:30. Eric is blocked until 15:30. So if the meeting is at 15:00-16:00, Eric is only free from 15:30, so the meeting would overlap with his blocked time. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, Eric's blocked until 15:30. So any meeting starting before 15:30 would conflict. So maybe after 15:30. Let's check 15:30-16:30. But work hours end at 17:00. So 15:30-16:30 is possible. Let's see:\n\nDanielle has a meeting 15:30-16:00, so she's busy then. Next meeting at 16:30. So from 16:00-16:30, she's free. Bruce has a meeting at 15:30-16:00, so he's busy until 16:00. Then free until when? His next meetings? Let's check Bruce's schedule again: Bruce's meetings are 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00. So after 16:00, he's free until the end of the day. Eric is free from 15:30 onwards. So possible slots:\n\n16:00-17:00. Let's check:\n\nDanielle has 16:30-17:00, so she's free from 16:00-16:30. Then she's busy from 16:30-17:00. Bruce is free from 16:00 onwards. Eric is free from 15:30 onwards. So the slot 16:00-17:00 is possible, but only for 30 minutes (16:00-16:30 for Danielle). So a one-hour slot would need to start at 16:00, but Danielle can only do until 16:30. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe 15:00-16:00? Let's check again. Danielle is free from 15:00-15:30 (after her 14:30-15:00 meeting) and then again from 15:30-16:00 she has a meeting. So 15:00-15:30 free, 15:30-16:00 busy. Bruce is free from 14:30 to 15:30, then busy 15:30-16:00. Eric is blocked until 15:30. So 15:00-16:00 would conflict with Danielle and Bruce's 15:30 meetings, and Eric can't join until 15:30. So even if we try 15:30-16:30, Danielle is busy 15:30-16:00, so that's no good.\n\nWait, going back to the earlier slot: 13:00-14:00. All three are available here. Danielle is free, Bruce is free (his next meeting is at 14:00), and Eric is free from 13:00-14:30. So 13:00-14:00 works. But wait, let me cross-verify each person's schedule again.\n\nDanielle's schedule: her meetings end at 11:00, then next at 14:30. So from 11:00 to 14:30, she's free. So 13:00-14:00 is within that window. Yes.\n\nBruce's schedule: his meetings are up to 13:00 (12:30-13:00). Then his next meeting is at 14:00. So between 13:00 and 14:00, he's free. Correct.\n\nEric's schedule: he's blocked until 13:00 (11:30-13:00). So after 13:00, he's free until 14:30. So 13:00-14:00 is okay for him.\n\nSo this seems like a valid slot. But why did the user mention that the example solution exists, but perhaps there's another slot. Let me check again. Maybe I missed a possible slot.\n\nAlternatively, check between 11:00-11:30. Danielle is free after 11:00. Bruce has a meeting 11:00-11:30. So that's out.\n\nWhat about 10:00-11:00? Eric is busy here. So no.\n\nHow about 10:30-11:00? That's only 30 minutes, but we need an hour. So not enough.\n\nWait, maybe after 14:30. Let's see:\n\nAt 14:30-15:00, Danielle has a meeting. Eric is blocked until 15:30. So that's no good.\n\n15:30-16:00: Danielle and Bruce have meetings. So no.\n\n16:00-16:30: Danielle is free (her next meeting is 16:30). Bruce is free. Eric is free. So 16:00-17:00 is possible for Bruce and Eric, but Danielle can only do until 16:30. So a meeting from 16:00-17:00 would conflict with Danielle's 16:30 meeting. So the latest possible start time for a one-hour meeting for Danielle is 15:30 (but she's busy then), so no.\n\nWait, Danielle's free periods:\n\nFrom 11:00-14:30 (after 11:00 to 14:30, since her next meeting is 14:30-15:00).\n\nFrom 15:00-15:30 (between 15:00-15:30, she's free).\n\nFrom 16:00-16:30 (after 15:30-16:00 meeting, next is 16:30).\n\nSo the possible slots for Danielle are:\n\n11:00-14:30 (except 10:30-11:00 is already covered).\n\nWait, Danielle's meetings:\n\n9:00-10:00\n\n10:30-11:00\n\nThen next at 14:30.\n\nSo between 11:00 and 14:30, she's free.\n\nSo the 13:00-14:00 slot works for Danielle, Bruce, and Eric. That seems to be the only possible one-hour slot where all three are free.",
