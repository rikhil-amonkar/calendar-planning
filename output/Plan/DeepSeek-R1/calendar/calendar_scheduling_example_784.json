            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. So, the goal is to find a one-hour meeting time between Judith and Timothy on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, within 9:00 to 17:00 work hours. Both have their existing blocked times, and Judith has some preferences to avoid certain times. Let me start by listing out their blocked times and then look for available slots.\n\nFirst, let's note Judith's blocked times. On Monday, she's busy from 12:00 to 12:30. On Wednesday, she's blocked from 11:30 to 12:00. Also, she prefers to avoid more meetings on Monday and Wednesday before 12:00. So even if there's a slot on Monday, it's better to avoid it if possible. For Wednesday, before 12:00 is not preferred, but after 12:00 is okay.\n\nNow, Timothy's blocked times are more extensive. Let's break them down day by day.\n\nOn Monday:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:30-11:30\n- 12:30-14:00\n- 15:30-17:00\n\nSo his available slots on Monday are:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 11:30-12:30 (but Judith is blocked 12:00-12:30)\nWait, Judith's Monday block is 12:00-12:30. So if we consider overlapping times, on Monday, between Judith and Timothy, possible slots would need to be when neither is blocked. Let's see:\n\nPossible Monday times:\nFrom 9:00-9:30: Timothy is available (his block starts at 9:30). Judith hasn't blocked this time. But Judith prefers to avoid Monday meetings. So maybe this is possible but not preferred.\n\n10:00-10:30: Timothy is free here. Judith's available. But Judith prefers not to have Monday meetings. So if there's another day available, better to choose that.\n\n11:30-12:00: Timothy is free (his block is 10:30-11:30, so after 11:30 he's free until 12:30). But Judith is available until 12:00. So 11:30-12:30 is Timothy's available, but Judith is blocked from 12:00-12:30. So the overlapping available time here would be 11:30-12:00. But that's only 30 minutes, not enough for an hour. So that's not possible.\n\nThen after 14:00 to 15:30: Timothy is available from 14:00 (since his block ends at 14:00) until 15:30. Judith hasn't blocked any time here. So 14:00-15:30 is available for both? Let me check:\n\nJudith's Monday blocks are only 12:00-12:30. So from 14:00-15:30, she's free. Timothy's blocks on Monday end at 14:00, so he's free from 14:00 until 15:30. So that's 1.5 hours. So a one-hour slot here is possible, like 14:00-15:00 or 14:30-15:30. But Judith prefers to avoid Monday. So maybe we can look for another day first.\n\nNow, Tuesday:\n\nJudith's schedule on Tuesday isn't mentioned, so she's free all day except her preferences. Wait, no, the problem states that the existing schedules are given. Let me check again. The problem says Judith's existing schedule: blocked on Monday 12-12:30 and Wednesday 11:30-12:00. So on Tuesday, she has no blocks. Timothy's Tuesday schedule is blocked from 9:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-17:00. So his available times on Tuesday are:\n\nFrom 9:00-9:30 (but Judith's work hours start at 9:00, so that's possible), but the meeting needs to be an hour. 9:00-9:30 is only 30 minutes. Then between 13:00-13:30 (30 minutes), and 14:00-14:30 (30 minutes). So Timothy only has half-hour slots on Tuesday. Therefore, Tuesday doesn't have a one-hour slot where both are available. Because even though Judith is free all day on Tuesday, Timothy's blocks make it impossible. So Tuesday is out.\n\nNow Wednesday:\n\nJudith is blocked 11:30-12:00. She prefers to avoid Wednesday before 12:00. So after 12:00 is better. Let's check Timothy's Wednesday blocks:\n\nTimothy's Wednesday blocks: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 13:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nSo his available times on Wednesday are:\n\nFrom 9:30-10:30 (but 10:30-11:00 is blocked, so 9:30-10:30 is available?), wait, let's parse his blocks again.\n\nHis Wednesday blocked times are:\n\n9:00-9:30,\n\n10:30-11:00,\n\n13:30-14:30,\n\n15:00-15:30,\n\n16:00-16:30.\n\nSo the available slots on Wednesday for Timothy would be:\n\n9:30-10:30,\n\n11:00-13:30,\n\n14:30-15:00,\n\n15:30-16:00,\n\n16:30-17:00.\n\nBut Judith's available on Wednesday except 11:30-12:00. Also, she prefers to avoid Wednesday before 12:00. So we need to look for a time on Wednesday after 12:00.\n\nLooking at Timothy's available after 12:00 on Wednesday:\n\n11:00-13:30 (but Judith is blocked 11:30-12:00). So from 12:00-13:30, Timothy is available (since his block ends at 11:00?), wait, no. Wait, Timothy's Wednesday block is 10:30-11:00. Then he's free from 11:00 to 13:30 (his next block is 13:30-14:30). So from 11:00-13:30, Timothy is available. But Judith is available on Wednesday except 11:30-12:00. Also, she prefers to avoid before 12:00. So after 12:00, Judith is free. So possible slots on Wednesday after 12:00:\n\nFrom 12:00-13:30 (Timothy's available until 13:30). Judith is available from 12:00 onwards (since her block is 11:30-12:00). So the overlapping time here is 12:00-13:30. We need a one-hour slot here. So possible options:\n\n12:00-13:00, but Judith is available, Timothy is available. But wait, Timothy's next block starts at 13:30. So 12:00-13:00 is okay. But let's check if that's the case. Let me confirm:\n\nTimothy's blocks on Wednesday: 13:30-14:30. So from 12:00 to 13:30, he's free. Judith is free from 12:00 onward (her block ends at 12:00). So 12:00-13:00 would work. But let's check other possibilities. Alternatively, 13:00-14:00. Wait, no, because Timothy is blocked from 13:30-14:30. So 13:00-14:00 would overlap with his block starting at 13:30. So the latest they can start is 12:30 to end at 13:30. So 12:30-13:30 is possible. Wait, but Judith is available then. Let's see:\n\nIf the meeting is 12:00-13:00: both available.\n\nAlternatively, 12:30-13:30: but Timothy is available until 13:30, so that's okay. Judith is available. So either of these would work. But Judith's preference is to avoid Wednesday before 12:00. So 12:00 and after is okay. So both these times are acceptable.\n\nAnother possible slot on Wednesday after 12:00 is 14:30-15:00 (Timothy's available 14:30-15:00, but that's only 30 minutes). Then 15:30-16:00 (30 minutes), and 16:30-17:00 (30 minutes). So those are half-hour slots. The only full hour available on Wednesday after 12:00 is 12:00-13:00 and 12:30-13:30 (if possible). Wait, 12:00-13:00 is a full hour, and both are available.\n\nWait, Judith is available from 12:00 onwards. Timothy is available from 11:00 to 13:30. So 12:00-13:00 is fully available for both. That's a one-hour slot. That works. Also, Judith's preference to avoid Wednesday before 12:00 is satisfied here.\n\nSo Wednesday 12:00-13:00 is a possible slot. Are there any other slots?\n\nAnother option is looking at 14:30-15:00, but that's only 30 minutes. Then from 15:30-16:00, again 30 minutes. So the only possible full hour is 12:00-13:00. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, let's check Monday again, even though Judith prefers to avoid it. On Monday, after 14:00, Timothy is available until 15:30. Judith is available then. So 14:00-15:00 or 14:30-15:30. But Judith prefers not to have more meetings on Monday. So if there's a Wednesday option, that's better. Since Wednesday 12:00-13:00 is available, that's preferable.\n\nTherefore, the optimal time is Wednesday from 12:00 to 13:00. That fits within both schedules and adheres to Judith's preferences.",
