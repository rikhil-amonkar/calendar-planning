            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Bradley, Teresa, Elizabeth, and Christian. Let me start by listing everyone's busy times and then look for gaps where all four are free.\n\nFirst, Bradley's busy periods on Monday are:\n9:30-10:00,\n12:30-13:00,\n13:30-14:00,\n15:30-16:00.\n\nTeresa's meetings are:\n10:30-11:00,\n12:00-12:30,\n13:00-13:30,\n14:30-15:00.\n\nElizabeth's schedule has:\n9:00-9:30,\n10:30-11:30,\n13:00-13:30,\n14:30-15:00,\n15:30-17:00.\n\nChristian is busy from:\n9:00-9:30,\n10:30-17:00.\n\nSo, Christian is completely booked from 10:30 onward until 5 PM. That means the only possible time for Christian is between 9:30 and 10:30, because his first meeting ends at 9:30, and the next starts at 10:30. Wait, but Christian's blocked time is 10:30 to 17:00, right? So Christian is free from 9:30 to 10:30.\n\nSo the possible window is 9:30-10:30. Let's check if the others have availability in that time.\n\nLooking at Bradley: he has 9:30-10:00 blocked. So Bradley is free from 9:00 to 9:30 (but Christian is busy until 9:30), and then from 10:00 to 10:30. Because Christian's available until 10:30, so between 10:00 and 10:30, Christian is free. Let's check Teresa and Elizabeth here.\n\nTeresa's first meeting is at 10:30. So before that, she's free from 9:00 up to 10:30. Except her first meeting is 10:30-11:00, so before 10:30 she's free. Wait, Teresa's busy at 10:30-11:00, so before 10:30, she's free. So in the 10:00-10:30 slot, Teresa is available.\n\nElizabeth's schedule: she has 9:00-9:30, then 10:30-11:30. So between 9:30 and 10:30, she's free except from 10:30 onwards. Wait, her next meeting is at 10:30. So from 9:30 to 10:30, Elizabeth is free except maybe overlapping? Let me check. Her 10:30-11:30 is a meeting. So up until 10:30, she's free from 9:30. So between 10:00 and 10:30, Elizabeth is free.\n\nSo putting it all together: Christian is free from 9:30 to 10:30. Bradley is free from 10:00 to 10:30 (since his 9:30-10:00 is blocked). Teresa is free from 10:00 to 10:30. Elizabeth is free from 9:30 to 10:30, except her next meeting starts at 10:30, so up until 10:30.\n\nSo the 30-minute slot could be from 10:00 to 10:30. Let me check all conflicts:\n\nBradley: 10:00-10:30 is free (his next is 12:30). Teresa: free until 10:30. Elizabeth: free. Christian: free until 10:30. So 10:00-10:30 works for everyone. That's a 30-minute slot. So the answer should be Monday, 10:00-10:30.",
