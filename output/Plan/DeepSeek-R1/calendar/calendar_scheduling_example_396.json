            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, I need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Andrea, Jack, Madison, Rachel, Douglas, and Ryan. Let's break down each person's schedule and see where there's overlap.\n\nFirst, Andrea is free all day, so no problem there. Jack has meetings from 9-9:30 and 14:00-14:30. Madison's busy periods are 9:30-10:30, 13:00-14:00, 15:00-15:30, 16:30-17:00. Rachel's busy times are 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-13:30, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00. Douglas is busy 9:00-11:30, 12:00-16:30. Ryan has blocked 9:00-9:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-17:00.\n\nLet me list all the busy times and look for gaps. Starting from 9:00. From 9:00 to 9:30: Jack and Ryan are busy. Then 9:30-10:30: Madison and Rachel are busy. 10:30-11:00: Douglas is still busy until 11:30. Next, 11:30-12:00: Let's check. Douglas is free here because he's busy 9-11:30 and then again at 12. Wait, Douglas is busy until 11:30, then free from 11:30 to 12:00? Because his next meeting starts at 12. So 11:30-12:00 might be a possible slot. Let's check others. Jack is free after 9:30 except 14:00-14:30. Madison is free from 10:30-13:00 except for her 9:30-10:30 and then next at 13:00. Rachel is busy until 11:30 at 11:00-11:30. Wait, Rachel's schedule says 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, so after 11:30, she's free until 12:00. So 11:30-12:00 might work. But wait, Douglas is free from 11:30-12:00. Let's check others. Jack is free then. Madison is free from 10:30-13:00 except 13:00-14:00. So 11:30-12:00: Andrea is free, Jack is free, Madison is free (since her next meeting is at 13:00), Rachel is free (after 11:30 until 12:00), Douglas is free, and Ryan is free (since he's only busy 9:00-9:30, 13:00-14:00, and 14:30-17:00). So this 30-minute slot from 11:30 to 12:00 could work. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, Rachel's schedule shows she's busy 12:00-13:30. So 12:00 is the start of her next meeting. So 11:30-12:00 is free for her. Douglas is busy until 11:30, then free until 12:00. So that's a 30-minute window. All others are available. Let me check Ryan's schedule. He's free from 9:30 until 13:00, except for 9:00-9:30. So 11:30-12:00 is okay for him. Yes. So that's a possible slot.\n\nAnother possible time: After Douglas becomes free at 16:30. Because Douglas is busy until 16:30. Then from 16:30 to 17:00. But Madison is busy 16:30-17:00. Rachel is busy 16:00-17:00. Ryan is busy 14:30-17:00. So that's no good.\n\nLooking at 15:30-16:00. Let's see: Douglas is busy until 16:30. So no. What about 14:30-15:00? Rachel is busy until 15:30. Ryan is busy starting at 14:30. So that's out.\n\nAnother option: 14:00-14:30. Jack has a meeting then. Madison is busy until 14:00. So after 14:00, Madison is free until 15:00. But Jack is in a meeting until 14:30. So 14:30 might be a possible start time. But Ryan is busy from 14:30 onwards. So that's not possible.\n\nWhat about 15:30-16:00? Douglas is busy until 16:30. Rachel is busy until 15:30, then from 16:00. So between 15:30-16:00, Rachel is free? Let's check Rachel's schedule: 14:30-15:30 and 16:00-17:00. So 15:30-16:00 is free for her. But Douglas is busy until 16:30. So that's a problem. So 15:30-16:00: Douglas is busy, so can't do.\n\nSo the only possible slot seems to be 11:30-12:00. Let's confirm each participant's availability during that time:\n\n- Andrea: Free.\n- Jack: No meetings between 9:30-14:00 except 9:00-9:30 and 14:00-14:30. So 11:30-12:00 is free.\n- Madison: Free from 10:30-13:00. So yes.\n- Rachel: Free from 11:30-12:00 (since her next meeting starts at 12:00).\n- Douglas: Free from 11:30-12:00 (busy until 11:30, then next at 12:00).\n- Ryan: Free from 9:30-13:00. So 11:30-12:00 is good.\n\nYes, that works. So the answer should be Monday, 11:30 to 12:00.",
