Let me list everyone's blocked times first.\n\nDoris is busy from 9-11, 13:30-14:00, and 16-16:30. Theresa is busy 10-12. Christian is free all day. Terry has a lot of blocks: 9:30-10, 11:30-12, 12:30-13, 13:30-14, 14:30-15, and 15:30-17. Carolyn's blocked times are 9-10:30, 11-11:30, 12-13, 13:30-14:30, 15-17. Kyle is busy 9-9:30, 11:30-12, 12:30-13, 14:30-17.\n\nChristian has no conflicts, so we don't need to worry about him. The others have overlapping blocks. Let's look for a 30-minute window where none of them are blocked.\n\nStarting from 9:00. Doris is busy until 11, Theresa until 12, but Carolyn is free after 10:30. Wait, Theresa is busy until 12 except maybe early. Let's check after 12.\n\nFrom 12:00 to 12:30: Theresa is free (her block ends at 12). Terry is blocked 12:30-13, so before that. Carolyn is blocked until 13. Wait, Carolyn is blocked 12-13. So 12-13 is out. Then 13:00 to 13:30. Let's check.\n\nAt 13:00-13:30: Doris is free (her block is 13:30-14). Theresa is free. Terry has a block from 12:30-13, so at 13:00, he's free. Carolyn is blocked until 13:00, so from 13:00 she might be free until 13:30. Wait Carolyn's blocked 12-13, so at 13:00 she's free. Her next block is 13:30-14:30. So 13:00-13:30: Carolyn is free. Kyle's blocked at 12:30-13, so after 13:00, he's free until 14:30. So 13:00-13:30? Let's check each person:\n\nDoris: 13:00-13:30 is free (her next block is 13:30-14:00).\nTheresa: free.\nTerry: 13:00-13:30. Terry's blocks: 12:30-13:00. So after 13:00, he's free until 13:30. Then blocked again at 13:30-14:00. So 13:00-13:30 is free.\nCarolyn: 13:00-13:30 is free, as her block is 12-13 and next is 13:30-14:30.\nKyle: 13:00-14:30 is free except 12:30-13:00. So 13:00-14:30 is free. So 13:00-13:30 looks good. But let's check everyone.\n\nYes, all are free from 13:00 to 13:30. That's a 30-minute window. Let me verify again.\n\nDoris: 9-11, 13:30-14, 16-16:30. So 13:00-13:30 is free.\nTheresa: 10-12. So after 12, free.\nChristian: free.\nTerry: 13:00-13:30. His blocks at 12:30-13:00 and 13:30-14:00. So 13:00-13:30 is free.\nCarolyn: 12-13 is blocked, so after 13:00 until 13:30 is free.\nKyle: 12:30-13:00 blocked. So 13:00-14:30 is free. \n\nSo yes, 13:00-13:30 works for everyone. Let me check if there's any other possible slots. For example, after 14:30. Terry is blocked 14:30-15:00. Carolyn is blocked 15-17. Kyle is blocked from 14:30 onwards. So 14:30-15:00 is no good. Before that, maybe between 15:00-15:30. But Terry is blocked at 15:30-17, but 15:00-15:30? Let's see. Terry's blocks: 14:30-15:00, so after 15:00 he's free until 15:30. Carolyn is blocked from 15:00-17:00. So 15:00-15:30: Carolyn is blocked. So that's out.\n\nHow about 14:00-14:30? Doris is free (her block ends at 14:00). Theresa is free. Terry has a block 13:30-14:00, so after 14:00 he's free until 14:30. Carolyn is blocked until 14:30 (13:30-14:30). So Carolyn is blocked until 14:30, so 14:00-14:30 is no good.\n\nAnother possible time: between 11:00-11:30. Let's check. Doris is free after 11:00. Theresa is blocked until 12:00. So Theresa can't do 11-12. So that's out.\n\nSo the only available slot seems to be 13:00-13:30 on Monday.",
