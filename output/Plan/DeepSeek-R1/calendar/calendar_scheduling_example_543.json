            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for James and John on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The meeting should last one hour. Let me check their schedules.\n\nFirst, James's busy times on Monday are 11:30-12:00 and 14:30-15:00. John has a lot more busy slots: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, and 14:30-16:30. So I need to find a one-hour window where both are free.\n\nLet's break down the day into possible slots. Starting from 9:00. James is free until 11:30, but John is busy until 11:00. So between 9:00 and 9:30, John is busy? Wait, John is busy from 9:30 to 11:00. So from 9:00 to 9:30, John is free. James is free then too. That's a 30-minute window, but the meeting needs an hour. So that's not enough.\n\nNext, after 11:00. John is free from 11:00 to 11:30. But James is busy from 11:30 to 12:00. Wait, James's blocked time is 11:30-12:00. So from 11:00 to 11:30, James is free. But John is busy until 11:00, then free until 11:30. So 11:00-11:30 is available for both. But that's only 30 minutes. Not enough.\n\nThen, after 12:00. James is free from 12:00 to 14:30, except John's schedule. John is busy from 12:30 to 13:30. So let's check the gaps here. From 12:00 to 12:30, John is busy until 12:30? Wait, John is busy from 12:30 to 13:30. Wait, no. Wait John's busy periods: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:30-16:30. So after 12:00, John is busy from 12:30-13:30. So between 12:00 and 12:30, John is free. But James is free then. So that's a 30-minute slot again. Not enough.\n\nThen, from 13:30 to 14:30. John is free from 13:30 to 14:30. James is free until 14:30. So 13:30-14:30 is a one-hour window where both are available. Wait, James is free until 14:30, so that slot works. Let me check again. James's blocked time is 14:30-15:00. So 13:30-14:30 is entirely free for James. John's busy until 13:30, then free until 14:30. So yes, 13:30-14:30 is a possible slot. That's one hour. But wait, John is busy from 14:30-16:30, so after 14:30. So that slot is good. \n\nAnother possible time could be after 16:30 for John. John is free from 16:30 to 17:00. James is free after 15:00, but until when? The work hours end at 17:00. So from 16:30 to 17:00, that's 30 minutes. Not enough. So the only possible one-hour slot is 13:30-14:30. Let me confirm. James is free from 12:00 to 14:30, except the 14:30-15:00 block. John is free from 13:30 to 14:30. So yes, that's the only hour-long slot available.",
