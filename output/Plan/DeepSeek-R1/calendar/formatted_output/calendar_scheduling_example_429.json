            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for seven people: Judy, Olivia, Eric, Jacqueline, Laura, Tyler, and Lisa. The meeting is on Monday, between 9:00 and 17:00, and it needs to be half an hour long. All right, let's start by listing everyone's busy times and then look for a 30-minute slot where none of them are busy.\n\nFirst, Judy's busy from 13:00-13:30 and 16:00-16:30. Olivia has three blocks: 10:00-10:30, 12:00-13:00, and 14:00-14:30. Eric is free all day, so he's not a problem. Jacqueline has meetings at 10:00-10:30 and 15:00-15:30. Laura's schedule is quite packed: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, and 15:30-17:00. Tyler is busy at 9:00-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, and 15:30-17:00. Lisa's blocked times are 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, and 16:00-17:00.\n\nLet me list all the busy times in order. Let's break down each hour from 9 to 17 and see where everyone is free.\n\nStarting at 9:00. Laura is busy until 10:00, Tyler until 10:00, Lisa starts at 9:30-10:30. So 9:00-9:30: Laura and Tyler are busy. From 9:30-10:00: Laura, Tyler, Lisa are busy. So 9-10 is out.\n\nNext, 10:00-10:30. Judy is free, but Olivia is busy here, Jacqueline is busy, Laura is busy until 10:00 but then from 10:30-12:00 she's busy again. Wait, Laura's schedule says 9-10, then 10:30-12. So between 10:00-10:30, Laura is free? Wait, no. Wait, Laura is busy 9-10, then 10:30-12. So 10:00-10:30, she's free? Let me check that again. Yes, Laura's busy periods are 9-10, then 10:30-12. So between 10:00 and 10:30, Laura is free. But Olivia and Jacqueline are busy at 10:00-10:30. So that slot is no good.\n\nFrom 10:30-11:00. Let's see. Judy is free. Olivia's next busy is 12-13. Jacqueline is free after 10:30. Laura is busy from 10:30-12. So Laura is busy here. So 10:30-12 is busy for Laura. So 10:30-11:00, Laura is busy. So that's out.\n\n11:00-11:30. Tyler has a meeting here (11-11:30), Lisa too. So that's blocked.\n\n11:30-12:00. Let's check. Olivia is free until 12:00. Laura is busy until 12. Tyler is free from 11:30 to 12:30? Wait, Tyler's next busy is 12:30-13:00. So 11:30-12:30, Tyler is free except 12:30. So 11:30-12:00: Are there any conflicts? Let's see. Judy is free. Olivia is free until 12. Eric free. Jacqueline is free. Laura is busy (until 12). So Laura is busy until 12, so 11:30-12:00, Laura is still busy. So that's out.\n\n12:00-12:30: Olivia is busy from 12-13:00. Lisa is busy 12:00-12:30. Tyler is free until 12:30. So this slot is no good.\n\n12:30-13:00: Tyler is busy here (12:30-13:00). Lisa is busy until 12:30, then from 13:00. Olivia is busy until 13:00. Judy is free except 13:00-13:30. So 12:30-13:00: Olivia is busy, Tyler is busy. So that's out.\n\n13:00-13:30: Judy is busy, Olivia is free after 13:00? Wait Olivia is busy from 12-13:00. So 13:00 onwards, Olivia is free. But Judy is busy 13:00-13:30. Laura is also busy 13:00-13:30. Lisa is busy 13:00-13:30. So that slot is blocked.\n\n13:30-14:00: Let's check. Judy is free. Olivia is free. Jacqueline is free. Laura is free (her next busy is 14:30-15:00). Tyler is free until 14:00 (his next busy is 14:00-14:30). Lisa is free here (after 13:30 until 14:00). So 13:30-14:00: All are free? Let me check each person:\n\n- Judy: 13:30-14:00 is free (she's busy 13-13:30 and 16-16:30)\n- Olivia: 13:30-14:00 is free (her last busy was 14:00-14:30)\nWait, Olivia's busy times are 10-10:30, 12-13, 14:00-14:30. So 13:30-14:00, she's free. \n- Eric: free.\n- Jacqueline: free after 10:30 and 15:00-15:30. So 13:30-14:00 is free.\n- Laura: her busy times are up to 13:30, then next is 14:30-15:00. So 13:30-14:30 she's free? Wait, Laura's schedule: 9-10, 10:30-12, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00. So between 13:30 and 14:30, she's free.\n- Tyler: busy at 14:00-14:30, so 13:30-14:00 he's free.\n- Lisa: after 13:30, her next busy is 14:00-14:30. So 13:30-14:00 she's free.\n\nSo 13:30-14:00 seems possible. Wait, but wait, the meeting is half an hour. So from 13:30 to 14:00, that's 30 minutes. All participants are free. Let me confirm each person:\n\nJudy: free (busy 13-13:30, next at 16-16:30)\nOlivia: free (busy until 13:00, next at 14-14:30)\nEric: free\nJacqueline: free\nLaura: free until 14:30\nTyler: free until 14:00\nLisa: free until 14:00\n\nWait, Lisa's next busy is 14:00-14:30. So if the meeting is at 13:30-14:00, Lisa is free. Tyler is free until 14:00. So yes. This slot seems to work. Let me check again.\n\nBut wait, let's check every participant's schedule:\n\nJudy: No conflicts 13:30-14:00. Correct.\n\nOlivia: Her blocked times are 10-10:30, 12-13, 14-14:30. So 13:30-14:00 is free.\n\nEric: Free.\n\nJacqueline: Her meetings are 10-10:30 and 15-15:30. So 13:30-14:00 is free.\n\nLaura: She's busy at 13-13:30, then free until 14:30. So yes, 13:30-14:00 is free.\n\nTyler: His blocked times are 9-10, 11-11:30, 12:30-13, 14-14:30, 15:30-17. So 13:30-14:00 is free.\n\nLisa: Her blocked times include 13-13:30 and 14-14:30. So 13:30-14:00 is between those; she's free here.\n\nYes, this works! So the meeting can be scheduled from 13:30 to 14:00 on Monday.",
