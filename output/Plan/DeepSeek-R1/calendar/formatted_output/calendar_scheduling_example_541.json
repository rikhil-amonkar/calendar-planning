            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for Kayla and Rebecca on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The meeting should be one hour long. Let me look at their schedules first.\n\nKayla has blocked times: 10:00-10:30 and 14:30-16:00. So her available slots are 9:00-10:00, 10:30-14:30, and then 16:00-17:00. Wait, but 14:30 to 16:00 is blocked, so after 16:00 she's free until 17:00.\n\nRebecca's blocked times are 9:00-13:00, 13:30-15:00, and 15:30-16:00. So her available slots are 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-17:00. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.\n\nLet me list out the available times for each and find the overlap. \n\nKayla's available:\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 10:30-14:30\n- 16:00-17:00\n\nRebecca's available:\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 15:00-15:30\n- 16:00-17:00\n\nNow, overlapping times. Let's check each slot.\n\nFirst, 9:00-10:00: Rebecca is busy until 13:00, so no overlap here.\n\nNext, Kayla's 10:30-14:30. Rebecca's first available is 13:00-13:30. So overlapping here would be 13:00-13:30. But Kayla is available until 14:30. So 13:00-13:30 is a possible slot. That's 30 minutes, but the meeting needs an hour. So that's not enough.\n\nThen, Rebecca's next slot is 15:00-15:30. Kayla's available during that time? Kayla is blocked from 14:30 to 16:00. So 15:00-15:30 is within Kayla's blocked time. So Rebecca is available here, but Kayla isn't. So that's not possible.\n\nNext, Rebecca's 16:00-17:00. Kayla is available from 16:00 onwards. So both are free from 16:00 to 17:00. That's a one-hour slot. Perfect. So the meeting can be scheduled from 16:00 to 17:00 on Monday. That works for both.",
