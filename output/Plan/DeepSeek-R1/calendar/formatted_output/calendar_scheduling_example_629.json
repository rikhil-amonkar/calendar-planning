            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot for Margaret and Alexis either on Monday or Tuesday between 9:00 and 17:00. But there are some constraints. Margaret doesn't want to meet on Monday, so that leaves only Tuesday. Also, she doesn't want to meet before 14:30 on Tuesday. Let me check their schedules.\n\nFirst, let's look at Tuesday. Margaret's schedule on Tuesday has a block from 12:00 to 12:30. Alexis on Tuesday has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, and 14:00 to 16:30. So Alexis is busy until 16:30. The available time for Alexis after 16:30 is from 16:30 to 17:00. But Margaret's availability on Tuesday after 14:30. Since Margaret's only block on Tuesday is 12:00-12:30, her available time on Tuesday after 14:30 is from 14:30 onwards, except maybe if there's something else. Wait, the problem states that Margaret's existing schedule on Tuesday is only the 12:00 to 12:30 block. So from 9:00 to 17:00, except that 30 minutes, but she also prefers not to meet before 14:30. So her available time on Tuesday is 14:30 to 17:00, except any other blocks. Wait, let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nMargaret's existing schedule: On Tuesday, she has a block from 12:00 to 12:30. That's all. So her available times on Tuesday are 9:00-12:00, 12:30-17:00. But she doesn't want to meet before 14:30 on Tuesday. So her available time on Tuesday is 14:30 to 17:00. Alexis on Tuesday is busy until 16:30. So Alexis is free from 16:30 to 17:00. But that's only 30 minutes, which is exactly the meeting duration. So the possible slot is Tuesday 16:30-17:00. Let's check if that works for both. Margaret is available from 14:30 onwards, and her schedule on Tuesday doesn't block that time. Alexis is free after 16:30. So 16:30 to 17:00 is a 30-minute slot. That should work. There's no overlap with their existing meetings. So the answer should be Tuesday at 16:30-17:00.",
