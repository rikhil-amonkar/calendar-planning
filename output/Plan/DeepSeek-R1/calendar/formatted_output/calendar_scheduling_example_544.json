            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting between Deborah and Albert for half an hour on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Deborah is free all day, so her schedule isn't a problem. The main constraints come from Albert's schedule and his availability.\n\nFirst, let's list out Albert's blocked times on Monday. He has three blocks: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, and 15:00-16:30. Additionally, he can't meet after 11:00 on Monday. Wait, that seems a bit conflicting with his blocked times. Let me parse this carefully.\n\nAlbert's blocked times are 9-10, 10:30-12, and 15-16:30. But there's also a note that he can't meet after 11:00. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So his blocked times include 10:30-12:00, which is after 10:30. But the note says he can't meet after 11:00. Maybe that's an additional constraint. So even if there's a gap, after 11:00 he can't meet. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"Albert can not meet on Monday after 11:00.\" So regardless of his blocked calendar times, he's unavailable after 11:00. That's a key point. So even if his calendar shows some free time after 11, he can't meet. So his availability is before 11:00.\n\nBut looking at his blocked times: 9-10, 10:30-12, 15-16:30. So before 11:00, his blocked times are 9-10 and 10:30-12. Wait, but 10:30-12 is after 10:30. So between 10:00 and 10:30, he's free? But he can't meet after 11:00. So the latest they can start the meeting is at 10:30, because the meeting is 30 minutes, ending at 11:00. But Albert's blocked from 10:30-12:00. Oh, wait, but the constraint is he can't meet after 11:00. So even if the meeting starts at 10:30, it would end at 11:00. But Albert's calendar is blocked from 10:30-12:00, which includes that time. So that time is already blocked. Hmm, maybe there's a conflict here.\n\nWait, the problem says there exists a solution. Let me re-examine the constraints. Albert's blocked times on Monday are 9-10, 10:30-12, and 15-16:30. He can't meet after 11:00. So his available time is before 11:00, but considering his blocked calendar. So before 11:00, he has the following free periods: from 10:00 to 10:30, because he's blocked until 10:00, then free until 10:30, then blocked again from 10:30. But wait, his first block is 9-10, so after 10:00 he's free until 10:30, then blocked from 10:30-12. So the available slots for Albert before 11:00 would be 10:00 to 10:30. Because after 10:30, he's blocked, and he can't meet after 11:00 anyway. So the only possible slot is 10:00-10:30. Because the meeting needs to be 30 minutes. Let's check that. If the meeting is from 10:00 to 10:30, that's 30 minutes. Deborah is free all day, so that works. Albert isn't blocked during that time (his first block ends at 10:00). Wait, the block is 9-10:00, so at 10:00 he's free. So 10:00-10:30 is available. Then, the next block starts at 10:30, but the meeting ends at 10:30. That works. Also, since he can't meet after 11:00, but the meeting ends at 10:30, which is before 11:00. So that should be acceptable. Therefore, the proposed time is Monday from 10:00 to 10:30.",
