            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for seven people: Megan, Christine, Gabriel, Sara, Bruce, Kathryn, and Billy. The meeting is half an hour long and has to be between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Let's go through each person's schedule step by step.\n\nStarting with Megan. She's busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, and 12:00-12:30. So her available times are before 9, but since work hours start at 9, maybe after 9:30. Wait, her first free slot is 9:30-10:00. Then from 11:00 to 12:00, but wait, she has 10-11 busy. Then 12:30 onwards? But she might have other meetings. Wait, let me list her busy times again:\n\nMegan's busy periods:\n9:00-9:30\n10:00-11:00\n12:00-12:30\n\nSo her available slots on Monday would be:\n9:30-10:00 (30 min)\n11:00-12:00 (1 hour)\n12:30-17:00 (but need to check others)\n\nNext, Christine. Her meetings are:\n9:00-9:30\n11:30-12:00\n13:00-14:00\n15:30-16:30\n\nSo Christine's available times are:\nAfter 9:30-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 14:00-15:30, and after 16:30. But the meeting has to end by 17:00, so 16:30-17:00 is possible for her.\n\nGabriel is free all day, so no problem there.\n\nSara's meetings:\n11:30-12:00\n14:30-15:00\n\nSo Sara's available times are before 11:30, 12:00-14:30, 15:00-17:00.\n\nBruce's schedule is pretty packed. His busy times:\n9:30-10:00\n10:30-12:00\n12:30-14:00\n14:30-15:00\n15:30-16:30\n\nSo Bruce's available slots are:\n9:00-9:30 (but Megan is busy then)\nWait, Bruce is busy 9:30-10:00. So before 9:30 he's free? Wait, the work hours start at 9:00, so his first available time is 9:00-9:30, but Megan is busy then. Then after 10:00-10:30? Wait, Bruce is busy from 10:30 to 12:00. So between 10:00 and 10:30? Let me check:\n\nWait, Bruce's schedule: 9:30-10:00 (busy), then 10:30-12:00. So between 10:00 and 10:30, he's free. Then from 12:00-12:30, maybe? But Bruce is busy from 12:30 to 14:00. So after 14:00 to 14:30? But he's busy again at 14:30-15:00. Then from 15:00-15:30? But he's busy again at 15:30-16:30. So Bruce's available times are:\n\n9:00-9:30 (but Megan is busy then)\n10:00-10:30\n12:00-12:30 (but Megan is busy until 12:30)\n14:00-14:30\n15:00-15:30\n16:30-17:00\n\nKathryn's busy times are 10:00-15:30 and 16:00-16:30. So she's available from 9:00-10:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nBilly's schedule:\n9:00-9:30\n11:00-11:30\n12:00-14:00\n14:30-15:30\n\nSo Billy is free from 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-17:00.\n\nNow, we need a 30-minute slot where all seven are available.\n\nLet's look for overlapping times.\n\nFirst, check the earliest possible time. Let's see:\n\nLooking at Kathryn's availability: she's only available 9-10, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17. Since her availability is limited, maybe that's the key.\n\nSo possible slots are 9-10, 15:30-16, 16:30-17.\n\nCheck 9:00-9:30: Megan is busy here. So that's out.\n\n9:30-10:00: Megan is free here (she's busy 10-11). Let's check others:\n\nChristine: 9:30-11:30 is available except for 11:30. So 9:30-10:00, Christine is free. Gabriel is free. Sara is free (before 11:30). Bruce: from 10:00-10:30 he's free, but 9:30-10:00 he's busy. Wait Bruce's busy from 9:30-10:00. So Bruce is busy during 9:30-10:00. So that slot is not possible.\n\nNext slot: 15:30-16:00. Let's check:\n\nKathryn is available here. Christine is busy until 16:30. Christine has a meeting from 15:30-16:30. So she's not available during 15:30-16:00. So that's out.\n\nNext possible slot: 16:30-17:00. Kathryn is available here (16:30-17). Christine's last meeting ends at 16:30, so 16:30-17 she's free. Let's check everyone:\n\nMegan: available after 12:30, so 16:30 is fine.\nChristine: 16:30-17 free.\nGabriel: yes.\nSara: available after 15:00, so 16:30 is okay.\nBruce: 16:30-17 is free (he's busy until 16:30).\nKathryn: 16:30-17 free.\nBilly: available from 15:30-17:00, so 16:30 is okay.\n\nSo 16:30-17:00 is 30 minutes. Wait, the meeting is half an hour. So 16:30-17:00 is 30 minutes. Does that work?\n\nCheck each person:\n\nMegan: No conflicts. Her last meeting is 12:00-12:30, so after that she's free.\nChristine: After 16:30, yes.\nGabriel: Yes.\nSara: Yes.\nBruce: After 16:30, yes.\nKathryn: 16:30-17 is free.\nBilly: Yes, he's free after 15:30 except 14:30-15:30. So 16:30 is good.\n\nSo that's a possible slot. Let me check if there's any other time.\n\nAnother possible time might be 15:00-15:30. Let's see:\n\nKathryn is busy until 15:30. So she can't attend before 15:30. So that's out.\n\nWhat about 14:00-14:30? Let's check:\n\nKathryn is busy until 15:30. So she can't be there. So that's no.\n\nAnother possibility: 12:00-12:30? Let's see:\n\nMegan is busy 12:00-12:30. So she can't. So no.\n\nWhat about 12:30-13:00? Megan is free after 12:30. Christine is free from 12:00-13:00 (since her next meeting is 13:00-14:00). So 12:30-13:00.\n\nCheck others:\n\nSara: 11:30-12:00 busy, then free. So 12:30 is okay.\n\nBruce: He's busy from 12:30-14:00. So 12:30-13:00 is busy. So Bruce can't attend. So that's out.\n\nAnother possible slot: 14:00-14:30. Let's check:\n\nKathryn is still busy until 15:30. So she can't. So no.\n\nWhat about 15:00-15:30? Kathryn is busy, so no.\n\nAnother slot: 16:00-16:30. Wait, Christine is busy until 16:30. So 16:00-16:30 would have Christine in a meeting. So that's out.\n\nSo the only possible slot is 16:30-17:00. Let me double-check everyone's availability at that time:\n\nMegan: Free.\nChristine: Free after 16:30.\nGabriel: Free.\nSara: Free.\nBruce: His last meeting ends at 16:30, so free after.\nKathryn: Free from 16:30-17.\nBilly: Free after 15:30.\n\nYes, that works. So the proposed time is Monday 16:30-17:00.",
