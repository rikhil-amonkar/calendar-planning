            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday for Bobby and Michael. The key is to find the earliest available time where both are free.\n\nFirst, let's break down Bobby's schedule. On Monday, he's busy from 14:30 to 15:00. So, his available times on Monday would be 9:00-14:30 and 15:00-17:00. But wait, the meeting has to be half an hour, so the latest start time on Monday would be 16:30. On Tuesday, Bobby has several busy periods: 9:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-15:00, and 15:30-17:00. His available slots on Tuesday would be the gaps between these. Let's see: 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, and 15:00-15:30. Wait, but 15:00-15:30 is available, but then he's busy again until 17:00. So possible Tuesday slots are those three gaps.\n\nNow Michael's schedule. On Monday, he's busy 9:00-10:00, 10:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, and 15:30-17:00. His available times on Monday would be 10:00-10:30, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30. Then on Tuesday, his busy times are 9:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-14:00, 15:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. So available on Tuesday would be 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 14:00-15:00, 16:00-16:30.\n\nOur goal is to find overlapping free times between Bobby and Michael on either day, starting with the earliest possible.\n\nStarting with Monday. Let's list their free slots:\n\nBobby's Monday free: 9:00-14:30 and 15:00-17:00. But since Michael's Monday free slots are 10:00-10:30, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30. So overlapping times would be:\n\n- 10:00-10:30 (Bobby is free here, Michael is free)\n- 13:30-14:00 (Bobby free until 14:30, Michael free 13:30-14:00)\n- 15:00-15:30 (Bobby's available from 15:00, but Michael is only free until 15:30, but Bobby can do 15:00-17:00. So 15:00-15:30 is possible here.)\n\nNow check the earliest on Monday. The earliest overlapping slot is 10:00-10:30. Let's see if that works. But wait, Bobby is free from 9:00-14:30 on Monday. Michael is busy until 10:00, so his first available is 10:00-10:30. So a 30-minute meeting here would be 10:00-10:30. Is that possible? Yes, because both are free during that time.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm. Bobby's Monday busy time is 14:30-15:00. So before that, he's free. Michael's Monday busy times end at 10:00, so 10:00-10:30 is free for both. So that's a possible slot on Monday at 10:00-10:30.\n\nNow check Tuesday. Let's see Bobby's free times: 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 15:00-15:30. Michael's Tuesday free times: 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 14:00-15:00, 16:00-16:30.\n\nLooking for overlaps:\n\n- 11:30-12:00: Both are free here. Bobby is free from 11:30-12:00, Michael is free 11:30-12:00. So that's a 30-minute slot.\n\nBut comparing the earliest possible times: Monday's 10:00 is earlier than Tuesday's 11:30. So the earliest possible would be Monday at 10:00. But wait, the problem says \"the group would like to meet at their earliest availability.\" So the first available slot is Monday 10:00-10:30.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's list all possible slots in order.\n\nMonday options:\n\n1. 10:00-10:30\n2. 13:30-14:00\n3. 15:00-15:30\n\nTuesday options:\n\n1. 11:30-12:00\n2. 14:00-15:00 (but Bobby is only free from 15:00 on Tuesday, so that's not overlapping. Wait, Michael's free 14:00-15:00 on Tuesday, but Bobby is busy until 15:00. So Bobby's available from 15:00-15:30. So the overlap here is 15:00-15:30, but Michael is free until 15:00? Wait, no. Michael on Tuesday is busy 12:00-14:00, then free until 15:00. So from 14:00-15:00, Michael is free. Bobby on Tuesday is busy until 15:00. So Bobby is free 15:00-15:30. So the overlap here would be 15:00-15:00? No, that's a point. So no overlap in that time. So the only Tuesday overlaps are 11:30-12:00 and 15:00-15:30 (if Michael is free). Wait, Michael on Tuesday is free 14:00-15:00, then busy 15:00-16:00. So at 15:00, Michael becomes busy. So Bobby is free 15:00-15:30, but Michael is busy from 15:00 onwards. So that's not overlapping. So the only Tuesday slot is 11:30-12:00.\n\nSo between Monday's 10:00-10:30 and Tuesday's 11:30-12:00, the earliest is Monday at 10:00. But wait, let's check again. Is there any earlier slot?\n\nWait, Bobby is free on Monday from 9:00-14:30. Michael is busy until 10:00 on Monday. So the first available time for both is 10:00-10:30. That's correct.\n\nBut let me check the schedules again to make sure.\n\nBobby's Monday busy: 14:30-15:00. So before 14:30, he's free except that. Michael's Monday busy: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00. So after 10:00, Michael is free from 10:00-10:30. So 10:00-10:30 is available. That's the earliest possible time. So the answer should be Monday 10:00-10:30.",
