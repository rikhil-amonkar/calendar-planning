First, I need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Patrick, Kayla, Carl, and Christian. Let's break down each person's busy times and look for overlaps where everyone is free.\n\nStarting with Patrick's schedule:\n- Busy at 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 13:30-14:00, 16:00-16:30.\nSo his free times are:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:30-13:30 (but wait, he's busy again at 13:30-14:00)\nWait, no. Let's list all possible free intervals:\nFrom 9:00-17:00, subtract his busy times. So:\n- 9:30-10:00 (free)\n- 10:30-13:30 (free until 13:30)\n- 14:00-16:00 (free from 14:00 to 16:00)\n- 16:30-17:00 (free)\n\nKayla's schedule:\n- Busy at 12:30-13:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\nFree times:\n- 9:00-12:30\n- 13:30-15:00\n- 15:30-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nCarl's blocked times:\n- 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-17:00.\nSo his free slots are:\n- 9:00-10:30\n- 11:00-12:00\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 13:30-14:30\n\nChristian's schedule:\n- 9:00-12:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-17:00.\nFree times:\n- 12:30-13:00 (only 30 minutes)\n- 14:00-14:30 (another 30 minutes)\n\nNow, let's find overlapping free times for all four.\n\nLooking at Christian's free slots first since they're the most limited. He only has 12:30-13:00 and 14:00-14:30.\n\nCheck 12:30-13:00:\n- Christian is free.\n- Patrick: 10:30-13:30. At 12:30-13:00, Patrick is free.\n- Kayla: Busy until 12:30, then free until 13:30. Wait, her busy time is 12:30-13:30. So during 12:30-13:00, Kayla is busy. So this slot won't work.\n\nNext, Christian's 14:00-14:30:\nCheck others:\n- Patrick is free from 14:00-16:00 (since his busy time ends at 14:00). So 14:00-14:30 is okay.\n- Kayla: She's free from 13:30-15:00. So 14:00-14:30 is free.\n- Carl: His free time is 13:30-14:30. So 14:00-14:30 is within that. Good.\n- Christian: Free here.\n\nSo this slot 14:00-14:30 works for everyone. Let's confirm each person's availability:\n\nPatrick: No conflicts here; he's busy at 13:30-14:00, so 14:00 onwards is free.\nKayla: Free from 13:30-15:00.\nCarl: Free until 14:30.\nChristian: Free 14:00-14:30.\n\nYes, 14:00-14:30 is a 30-minute window where all are available. That should be the answer.",
