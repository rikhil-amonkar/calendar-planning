            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for Stephanie, Cheryl, Bradley, and Steven on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The meeting should be one hour long. Let's look at each person's schedule and find a time when all are free.\n\nStarting with Stephanie's busy times: 10:00-10:30 and 16:00-16:30. So she's free outside those slots. Cheryl has meetings at 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:30-14:00, and 16:30-17:00. Bradley's busy periods are 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00. Steven's blocked times are 9:00-12:00, 13:00-13:30, and 14:30-17:00.\n\nLet me list the available time slots for each person and find the overlap.\n\nFirst, the work hours are 9:00 to 17:00. So possible slots are from 9:00 to 17:00, but considering each person's availability.\n\nLooking at the morning first. From 9:00 to 9:30: Stephanie is free. Cheryl is free (her first meeting at 10:00). Bradley has a meeting from 9:30-10:00, so before 9:30 he's free? Wait, his first meeting is 9:30-10:00, so from 9:00 to 9:30 he's free. Steven is blocked until 12:00, so he can't meet before 12:00. So the morning is out because Steven is unavailable until noon.\n\nSo possible times are after 12:00. Let's check after 12:00.\n\nSteven's available from 12:00 to 13:00? Wait, his blocked times are 9:00-12:00, so he's free from 12:00 onwards, except 13:00-13:30 and 14:30-17:00. So between 12:00 to 13:00, he's free. Then from 13:30 to 14:30 he's free (since 13:00-13:30 is blocked, and 14:30 onwards is blocked). Wait, Steven's blocked 14:30 to 17:00, so his available after 12 is 12:00-13:00 and 13:30-14:30.\n\nCheryl's afternoon meetings: 13:30-14:00 and 16:30-17:00. So after 12:00, she's busy 13:30-14:00 and 16:30-17:00. So she's free from 12:00 to 13:30, then from 14:00 to 16:30.\n\nBradley's schedule after 12:00: he has 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00. So between 12:00 to 13:30 he's free (assuming his previous meeting was 10:30-11:30, then 11:30 to 12:00 he's free?), then from 12:00-13:30, except he might have lunch or something? Wait, the problem states their existing schedules. Bradley's meetings are at 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00. So after 12:00, he's free from 12:00 to 13:30, then 14:00-14:30 (since his next meeting is 14:30), and 15:00-15:30.\n\nStephanie's afternoon busy times are 16:00-16:30. So she's free from 12:00 to 16:00 except her 16:00-16:30 slot. Wait, her schedule says 10:00-10:30 and 16:00-16:30. So from 12:00 to 16:00 she's free except maybe lunch? But according to the given data, she's only busy at 10-10:30 and 16-16:30. So available from 9:00-10:00, 10:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. But since we're looking after 12:00, she's available from 12:00-16:00 and 16:30-17:00.\n\nNow, let's look for overlaps:\n\nSteven is available from 12:00-13:00 and 13:30-14:30.\n\nCheryl is available 12:00-13:30, 14:00-16:30.\n\nBradley is available 12:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30.\n\nStephanie is available 12:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo overlapping times:\n\nFirst slot: 12:00-13:00 (Steven's available here). But Cheryl is available until 13:30. Bradley is available until 13:30. So 12:00-13:00 is possible. But Steven is available until 13:00? Wait, Steven's blocked until 12:00, then free from 12:00 to 13:00 (since his next block is 13:00-13:30). So Steven is available from 12:00-13:00. Then he's blocked from 13:00-13:30. So the first possible slot is 12:00-13:00. Let's check:\n\nStephanie is free here. Cheryl is free. Bradley is free. Steven is free. So that's a one-hour slot from 12:00-13:00. But wait, the meeting needs to be one hour. 12:00 to 13:00 is exactly one hour, which works.\n\nBut wait, Steven's available until 13:00? Because he's blocked from 13:00-13:30. So 12:00-13:00 is okay. Let's check other people. Cheryl's next meeting is at 13:30, so she's free until then. Bradley is free until 13:30. Stephanie is free. So that slot works.\n\nBut wait, another possible slot: After 13:30. Let's see. Steven is available from 13:30-14:30. Cheryl is available from 14:00-16:30. So from 14:00-14:30. Let's check that.\n\nFrom 14:00-15:00? Wait, the meeting needs to be one hour. Let's check:\n\nIf we look at 14:00-15:00, but Bradley has a meeting from 14:30-15:00. So he's free from 14:00-14:30. So a meeting from 14:00-15:00 would conflict with Bradley's 14:30 meeting. So that's not possible. So the maximum we can do here is 14:00-14:30, but that's only 30 minutes. Not enough.\n\nAnother possible time: 15:00-16:00. Let's check:\n\nBradley is free from 15:00-15:30. So 15:00-16:00 would require him to be free until 16:00, but he's only free until 15:30. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother option: 13:30-14:30. Steven is free here. But Cheryl has a meeting at 13:30-14:00, so she's busy until 14:00. So from 14:00-14:30, Cheryl is free, Bradley is free until 14:30, Steven is free until 14:30. Stephanie is free. So 14:00-15:00 would conflict with Bradley's 14:30-15:00 meeting. So 14:00-14:30 is only 30 minutes. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, 15:00-15:30 for Bradley. But Steven is blocked from 14:30-17:00. Wait, no: Steven is blocked from 14:30 to 17:00. So after 14:30, Steven is not available. So any time after 14:30 for Steven is blocked. So the only possible slots are 12:00-13:00 and 13:30-14:30 (but Steven is available here from 13:30-14:30). Let's check 13:30-14:30 for others:\n\nCheryl has a meeting 13:30-14:00. So she's busy until 14:00. So from 14:00-14:30, Cheryl is free. Bradley is free from 14:00-14:30. Stephanie is free. Steven is available until 14:30. So a meeting from 14:00-15:00 is not possible because Bradley has a meeting at 14:30. So the only possible slot here is 14:00-14:30, but that's 30 minutes. Not enough.\n\nSo the only possible full hour where all are available is 12:00-13:00. Let's confirm:\n\nStephanie: 10:00-10:30 and 16:00-16:30. So 12-1pm is free.\n\nCheryl: her meetings are 10-10:30, 11:30-12, 1:30-2pm, etc. So from 12:00-1:30pm she's free except 11:30-12:00. Wait, Cheryl has 11:30-12:00 as a meeting. So 12:00-13:30 she's free. So 12:00-1pm is within her free time.\n\nBradley: after 12:00, he's free until 1:30pm. So 12-1pm is okay.\n\nSteven: his blocked times are 9am-12pm. So after 12pm, he's free until 1pm (since his next block is 1-1:30pm). So 12-1pm works for him.\n\nYes, that's the only slot where all four are available.",
