            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Tyler, Kelly, Stephanie, Hannah, Joe, Diana, and Deborah. Let's start by listing everyone's blocked times and then look for gaps where all are free.\n\nFirst, let's note down each person's schedule:\n\n- **Tyler**: Free all day. No issues here.\n- **Kelly**: Also free all day. So, no conflicts from them.\n- **Stephanie**: Busy 11:00-11:30 and 14:30-15:00.\n- **Hannah**: Free all day.\n- **Joe**: Blocked 9:00-9:30, 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-17:00. So Joe is only free from 9:30-10:00, 12:00-12:30, and 13:00-14:00.\n- **Diana**: Meetings 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00. So her free times are 10:30-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00.\n- **Deborah**: Busy 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-16:30. Her free slots are 10:00-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nNow, let's combine these. Since Tyler, Kelly, and Hannah are free all day, the main constraints come from Stephanie, Joe, Diana, and Deborah.\n\nLooking at Joe's free times first because he's the most restricted. His available slots are:\n\n1. 9:30-10:00\n2. 12:00-12:30\n3. 13:00-14:00\n\nLet's check each of these against the others.\n\n**First slot: 9:30-10:00**\n\nCheck Diana's availability: She's busy until 10:30. So this slot is out because Diana isn't free here.\n\n**Second slot: 12:00-12:30**\n\nCheck others:\n\n- Stephanie is free (her blocked time is 11-11:30 and 14:30-15:00).\n- Deborah is free from 12:00-12:30 (she's busy 10:30-12:00, so 12:00 is the end of her busy time? Wait, Deborah's blocked until 12:00, so from 12:00 onwards she's free until 12:30? Let me check again: Deborah's schedule says busy 10:30-12:00. So at 12:00, she's free. So 12:00-12:30 is free for her. \n\nDiana's schedule: She has a meeting 11:30-12:00, so after 12:00, she's free until 13:00. So Diana is free 12:00-13:00. \n\nJoe is free 12:00-12:30. So this slot is 12:00-12:30. But the meeting needs to be 30 minutes. So 12:00-12:30 would work. Let's confirm others:\n\nStephanie: She's free during 12:00-12:30. Yes, her blocked times are 11-11:30 and 14:30-15:00. \n\nDeborah: 12:00-12:30 is free. \n\nDiana: Free. \n\nJoe: Free. \n\nOthers (Tyler, Kelly, Hannah) are all free. So this seems like a possible slot. But wait, Joe's available until 12:30, so the meeting can be from 12:00-12:30. That's 30 minutes. Let me check if all are free here.\n\nYes. So this might be a candidate. But let's check other possible slots in case.\n\n**Third slot: 13:00-14:00 (Joe's available here)**\n\nCheck others:\n\n- Diana is busy 13:00-14:00. So Diana can't make it. So this slot is out.\n\nSo the only possible slots from Joe's availability are 12:00-12:30 and 9:30-10:00. The 9:30-10:00 is blocked by Diana. So 12:00-12:30 is the only candidate from Joe's slots.\n\nWait, but let's check other possible times that might not be in Joe's available slots but maybe overlap. Wait, Joe is only available in those three slots. So if we can't use those, there's no other time. So 12:00-12:30 seems to work.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's any other possible time outside Joe's slots. For example, after 14:00. But Joe is blocked from 14:00-17:00, so that's out.\n\nWhat about 14:00-14:30? Let's see. Joe is busy, so no. So the only possible time is 12:00-12:30.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Let's make sure that all participants are free during 12:00-12:30.\n\n- Tyler: Yes\n- Kelly: Yes\n- Stephanie: She has no meetings then. Her blocked times are 11-11:30 and 14:30-15:00. So 12:00-12:30 is free.\n- Hannah: Yes\n- Joe: Free 12:00-12:30\n- Diana: Free 12:00-13:00. So yes.\n- Deborah: Free 12:00-12:30 (since her blocked time ends at 12:00). Yes.\n\nSo all are available. That seems like a valid slot. Are there any other possible times?\n\nLet's check other possible gaps. For example, between 10:30-11:00.\n\nBut Joe is busy from 10:00-12:00, so that's out. \n\nWhat about 15:30-16:00? Let's check:\n\n- Joe is busy (blocked 14:00-17:00)\nSo Joe can't attend. So no.\n\nAnother time: 14:00-14:30. Joe is busy. So no.\n\nSo the only possible time is 12:00-12:30. That works for everyone.",
