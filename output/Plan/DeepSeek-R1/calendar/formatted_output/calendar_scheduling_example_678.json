            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. So, Russell and Alexander need a one-hour meeting between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday or Tuesday. Let me check their schedules and constraints.\n\nFirst, let's look at Monday. Russell is busy from 10:30 to 11:00. Alexander's schedule on Monday is packed: he has meetings from 9:00-11:30, 12:00-14:30, and 15:00-17:00. So, the available slots on Monday for Alexander would be the gaps between his meetings. Let's see:\n\nBetween 11:30 and 12:00, there's a 30-minute gap. That's not enough for a one-hour meeting. Then, between 14:30 and 15:00, another 30-minute gap. Also not enough. So on Monday, Alexander only has those two 30-minute breaks, which don't work. Russell's available on Monday except 10:30-11:00, but since Alexander's first free time is 11:30-12:00, but that's only 30 minutes. So Monday doesn't seem possible.\n\nNow, let's check Tuesday. Russell prefers not to meet before 13:30. So we need to look at times from 13:30 onwards. Let's see their schedules on Tuesday.\n\nRussell is busy from 13:00 to 13:30. Wait, the problem says Russell is busy on Tuesday during 13:00-13:30. But he'd rather not meet before 13:30. So after 13:30 is preferred. Alexander's Tuesday schedule: meetings at 9:00-10:00, 13:00-14:00, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-16:30. So his available times on Tuesday are between 10:00-13:00, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. But Russell's preference is after 13:30, so let's focus on times from 13:30 onwards.\n\nSo possible slots after 13:30 on Tuesday:\n\nAlexander's available from 14:00-15:00. Russell is free then because his only conflict on Tuesday is 13:00-13:30. So 14:00-15:00 is a possible slot. Let me check if there's an hour there. From 14:00 to 15:00, that's a full hour. Both are free. Russell's available after 13:30, so 14:00-15:00 works. Also, Alexander is free from 14:00-15:00. So that's a valid slot. \n\nAnother possible slot is 15:30-16:00 (30 minutes) and 16:30-17:00 (30 minutes), but those are only half-hour each. So the only full hour available on Tuesday is 14:00-15:00. That fits both schedules and meets Russell's preference of not meeting before 13:30. So the answer should be Tuesday from 14:00 to 15:00.",
