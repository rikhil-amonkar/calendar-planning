            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, the goal is to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 where Jacob, Diana, Adam, Angela, and Dennis are all available. Let me go through each person's schedule step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out everyone's busy times:\n\nJacob:\n- 13:30\u201314:00\n- 14:30\u201315:00\n\nDiana:\n- 9:30\u201310:00\n- 11:30\u201312:00\n- 13:00\u201313:30\n- 16:00\u201316:30\n\nAdam:\n- 9:30\u201310:30\n- 11:00\u201312:30\n- 15:30\u201316:00\n\nAngela:\n- 9:30\u201310:00\n- 10:30\u201312:00\n- 13:00\u201315:30\n- 16:00\u201316:30\n\nDennis:\n- 9:00\u20139:30\n- 10:30\u201311:30\n- 13:00\u201315:00\n- 16:30\u201317:00\n\nNow, let's look for gaps where none of these blocks overlap. The meeting needs to be 30 minutes, so I need a half-hour window where all are free.\n\nStarting from 9:00. Dennis is busy until 9:30. Then, at 9:30, Jacob, Diana, Adam, and Angela have overlapping meetings until 10:00. So 9:00-9:30 is out (Dennis), 9:30-10:00 is out (Jacob, Diana, Adam, Angela). \n\nNext, 10:00-10:30: Let's check. Angela is free here (her next meeting is 10:30). Adam is free after 10:30? Wait, Adam's first meeting is 9:30-10:30. So until 10:30, he's busy. So from 10:00 to 10:30, Adam is still in a meeting until 10:30. So 10:00-10:30 is not possible for Adam. Then, 10:30-11:00? Angela is busy until 12:00, Dennis is in a meeting from 10:30-11:30. So that's out.\n\n11:00-11:30: Adam is in a meeting (11:00-12:30), Diana has 11:30-12:00, but even before that, Angela is busy until 12:00. Dennis is busy until 11:30. So this time is blocked.\n\n12:00-12:30: Adam is still in a meeting until 12:30. Angela is free after 12:00, but Diana has 11:30-12:00. So from 12:00-12:30, Adam is busy until 12:30. So maybe 12:30-13:00? Let's check.\n\n12:30-13:00: Jacob is free. Diana's next meeting starts at 13:00. Adam is free after 12:30. Angela is free until 13:00. Dennis is free until 13:00. So this seems possible. Wait, Dennis has 13:00-15:00. So 12:30-13:00 is free for him. Diana's last meeting before that was 11:30-12:00, so 12:00-13:00 she's free except 12:00-12:30? Wait, Diana's schedule says 11:30-12:00, then 13:00-13:30. So from 12:00 to 13:00, she's free except maybe 12:00-12:30? Wait, no. Let me recheck. Diana has 11:30-12:00, then next is 13:00-13:30. So between 12:00 and 13:00, she's free. So 12:30-13:00 would work for her. \n\nSo, 12:30-13:00. Let's confirm all participants:\n\nJacob: No conflicts. His first meeting is at 13:30.\nDiana: Free until 13:00.\nAdam: Free after 12:30.\nAngela: Free after 12:00 until 13:00.\nDennis: Free from 12:30 to 13:00.\n\nYes, this slot works. Wait, but Dennis is available from 12:30 to 13:00. Because his next meeting starts at 13:00. So 12:30-13:00 is okay. All others are free here. So that's a possible slot.\n\nAlternatively, check after 15:00. Let's see:\n\nAfter Angela's 13:00-15:30, so she's free from 15:30 onwards. But Adam has 15:30-16:00. Jacob has 14:30-15:00. Dennis is busy until 15:00 (13:00-15:00). So after 15:00, Dennis is free until 16:30. Jacob's next meeting is 14:30-15:00, so after 15:00 he's free. Diana is free after 16:00 except 16:00-16:30. Adam is busy 15:30-16:00. Angela is free from 15:30 to 16:00. So between 15:00 and 15:30: Jacob is free, Diana is free (she's next busy at 16:00), Adam is free until 15:30, Angela is free from 15:30, so 15:00-15:30: Angela's busy until 15:30. So 15:00-15:30: Angela is still in a meeting until 15:30. So that's not possible. So 15:30-16:00: Adam and Angela have meetings. Diana is free until 16:00. Dennis is free until 16:30. So 16:00-16:30: Diana and Angela are busy. So that's out. Then 16:30-17:00: Dennis is busy. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother possible slot could be 16:00-16:30, but Diana and Angela are busy then. So no. \n\nAnother check: between 12:30-13:00. All are free. Let me confirm each person:\n\nJacob: No meetings in this time. His first is 13:30.\nDiana: Free from 12:00 to 13:00. So yes.\nAdam: His last meeting ends at 12:30. So 12:30-13:00 is free.\nAngela: Her schedule is busy until 12:00, then free until 13:00.\nDennis: His meetings are until 13:00. So 12:30-13:00 is free.\n\nYes, all are available here. So the slot would be 12:30 to 13:00 on Monday.",
