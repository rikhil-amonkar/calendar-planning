            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Christine, Janice, Bobby, Elizabeth, Tyler, Edward. Plus, Janice prefers not to meet after 13:00. Let's break down everyone's busy times first.\n\nStarting with Christine: Her busy periods are 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30. So her available slots are the gaps between these times. Let's note those.\n\nJanice is free all day, but she prefers before 13:00. So ideally, the meeting should be before 13:00 to accommodate her preference.\n\nBobby is busy at 12:00-12:30 and 14:30-15:00. So his available times are outside those.\n\nElizabeth has a lot of busy slots: 9:00-9:30, 11:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00. Her available times are between these blocks.\n\nTyler's busy times: 9:00-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So he's free between 11:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, etc.\n\nEdward's schedule: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00. His available times are 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00. Wait, but 15:30-16:00 is busy for Tyler. Hmm.\n\nSince Janice prefers before 13:00, let's focus on the morning slots first. Let's check each possible time window.\n\nFirst, let's look at 9:00-9:30. But Elizabeth is busy until 9:30, Christine starts at 9:30. So that's out.\n\nNext, 9:30-10:00. Christine is busy from 9:30-10:30, so she can't do 9:30-10:00. So no.\n\nThen 10:00-10:30. Christine is still busy (until 10:30). Edward is busy from 10:00-11:00. So Edward can't attend. So this time is out.\n\nLooking at 10:30-11:00. Christine is free after 10:30. Edward is busy 10:00-11:00. So Edward can't. So that's out.\n\nNext, 11:00-11:30. Edward is free from 11:00-11:30 (since his next busy is 11:30-14:00). Let's check others:\n\nChristine: free (her next busy is 12:00). Janice is free. Bobby is free (busy at 12:00). Elizabeth is free until 11:30. Tyler is free after 11:00 (his busy until 11:00). So from 11:00-11:30. Wait, Elizabeth is busy from 11:30-13:00. So at 11:00-11:30, Elizabeth is available. Let's see if there's a 30-minute slot here.\n\n11:00-11:30: Let's confirm each person's availability:\n\nChristine: 10:30-12:00 is free, so yes.\n\nJanice: Free.\n\nBobby: Free until 12:00, so yes.\n\nElizabeth: Her next busy is 11:30, so from 11:00-11:30 she's free.\n\nTyler: He's free from 11:00 onward until 12:00. So 11:00-11:30 works.\n\nEdward: He's free 11:00-11:30 (since his next busy is 11:30). So yes.\n\nSo 11:00-11:30 would work. But the meeting duration is 30 minutes. So that slot is possible. But let's check if all are available.\n\nYes, everyone is free during 11:00-11:30. Let's confirm:\n\nChristine: 10:30-12:00 free. So 11-11:30 is okay.\n\nJanice: Open.\n\nBobby: Busy at 12:00, so 11-11:30 is okay.\n\nElizabeth: Busy starts at 11:30, so 11-11:30 is okay.\n\nTyler: Free after 11:00, so yes.\n\nEdward: Free until 11:30. So yes.\n\nThis seems to fit. Also, Janice's preference is met since it's before 13:00.\n\nWait, are there any other possible slots? Let's check 12:30-13:00. But Janice prefers not after 13:00, but 12:30-13:00 is before 13:00. Let's see:\n\nChristine is busy 12:00-12:30, then free until 13:00. Bobby is busy until 12:30. Elizabeth is busy from 11:30-13:00, so she's unavailable. So that's out.\n\nAnother possible slot: 15:00-15:30. Let's check:\n\nChristine: busy 14:30-15:00, so free from 15:00 onward until 16:00.\n\nBobby: busy 14:30-15:00, then free.\n\nElizabeth: busy 15:00-15:30.\n\nSo Elizabeth is out. So no.\n\nWhat about 15:30-16:00? Christine is free until 16:00. But Edward is busy 14:30-15:30, so after 15:30 he's free until 16:00. But Tyler is busy 15:30-16:00. So Tyler can't attend. So that's out.\n\nAnother slot: 14:00-14:30. Edward is free from 14:00-14:30 (since he's busy 11:30-14:00 and then 14:30-15:30). Christine is free after 14:30-15:00. So 14:00-14:30. Let's check:\n\nChristine: She's busy 14:30-15:00, so before that, she's free. So 14:00-14:30 is okay.\n\nJanice: Available, but she prefers before 13:00. So this is after 13:00, but maybe acceptable if necessary. However, the problem says there's a solution that works with all constraints. So let's see if the 11:00-11:30 works, which is better for Janice.\n\nSo the best slot is 11:00-11:30. Let me make sure there's no conflicts here. All participants are available during that time. Yes, that's correct. So the JSON output would be time_range from 11:00 to 11:30 on Monday.",
