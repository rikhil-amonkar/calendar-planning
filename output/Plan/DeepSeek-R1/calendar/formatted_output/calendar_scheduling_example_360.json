            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where Emily, Mason, Maria, Carl, David, and Frank are all available. Let's start by listing each person's busy times and then look for gaps where everyone is free.\n\nFirst, Emily's busy periods are 10:00-10:30 and 16:00-16:30. Mason is free all day, so no problem there. Maria has meetings at 10:30-11:00 and 14:00-14:30. Carl's schedule is packed: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-12:30, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, and 16:00-17:00. David's blocked times are 9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, and 16:00-17:00. Frank is busy from 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:30, and 14:30-17:00.\n\nLet's break down the day into possible intervals and check each one.\n\nFrom 9:00 to 9:30: Check if everyone is free. Carl has a meeting at 9:30-10:00, but before 9:30, he's free. David is blocked from 9:30, so before 9:30, he's free. Frank's first meeting starts at 9:30, so he's free until then. Emily, Maria, Mason are free here. So 9:00-9:30 is a possible slot. But wait, the meeting duration is 30 minutes. So 9:00-9:30 works? Let me check again.\n\nYes, 9:00-9:30: Emily is free (her first meeting at 10:00). Mason is free. Maria is free. Carl is free until 9:30. David is free until 9:30. Frank is free until 9:30. So all are available. But wait, the problem says the meeting is between work hours of 9:00 to 17:00. So 9:00 is the start time. So 9:00-9:30 is valid. But let me check other possibilities as well to see if there's another slot.\n\nNext, check 11:00-11:30. Maria is free after 11:00? Maria's meetings are 10:30-11:00 and 14:00-14:30. So after 11:00, Maria is free. But Carl is busy until 12:30. From 10:30 to 12:30. So Carl is busy during 11:00-11:30. So that slot doesn't work. \n\nThen, look at 12:30-13:00. But David is blocked from 12:30-13:30. Frank is busy 12:30-13:30. Carl is free from 12:30 to 13:30? Wait, Carl's schedule is 10:30-12:30, then 13:30-14:00. So between 12:30-13:30, Carl is free. But David and Frank are busy here. So no.\n\nWhat about 13:00-13:30? David is blocked from 12:30-13:30. Frank is busy 12:30-13:30. So that's out.\n\nCheck 15:30-16:00. Carl is busy until 15:30 (14:30-15:30), then free until 16:00. David's blocked until 15:00 (14:00-15:00), then from 15:00-16:00, David is free? Let me check David's schedule. His blocked times include 14:00-15:00 and then 16:00-17:00. So between 15:00 and 16:00, David is free. Frank's last meeting is 14:30-17:00. So he's busy then. So 15:30-16:00 would have Frank busy. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother slot: 15:00-15:30. Carl is busy 14:30-15:30. So no. David is free from 15:00-16:00, but Carl is in a meeting. So that's not possible.\n\nLooking at 13:30-14:00. Carl has a meeting 13:30-14:00. Maria has a meeting at 14:00-14:30. So during 13:30-14:00, Carl is busy. So that's out.\n\nHow about 14:30-15:00? Carl is busy 14:30-15:30. Frank is busy 14:30-17:00. So that's no good.\n\nCheck 12:00-12:30. Carl's busy until 12:30. So after 12:30, he's free. But David is blocked 11:30-12:00 and then 12:30-13:30. So 12:00-12:30: Carl is busy until 12:30. So from 12:00-12:30, Carl is busy (10:30-12:30). So that's not possible.\n\nLooking at 11:30-12:00. David is blocked 11:30-12:00. So that's out.\n\nSo the only possible slot seems to be 9:00-9:30. Let me confirm again. Emily is free. Mason is free. Maria is free. Carl's first meeting is 9:30-10:00, so he's free until 9:30. David's blocked starts at 9:30, so he's free before that. Frank's first meeting is at 9:30, so he's free until then. So all are available from 9:00 to 9:30. That's a 30-minute window. So that's the answer.",
