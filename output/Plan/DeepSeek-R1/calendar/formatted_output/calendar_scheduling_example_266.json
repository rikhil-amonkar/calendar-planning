            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to find a half-hour slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where all five people\u2014Joe, Keith, Patricia, Nancy, and Pamela\u2014are available. Let me go through each person's schedule step by step.\n\nStarting with Joe: he's busy 9:30-10:00 and 10:30-11:00. So his available times are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, and after 11:00. Wait, but the work hours are 9-5, so maybe after 11:00 he's free until 17:00, except for those two meetings. Wait, no, his meetings are only the two mentioned. So Joe's available slots are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-17:00. Hmm, but let me check again. His first meeting is 9:30-10:00, so before that, from 9:00-9:30 he's free. Then from 10:00-10:30, since his next meeting is 10:30-11:00. Then after 11:00, he's free until 17:00, unless there are other meetings. But according to the data, those are his only meetings. So Joe's available times are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-17:00.\n\nNext, Keith. His blocked times are 11:30-12:00 and 15:00-15:30. So he's available except those times. So his available slots are 9:00-11:30, 12:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00.\n\nPatricia has blocked 9:00-9:30 and 13:00-13:30. So her available times are 9:30-13:00, 13:30-17:00.\n\nNancy's blocked times are 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-16:30. So she's available from 11:00-11:30 and 16:30-17:00. Wait, that's a very small window. Let me check again. From 9:00-11:00 she's busy. Then from 11:30-16:30. So between 11:00-11:30 she's free. Then after 16:30 until 17:00. So Nancy's available times are 11:00-11:30 and 16:30-17:00.\n\nPamela's blocked times are 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So her available slots are 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30.\n\nNow, we need to find a 30-minute window where all these people are available. Let's look for overlaps.\n\nStarting from earliest possible time. Let's list each person's available intervals and find the intersection.\n\nJoe: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-17:00\nKeith: 9:00-11:30, 12:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00\nPatricia: 9:30-13:00, 13:30-17:00\nNancy: 11:00-11:30, 16:30-17:00\nPamela: 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30\n\nLooking for overlaps among all.\n\nLet's check each possible time slot:\n\nFirst, Nancy's available times are only 11:00-11:30 and 16:30-17:00. So the meeting must be in one of these two slots. Let's check both.\n\nFirst slot: 11:00-11:30. Let's see if everyone else is available here.\n\nJoe is available from 11:00 onwards, so 11:00-11:30 is okay.\n\nKeith is available until 11:30, so 11:00-11:30 is within his 9:00-11:30 slot. So Keith is okay.\n\nPatricia's available until 13:00, so 11:00-11:30 is okay.\n\nPamela has 11:00-11:30 as available. So this slot works for all.\n\nWait, does that work? Let's confirm each person:\n\nJoe: 11:00-17:00 is free, so 11:00-11:30 is okay.\n\nKeith: 9:00-11:30 is his available, so 11:00-11:30 is okay.\n\nPatricia: 9:30-13:00, so 11:00-11:30 is within that.\n\nNancy: 11:00-11:30 is her available.\n\nPamela: 11:00-11:30 is listed as available. Yes.\n\nSo this seems like a valid slot. Let's check the duration. The meeting is half an hour. So from 11:00-11:30, that's 30 minutes. All participants are available here. That's the first possible slot.\n\nThe other possible slot is 16:30-17:00. Let's check if that works for everyone.\n\nNancy is available here. Now check others:\n\nJoe: available until 17:00, so 16:30-17:00 is okay.\n\nKeith's available 15:30-17:00, so yes.\n\nPatricia's available until 17:00, so okay.\n\nPamela's available 16:00-16:30, then blocked from 16:30-17:00. Wait, Pamela's blocked 16:30-17:00. So she's not available during 16:30-17:00. Therefore, this slot is not possible because Pamela is busy.\n\nSo the only possible slot is 11:00-11:30.\n\nWait, let me cross-verify Pamela's schedule again. Her blocked times include 16:30 to 17:00. So she can't attend at 16:30. Therefore, the 11:00-11:30 slot is the only one that works for all.",
