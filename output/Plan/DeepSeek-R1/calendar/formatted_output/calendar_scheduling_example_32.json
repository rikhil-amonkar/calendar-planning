            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 for Emily, Melissa, and Frank. Let's look at each person's schedule and Frank's constraint about not wanting to meet after 9:30. Wait, no\u2014Frank doesn't want to meet on Monday after 9:30? Wait, the original problem says Frank doesn't want to meet on Monday after 9:30. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because the work hours are 9-17, but Frank doesn't want to meet after 9:30. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's a typo? Or maybe Frank doesn't want to meet after 16:30? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"Frank do not want to meet on Monday after 9:30.\" So after 9:30 AM on Monday, Frank is unavailable. But his existing blocked times are from 10:00 onwards. So Frank's available only before 9:30? But the meeting has to be scheduled between 9:00 to 17:00. But if Frank can't meet after 9:30, then the only possible time is between 9:00 and 9:30. Let me check the schedules.\n\nEmily's Monday meetings: 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:30, 14:00-15:00, 16:00-16:30. So before 10:00, she's free from 9:00-10:00 except maybe the first 30 minutes. Wait, no\u2014Emily's first meeting is at 10:00. So she's free from 9:00 to 10:00, except maybe if there's something else. Wait, according to the given schedule, Emily's meetings start at 10:00. So from 9:00 to 10:00, she's free.\n\nMelissa's busy on Monday during 9:30-10:00. So she's free from 9:00 to 9:30.\n\nFrank's blocked times on Monday start at 10:00, but he also doesn't want to meet after 9:30. So his only available time is 9:00-9:30.\n\nSo all three are free from 9:00 to 9:30. The meeting needs to be 30 minutes. So the slot would be 9:00-9:30. Let's confirm:\n\nEmily: 9-10 is free, except she's available until her first meeting at 10:00.\n\nMelissa: 9-9:30 is free because her first meeting is 9:30-10:00.\n\nFrank: According to his blocked calendar, he's blocked starting at 10:00, but his constraint says he doesn't want to meet after 9:30. So his availability is 9:00-9:30.\n\nTherefore, the only possible time is 9:00-9:30. Let me check if that's a valid 30-minute slot. Yes, from 9:00 to 9:30 is 30 minutes. All three are available then. So that should be the answer.",
