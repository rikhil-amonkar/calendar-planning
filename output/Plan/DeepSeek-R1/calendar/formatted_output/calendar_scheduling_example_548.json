            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, Judy and Nicole need a half-hour meeting on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Judy's free all day, which is easy. Nicole has meetings from 9:00 to 10:00 and then again from 10:30 to 16:30. Plus, she prefers not to meet before 16:00. \n\nFirst, let's outline Nicole's busy times. She's busy from 9-10, then 10:30 to 16:30. So her free time on Monday would be the gaps outside those blocks. From 10:00 to 10:30, there's a 30-minute window, but that's before 16:00, which Nicole would rather avoid. Then after 16:30, she's free until 17:00.\n\nThe meeting needs to be 30 minutes. Let's check the available slots. The first possible slot is 10:00-10:30, but Nicole prefers after 16:00. The next available is after 16:30. From 16:30 to 17:00, there's exactly 30 minutes. Since Judy is free all day, this slot works for both. Plus, it's after 16:00, aligning with Nicole's preference. So the best time is 16:30 to 17:00 on Monday.",
