            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for Lisa and Anthony for half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. The goal is to find the earliest available time slot where both are free. Let me check their schedules step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list Lisa's busy times on Monday:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 10:30 to 11:00\n- 14:00 to 16:00\n\nAnthony's busy times:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 11:00 to 11:30\n- 12:30 to 13:30\n- 14:00 to 15:00\n- 15:30 to 16:00\n- 16:30 to 17:00\n\nWe need a 30-minute gap where both are free. Let's check the times in order.\n\nStarting from 9:00. Both are busy until 9:30. So next available slot starts at 9:30. Let's see if 9:30-10:00 works. Lisa is free from 9:30 until her next meeting at 10:30. Anthony's next meeting is at 11:00. So 9:30-10:00 is free for both? Wait, Anthony's schedule after 9:30 is free until 11:00. So yes, from 9:30 to 10:30, Anthony is free except for 11:00 to 11:30. Lisa is free from 9:30 to 10:30 except 10:30 to 11:00. Wait, Lisa is busy 10:30 to 11:00. So between 9:30 and 10:30, Lisa is free except for 10:30-11:00. So from 9:30 to 10:30, the available slots for Lisa are 9:30-10:30, but she has a meeting at 10:30. Wait, her busy time is 10:30-11:00. So Lisa is free from 9:30 to 10:30. So a 30-minute meeting could be from 9:30-10:00. Let's check Anthony's availability. He's free from 9:30 to 11:00, except his 11:00-11:30. So 9:30-11:00 is free for him. So 9:30-10:00 is free for both. Wait, that seems possible. Let me check again.\n\nLisa's schedule after 9:30:\n9:30-10:30 free (her next meeting is at 10:30-11:00). So she's free until 10:30. Then from 10:30 to 11:00 she's busy. Then after that until 14:00.\n\nAnthony's schedule after 9:30:\nHe's free from 9:30 to 11:00 (his next meeting is 11:00-11:30). So 9:30-11:00 is free.\n\nSo the first possible slot would be 9:30-10:00. Let me check if that's correct. Both are free during that time. Then, the next possible slot would be after that, but since the earliest is needed, 9:30-10:00 should be the answer. Wait, but let's check other possible slots in case I missed something.\n\nAfter 9:30-10:00, the next possible slot for Lisa would be from 11:00-14:00 (since she's busy 10:30-11:00 and 14:00-16:00). Anthony's free after 11:30 until 12:30. Then he's busy 12:30-13:30. Then free until 14:00. So maybe 11:30-12:00? Let's see. Lisa is free from 11:00 to 14:00. But Anthony is free from 11:30 to 12:30. So 11:30-12:00 would work. But 9:30-10:00 is earlier. So the earliest is 9:30-10:00.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me cross-verify. Both are free from 9:30 onwards. Lisa's next meeting is at 10:30, so until 10:30 she's free. Anthony's next meeting is at 11:00. So from 9:30 to 11:00, he's free. So between 9:30 and 10:30, Lisa is free. So the earliest possible 30-minute slot is 9:30-10:00. That works for both. Then, the next possible would be 10:00-10:30, but Lisa is free until 10:30. So 10:00-10:30 is also possible. But since the earliest is required, 9:30-10:00 is the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check Anthony's schedule again. After 9:30, he's free until 11:00. So 9:30-10:00 is free for him. Lisa's free 9:30-10:30. So yes, 9:30-10:00 is available. Therefore, the earliest time is 9:30-10:00 on Monday.",
