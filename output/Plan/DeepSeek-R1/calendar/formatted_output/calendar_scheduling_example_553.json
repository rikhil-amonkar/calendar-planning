            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, Eric and Henry need a 30-minute meeting on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Let me check their schedules and constraints.\n\nFirst, Eric's blocked times on Monday are 12:00-13:00 and 14:00-15:00. Henry has a bunch of meetings: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, and 16:00-17:00. Also, Henry prefers not to meet after 10:00 on Monday. Wait, but the meeting has to be between 9:00 and 17:00, but Henry would rather not after 10:00. Hmm, so ideally before 10:00, but maybe that's not possible. Let's see.\n\nSo, the available times for each person. Let's start by looking for free slots where both are available. Let's break down the day into possible intervals.\n\nFirst, before 9:30. The workday starts at 9:00. From 9:00 to 9:30, both Eric and Henry are free? Eric's schedule doesn't mention anything before 12:00 except those blocks. So Eric is free from 9:00-12:00 except 12:00-13:00 is blocked. Wait, no: Eric's blocked from 12:00-13:00 and 14:00-15:00. So before 12:00, Eric is available except for any other blocks. The problem states that Eric's existing schedule is as mentioned. So Eric is available from 9:00-12:00, except for the 12:00-13:00 block. Wait, no\u2014Eric's blocked from 12:00 to 13:00. So up until 12:00, Eric is available except if there are other blocks. But according to the given info, Eric's only blocked during 12:00-13:00 and 14:00-15:00. So from 9:00 to 12:00, Eric is free. Henry's schedule during that time: he has meetings from 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30. So let's see the gaps in Henry's schedule before 12:30.\n\nHenry's first meeting is 9:30-10:00. So from 9:00 to 9:30, he's free. Then after 10:00 until 10:30 he has a gap. Then 10:30-11:00 is a meeting. Then from 11:00 to 11:30, he's free. Then 11:30-12:30 is a meeting. So Henry's available slots before 12:30 are:\n\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 11:00-11:30\n\nNow, check Eric's availability during those times. Since Eric is free from 9:00-12:00, all of Henry's gaps here are possible. So possible slots are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30. Each of these is 30 minutes, which is exactly the duration needed. But Henry prefers not to meet after 10:00. So the ideal time would be before 10:00, which is the 9:00-9:30 slot. Let's check if both are free then.\n\nEric is free at 9:00-9:30. Henry's first meeting starts at 9:30, so he's free from 9:00 to 9:30. So that's a possible slot. But wait, the meeting is 30 minutes. So from 9:00 to 9:30. That works for both. And since Henry prefers not to meet after 10:00, this would be the best option.\n\nBut let's confirm if there's any other constraints. The problem says there exists a solution that works with everyone's schedule. So maybe that's the slot. But wait, let's check other possible times in case I missed something.\n\nAfter 12:30, Henry has 13:00-13:30, then 14:30-15:00, and 16:00-17:00. Eric is blocked from 12:00-13:00 and 14:00-15:00. So between 13:00 and 14:00, Eric is free (since his next block is 14:00). Let's see: From 13:00-14:00, Eric is available. Henry has a meeting from 13:00-13:30. So after 13:30, Henry is free until 14:30. So 13:30-14:00 is available for Henry, but Eric is free then. So 13:30-14:00 is a possible 30-minute slot. But Henry's preference is not to meet after 10:00. However, the problem says to find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. The preference is not a hard constraint, just a \"rather not\". Since the user mentioned that a solution exists, perhaps the 9:00-9:30 slot is available. Let me double-check.\n\nYes, 9:00-9:30: Eric is free, Henry is free. The meeting is 30 minutes. That fits, and meets Henry's preference. So why would the solution not be that? Unless there's a conflict I missed. Let me check again.\n\nHenry's meetings start at 9:30. So he's free from 9:00 to 9:30. Eric has no meetings then. So yes, that's a valid slot. But wait, the problem says \"Henry would rather not meet on Monday after 10:00\", so he prefers before 10:00. The 9:00-9:30 slot is before 10:00, so that's ideal. So why isn't that the solution?\n\nWait, the sample solution might have a different answer. Wait, the user hasn't provided a sample solution here. Wait, in the TASK description, the SOLUTION is expected to be provided by me. So maybe the correct answer is 9:00-9:30. Let me confirm again.\n\nAnother possible slot after 10:00 is 10:00-10:30, but Henry has a meeting at 10:30-11:00, so he's free from 10:00 to 10:30. Eric is free then. But Henry would rather not meet after 10:00. So the preference is to avoid after 10:00, but the meeting could still be scheduled there if necessary. However, since the 9:00-9:30 slot is available, that's better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in the schedule. Let's check again.\n\nWait, Henry's meetings on Monday are 9:30-10:00, so his first meeting is 9:30. So from 9:00-9:30, he's free. Eric is free then. So that's a perfect slot. So why would there be another answer? Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Henry would rather not meet on Monday after 10:00\". So he prefers not to, but if necessary, it's allowed. But since there's a slot before 10:00, that's the best option.\n\nSo the answer should be Monday, 9:00-9:30.",
