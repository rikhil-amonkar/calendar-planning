            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So Cheryl and Kyle need a 30-minute meeting between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. But Cheryl can't meet on Wednesday. So days to consider are Monday and Tuesday.\n\nFirst, let's check their schedules on Monday. Cheryl is busy from 9:00-9:30, 11:30-13:00, 15:30-16:00. Kyle's entire Monday is busy from 9:00 to 17:00. Wait, that's impossible. Kyle has no free time on Monday. So Monday is out. Then we must look at Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cheryl is busy from 15:00-15:30. Kyle is busy from 9:30 to 17:00. Wait, Kyle's schedule says he's busy Tuesday 9:30 to 17:00. So he's available before 9:30? Let me check again. The problem states Kyle is busy on Monday during 9:00-17:00, Tuesday during 9:30 to 17:00, etc. So on Tuesday, Kyle is free from 9:00 to 9:30, right? Because his busy time starts at 9:30. So from 9:00 to 9:30 on Tuesday, he's free. \n\nNow Cheryl's schedule on Tuesday: she's busy 15:00-15:30, but that's in the afternoon. So in the morning, before 9:30, Cheryl's available? Because her Tuesday busy time starts at 15:00. So on Tuesday morning, from 9:00 to 9:30, Cheryl is free. And Kyle is also free then. \n\nSo the only available slot is Tuesday 9:00-9:30. That's a 30-minute window. Perfect for the meeting. Let me confirm: Cheryl's unavailable on Wednesday, so Tuesday is the only possible day. Both are free from 9:00-9:30 on Tuesday. No conflicts there. That should work.",
