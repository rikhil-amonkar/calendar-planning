            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting between Nicole and Ruth. The meeting should be half an hour long, between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. But Ruth doesn't want to meet on Wednesday after 13:30. Also, their existing schedules are provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's check each day one by one.\n\nStarting with Monday. Nicole's busy on Monday from 9:00-9:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:30. Ruth's entire Monday is blocked from 9:00 to 17:00. So Monday is out because Ruth can't meet at all that day.\n\nNext, Tuesday. Nicole's busy on Tuesday at 9:00-9:30, 11:30-13:30, 14:30-15:30. Ruth is busy all day Tuesday from 9:00 to 17:00. Wait, no\u2014Ruth's calendar is blocked on Tuesday during 9:00 to 17:00. So Ruth can't meet on Tuesday either. So Tuesday is also out.\n\nNow, Wednesday. Let's look at both their schedules and Ruth's preference not to meet after 13:30 on Wednesday.\n\nNicole's Wednesday schedule: busy from 10:00-11:00, 12:30-15:00, 16:00-17:00. Ruth's Wednesday schedule: blocked from 9:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-15:30, 16:00-16:30. Also, Ruth doesn't want to meet after 13:30, so any time after 13:30 on Wednesday is excluded.\n\nSo possible times on Wednesday must be before 13:30. Let's check the available slots.\n\nFirst, the work hours start at 9:00. Ruth is busy until 10:30. Nicole is free from 9:00 to 10:00 except for 10:00-11:00. Wait, Nicole is busy 10:00-11:00. Ruth is busy until 10:30. So from 10:30 to 11:00, Ruth is free except for 11:00-11:30. But Nicole is busy 10:00-11:00. So between 10:30 and 11:00, Nicole is still busy (since her block ends at 11). So that's not possible.\n\nNext slot after Ruth's 10:30 block. Then Ruth has a block at 11:00-11:30. So between 10:30 to 11:00, but Nicole is busy until 11. So maybe after 11:30?\n\nWait, Ruth's next free time after 10:30 would be after 11:30? Let's check. Ruth's Wednesday schedule: after 10:30, next blocked is 11:00-11:30, then 12:00-12:30. So the available slots on Wednesday for Ruth are:\n\n- 10:30-11:00 (but Nicole is busy until 11:00)\n- 11:30-12:00 (Ruth is free here)\n- 12:30-13:30 (since Ruth can't meet after 13:30, but up to 13:30 is allowed)\n\nWait, Ruth's blocked from 12:00-12:30. So from 12:30 to 13:30, but Nicole's schedule on Wednesday includes 12:30-15:00. So Nicole is busy from 12:30 to 15:00. That means during 12:30-13:30, Nicole is busy. So that's not available.\n\nSo let's check the available slots again. For Wednesday:\n\nRuth's available times before 13:30:\n\nBetween 10:30-11:00 (but Nicole is busy until 11:00)\nBetween 11:30-12:00 (Ruth free)\nBetween 12:30-13:30 (Nicole busy)\n\nWait, Ruth is free from 11:30 to 12:00? Let's confirm. Ruth's Wednesday blocks: 9-10:30, 11-11:30, 12-12:30. So between 10:30-11:00, Ruth is free. Then 11-11:30 blocked. Then 11:30-12:00 free? No, wait. Ruth's blocked 11:00-11:30, so from 11:30 onwards, Ruth is free until 12:00. So 11:30-12:00 is available for Ruth.\n\nNow, during that time, Nicole's schedule on Wednesday: she's busy 10-11:00, 12:30-15:00, etc. So between 11:00 and 12:30, Nicole is free except for maybe other blocks. Wait, Nicole's schedule on Wednesday is 10:00-11:00, 12:30-15:00, 16:00-17:00. So between 11:00 and 12:30, Nicole is free. So from 11:00 to 12:30, Nicole is available except for 12:30-15:00. So from 11:00 to 12:30, she's free except that 12:30 is when her next block starts.\n\nSo the possible time on Wednesday is 11:30-12:00 for Ruth, and Nicole is free from 11:00 to 12:30. So a 30-minute meeting could be scheduled between 11:30-12:00. Let's check if both are free during that time.\n\nRuth is free from 11:30-12:00 (her block ends at 11:30). Nicole is free from 11:00-12:30. So that time slot works. But wait, Nicole's next block is at 12:30, so 11:30-12:00 is clear for her. Ruth is free then. And the meeting is before 13:30, so it meets Ruth's preference. So that's a possible slot.\n\nAnother possible time: let's check 15:30-16:00. Wait, Ruth's Wednesday schedule is blocked until 15:30 (13:30-15:30), then 16:00-16:30. But Ruth doesn't want to meet after 13:30 on Wednesday, so even if there was a slot after, it's invalid.\n\nSo the only possible time is 11:30-12:00 on Wednesday. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Ruth's available on Wednesday after 10:30 until 11:00, but Nicole is busy until 11:00. Then from 11:00-11:30, Ruth is blocked (11-11:30). So from 11:30-12:00, Ruth is free. Nicole is free from 11:00-12:30. So 11:30-12:00 is a 30-minute window where both are available. That seems correct.\n\nYes, that should work. So the proposed time is Wednesday, 11:30 to 12:00.",
