            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, the goal is to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for all seven people: Andrea, Ruth, Steven, Grace, Kyle, Elijah, and Lori. Grace has no meetings, which is helpful. Let me list out everyone's busy times first to visualize the gaps.\n\nAndrea's busy periods are 9:30-10:30 and 13:30-14:30. Ruth has 12:30-13:00 and 15:00-15:30. Steven's schedule is a bit packed with multiple half-hour blocks: 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-14:00, and 15:00-16:00. Kyle's busy times are 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. Elijah has 9:00-11:00, 11:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. Lori's busy times are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30, 12:00-13:30, 14:00-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nNow, let's look for gaps where none of these people are busy. Starting from 9:00, but Andrea is busy from 9:30, and others have earlier blocks. Let's check each hour:\n\nBetween 9:00-9:30: Kyle, Elijah, Lori are busy. So no.\n\n9:30-10:00: Andrea is busy until 10:30. Ruth is free here? Wait, Ruth's first busy time is 12:30. But Andrea's busy until 10:30. So this slot is blocked by Andrea and others. Wait, Steven is busy from 10:00-10:30. So maybe 9:30-10:00 is blocked by Andrea. So that's out.\n\nNext, after 10:30. Let's see. Kyle is busy from 10:30-12:00. Lori is busy 10:00-11:30. Elijah is busy until 11:00. So from 11:00-11:30, Steven is busy at 11:00-11:30. Elijah is free after 11:00? Wait, Elijah's next busy slot is 11:30-13:00. So from 11:00-11:30, Elijah is free, but Steven is busy. So that's no good.\n\nThen, maybe after 11:30. But Elijah is busy 11:30-13:00. Ruth is free except 12:30-13:00. Lori is busy until 13:30. Steven has a block at 12:00-12:30. So maybe looking for a slot after 13:30? Let's check.\n\nAfter 13:30: Andrea is busy until 14:30. Steven is busy 13:30-14:00. Kyle is busy until 15:00. Lori is busy until 14:00, then again from 14:00-16:00. Elijah is busy 13:30-14:00. So from 14:00-16:00, Lori is busy. Kyle is busy until 15:00. Steven is free after 14:00 until 15:00 (but Steven's next busy is 15:00-16:00). Ruth is free except 15:00-15:30. So maybe after 15:00?\n\nWait, from 15:00-15:30: Ruth is busy, Steven is busy (15:00-16:00), Kyle is busy until 15:00, then 15:30-16:00. Elijah is free at 15:00-15:30? No, Elijah has 15:30-16:00 and 16:30-17:00. Wait, Elijah's busy times are 15:30-16:00. So at 15:00-15:30, Elijah is free. But Steven is busy 15:00-16:00. So that's a problem. So 15:00-15:30 is blocked by Steven and Ruth.\n\nThen, after 15:30? Kyle is busy 15:30-16:00. Elijah is busy 15:30-16:00. Lori is busy until 16:00. So 16:00-16:30: Lori is free until 16:30? Wait, Lori's schedule says 14:00-16:00, then 16:30-17:00. So 16:00-16:30 Lori is free. Kyle is busy 16:30-17:00, but 16:00-16:30 is free for him? Let me check Kyle's schedule: 16:30-17:00 is busy, but his earlier slots are 15:30-16:00. So 16:00-16:30 is free. Steven is busy until 16:00, so he's free after 16:00? Steven's last busy slot is 15:00-16:00, so from 16:00 onward he's free. Ruth's last busy is 15:00-15:30, so she's free after 15:30. Andrea is free after 14:30. Elijah is free from 16:00-16:30? Elijah's busy times are 15:30-16:00 and 16:30-17:00. So 16:00-16:30 is free. Lori is free 16:00-16:30. Grace is free all day. So 16:00-16:30 seems possible. Let's confirm each person's availability at that time.\n\nAndrea: No conflicts after 14:30. Available.\nRuth: After 15:30, no conflicts. Available.\nSteven: After 16:00, free. Available.\nGrace: Available.\nKyle: 16:00-16:30 is free (his next busy is 16:30-17:00). So available.\nElijah: 16:00-16:30 is free. Available.\nLori: 16:00-16:30 is free. Available.\n\nSo 16:00-16:30 works for everyone. That's a 30-minute slot. Let me double-check each person's schedule again to make sure there's no overlap.\n\nAndrea: No meetings then.\nRuth: Her last meeting ends at 15:30.\nSteven: His last meeting ends at 16:00.\nGrace: Free.\nKyle: Between 15:30-16:00 is busy, so 16:00-16:30 is free.\nElijah: Free from 16:00-16:30.\nLori: Free from 16:00-16:30.\n\nYes, that slot works. So the answer is Monday, 16:00-16:30.",
