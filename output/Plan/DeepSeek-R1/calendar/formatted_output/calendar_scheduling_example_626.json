            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out when Patricia and Jesse can meet. The meeting needs to be one hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday or Tuesday. Let's check their schedules day by day.\n\nStarting with Monday. Patricia has several meetings: 10-10:30, 11:30-12, 1-1:30, 2:30-3:30, 4-4:30. But wait, Jesse's calendar is blocked all day on Monday from 9 to 5. So Monday is out. So the meeting has to be on Tuesday.\n\nNow, looking at Tuesday. Patricia's schedule: meetings at 10-10:30, 11-12, 2-4, 4:30-5. Jesse has blocked times on Tuesday: 11-11:30, 12-12:30, 1-2, 2:30-3, 3:30-5. Let's find the gaps where both are free.\n\nFirst, check the morning. Before 10, Patricia is free from 9 to 10. But Jesse's blocked times on Tuesday start at 11, so before 11. Wait, Jesse's blocked on Tuesday from 11 onwards, except for some gaps. Wait, let me list Jesse's Tuesday blocks again: 11-11:30, 12-12:30, 1-2, 2:30-3, 3:30-5. So outside these blocks, Jesse is free. Let's see:\n\nJesse's free periods on Tuesday would be:\n9:00-11:00 (since first block is at 11)\n11:30-12:00 (between 11:30 and 12)\n12:30-13:00 (between 12:30 and 1)\n14:00-14:30 (from 2 PM to 2:30 PM)\n15:00-15:30 (3 PM to 3:30 PM)\n\nWait, wait. Let me reconstruct Jesse's Tuesday schedule properly. The blocks are: 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00. So the free times are:\n\nFrom 9:00 to 11:00 (before the first block)\nBetween 11:30 to 12:00 (after first block, before next)\nBetween 12:30 to 13:00 (after 12:30 block)\nBetween 14:00 to 14:30 (after 13-14 block, but Jesse has 14:30-15:00 blocked)\nWait, Jesse's Tuesday blocks are 11:00-11:30, then 12:00-12:30, then 13:00-14:00, then 14:30-15:00, then 15:30-17:00. So the free slots are:\n\n9:00-11:00\n11:30-12:00\n12:30-13:00\n14:00-14:30 (because 13-14 is blocked, then next block is 14:30)\n15:00-15:30 (after 14:30-15:00 block, next block is 15:30)\n\nNow, Patricia's schedule on Tuesday: meetings at 10-10:30, 11-12, 14-16, 16:30-17. So Patricia's free times on Tuesday would be:\n\n9:00-10:00 (before her first meeting)\n10:30-11:00 (after 10-10:30)\n12:00-14:00 (between 11-12 and 14-16 meetings)\n16:00-16:30 (between 14-16 and 16:30-17)\n\nWait, Patricia's meetings on Tuesday are 10:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So free times for Patricia:\n\nFrom 9:00-10:00 (before first meeting)\n10:30-11:00 (between 10:30 and 11)\n12:00-14:00 (after 11-12 meeting until next at 14)\n16:00-16:30 (after 14-16 meeting and before 16:30)\n\nNow, we need to find a one-hour slot where both are free.\n\nLet's check Jesse's free slots against Patricia's.\n\nJesse's first free slot: 9:00-11:00. Patricia is free 9-10 and 10:30-11. So possible overlaps here:\n\n9:00-10:00 (Patricia free here, Jesse free here). So 9-10 is possible? Let's check. But Patricia is free 9-10. Jesse is free 9-11. So 9-10 is available. Wait, but Patricia's first meeting is at 10:00. So she's free from 9 to 10. So 9-10 is available for both. But wait, the meeting duration is one hour, so 9-10 would work. But let's check if there are any other constraints. The work hours are 9-17, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Patricia is free 9-10 on Tuesday. Jesse is free 9-11 on Tuesday. So 9-10 is a possible slot. But let's check Patricia's schedule again. Yes, on Tuesday, Patricia's first meeting is at 10:00. So she's free from 9 to 10. Jesse is free 9-11. So 9-10 is available. But wait, the user said there exists a solution, so maybe this is the answer. But let's check other possibilities.\n\nNext, Jesse's slot 11:30-12:00. That's 30 minutes. Not enough for a one-hour meeting.\n\nJesse's 12:30-13:00: 30 minutes again. Not enough.\n\nJesse's 14:00-14:30: 30 minutes. Patricia's free 12-14? Wait, Patricia's free from 12:00 to 14:00 (since her next meeting is at 14:00). Wait, Patricia's meeting on Tuesday is 14:00-16:00. So she's free from 12:00 (after 11-12) until 14:00. So 12-14 is free. But Jesse's free at 14:00-14:30. Wait, Patricia's 14:00 meeting starts exactly at 14:00. So she's not available at 14:00. So Patricia's free until 14:00, so 12:00 to 14:00. So during Jesse's 14:00-14:30 slot, Patricia is in a meeting. So that's no good.\n\nJesse's 15:00-15:30: Patricia is in a meeting from 14:00 to 16:00. So during 15-16, she's in a meeting. So 15:00-15:30 is during her meeting. So no overlap.\n\nWait, Patricia's Tuesday 14-16 is a meeting. So she's busy from 14:00 to 16:00. So 15:00-15:30 is during that time. So Jesse's 15:00-15:30 is not overlapping with Patricia's free time.\n\nSo the only possible slot is 9:00-10:00 on Tuesday. Let me check that. Both are free then. But let's verify again.\n\nPatricia's Tuesday meetings: 10-10:30, so 9-10 is free. Jesse's Tuesday blocks: starts at 11:00. So 9-11 is free for Jesse. Therefore, 9-10 is available for both. So that's a one-hour slot. But wait, the problem says that there is a solution, so maybe that's the answer. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.\" So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a slot. Let's check all possibilities again.\n\nJesse's free times on Tuesday:\n\n9:00-11:00\n\n11:30-12:00\n\n12:30-13:00\n\n14:00-14:30\n\n15:00-15:30\n\nPatricia's free times on Tuesday:\n\n9:00-10:00\n\n10:30-11:00\n\n12:00-14:00\n\n16:00-16:30\n\nSo overlapping periods:\n\nFor 9-10: Both free.\n\nFor 10:30-11:00: Patricia is free here, Jesse is free until 11:00. So 10:30-11:00 is 30 minutes. Not enough.\n\nPatricia's 12:00-14:00. Jesse's free 12:30-13:00. So 12:30-13:00. But that's 30 minutes. Not enough.\n\nJesse's 14:00-14:30: Patricia is in a meeting starting at 14:00, so she's not available.\n\nPatricia's 16:00-16:30: Jesse is blocked from 15:30-17:00, so 16-16:30 is blocked.\n\nWait, Jesse's blocked from 15:30 to 17:00 on Tuesday. So 16-16:30 is blocked. So Patricia's 16-16:30 is during Jesse's blocked time. So no overlap there.\n\nSo the only possible slot is 9-10 on Tuesday. But wait, in the example given, the answer was Tuesday 14:30-15:30, but maybe that's a different scenario. Wait no, that's a different example. So in this case, the correct answer is Tuesday 9-10 AM?\n\nBut let me check Jesse's calendar again. On Tuesday, Jesse's calendar is blocked from 11:00 onwards except for the specified breaks. But before 11, he's free. So 9-10 is free. Patricia is also free then. So that's the slot. So why isn't that the answer?\n\nBut the user says \"Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.\" So maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Patricia's Tuesday schedule: 10:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So from 9 to 10 she's free. Jesse is free from 9 to 11. So 9-10 is possible. But why didn't the example solution pick that? Wait, the example solution here is the one for the given task, which is this one. Wait, no, in the problem statement, the user provided a task and expects me to provide the solution. Wait, the user provided an example task and solution, but this current problem is the actual task I need to solve. So perhaps the correct answer is Tuesday 9-10.\n\nBut wait, in the initial problem description, the user says \"Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.\" So 9-10 should work. Let me confirm once more.\n\nYes, Patricia is free 9-10 on Tuesday, Jesse is free 9-11. So 9-10 is a valid one-hour slot. That's the answer.",
