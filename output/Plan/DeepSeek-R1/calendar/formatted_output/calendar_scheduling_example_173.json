            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, the goal is to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Jacqueline, Harold, Arthur, Kelly. Also, Harold doesn't want to meet after 13:00. Let's break down each person's schedule and see where there's overlap.\n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's busy times:\n\nJacqueline:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 15:30-16:00\n\nHarold:\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 15:00-17:00\nBut he doesn't want to meet after 13:00, so his availability is effectively before 13:00, except his 10-10:30 and 13:00-13:30 are already busy. Wait, wait. Wait, Harold's busy times include up to 17:00, but he doesn't want to meet after 13:00. So his available time is 9:00-10:00, 10:30-13:00. But his existing busy times are 10-10:30 and 13:00-13:30. So subtracting those, his available times are 9:00-10:00, 10:30-13:00, but he can't meet after 13:00. So his available slots are 9:00-10:00, 10:30-13:00, but he has a meeting at 13:00-13:30, but since he doesn't want to meet after 13:00, even if that's a meeting, maybe the 13:00 is the cutoff. So Harold is available up until 13:00, except when he's busy. So available times for Harold would be:\n\nFrom 9:00-10:00 (since 10-10:30 is busy), then from 10:30-13:00, but not including after 13:00. Wait, but his busy time at 13:00-13:30 is after 13:00, which he already doesn't want to meet. So Harold's available time is 9:00-10:00, and 10:30-13:00. But he can't have meetings after 13:00. So any time after 13:00 is off-limits for Harold, regardless of his schedule.\n\nArthur's schedule:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-12:30\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 15:30-17:00\n\nSo Arthur is busy in those blocks. So his available times would be 9:30-10:00, 12:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30. But wait, 12:30-14:30? Wait, Arthur's busy from 10:00-12:30, so after 12:30 he's free until 14:30. Then from 14:30-15:00 he's busy again. Then 15:00-15:30 free, then busy again from 15:30-17:00.\n\nKelly's schedule:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-11:00\n- 11:30-12:30\n- 14:00-15:00\n- 15:30-16:00\n\nSo Kelly's available times would be 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00. But since Harold can't meet after 13:00, we can ignore times after 13:00. Wait, because Harold's constraint is that he doesn't want to meet after 13:00, so the meeting has to be scheduled before 13:00. So let's focus on the time between 9:00-13:00.\n\nNow, let's look for 30-minute slots where all four are available, and within Harold's allowed time (before 13:00).\n\nLooking at each person's available times in the morning up to 13:00:\n\nJacqueline's available before 13:00:\nShe's busy 9-9:30, 11-11:30, 12:30-13:00. So available:\n9:30-11:00, 11:30-12:30.\n\nHarold's available:\n9:00-10:00, 10:30-13:00. But he can't meet after 13:00, so up to 13:00. But his existing busy times are 10-10:30 and 13:00-13:30. So his available is 9:00-10:00 and 10:30-13:00. But since the meeting must end by 13:00 (because he doesn't want to meet after), the latest the meeting can end is 13:00, so latest start is 12:30.\n\nArthur's available before 13:00:\nHis busy times before 13:00 are 9-9:30, 10:00-12:30. So available:\n9:30-10:00, 12:30-13:00. But Arthur's available at 12:30-13:00? Wait, his schedule says he has a meeting 10:00-12:30. So from 12:30 onwards, he's free. So before 13:00, Arthur is available 12:30-13:00, but that's conflicting with Jacqueline's 12:30-13:00 block. So Arthur's available in the morning is 9:30-10:00 and 12:30-13:00. But since Harold can't meet after 13:00, the 12:30-13:00 slot would end at 13:00, which is okay. But Jacqueline is busy from 12:30-13:00, so that slot is out.\n\nKelly's available before 13:00:\nHer busy times are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:30. So available:\n9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00. But again, since Harold can't meet after 13:00, the 12:30-13:00 slot would need to end by 13:00.\n\nSo let's look for overlaps:\n\nPossible time slots:\n\n1. 9:30-10:00: Check all four.\n\nJacqueline: available 9:30-11:00. Yes.\nHarold: available 9:00-10:00. So 9:30-10:00 is okay.\nArthur: available 9:30-10:00. Yes.\nKelly: available 9:30-10:00. Yes.\n\nSo this slot works. But wait, let's check. All four are free from 9:30-10:00?\n\nJacqueline: yes, she's free from 9:30-11:00.\nHarold: he's free 9:00-10:00, except for 10-10:30. So 9:30-10:00 is okay.\nArthur: he's free 9:30-10:00.\nKelly: she's free 9:30-10:00.\n\nYes, this slot is available. But wait, Harold's schedule shows he's busy 10:00-10:30, but the slot is 9:30-10:00. That's fine. So 9:30-10:00 is a possible slot. However, the meeting duration is 30 minutes, so 9:30-10:00 is exactly 30 minutes. So this works.\n\nAnother possible slot could be 11:00-11:30, but Jacqueline is busy then (11-11:30). So that's out.\n\nWhat about 11:30-12:00? Let's check:\n\nJacqueline: available 11:30-12:30. So yes.\nHarold: available 10:30-13:00. So 11:30-12:00 is okay.\nArthur: busy until 12:30. So he's busy until 12:30. So 11:30-12:00 is during his 10:00-12:30 block. So Arthur is busy. So that's out.\n\nNext, 12:30-13:00. But Jacqueline is busy 12:30-13:00. So no.\n\nWhat about 12:00-12:30? Let's see:\n\nJacqueline is available until 12:30. So 12:00-12:30 is part of her 11:30-12:30 available? Wait, Jacqueline's busy at 12:30-13:00. Wait, her available times are 9:30-11:00, then 11:30-12:30. So 11:30-12:30 is available. So 12:00-12:30 is okay.\n\nHarold is available until 13:00, so 12:00-12:30 is okay.\n\nArthur is busy until 12:30. So any time before 12:30, he's busy. So 12:00-12:30 is during his 10:00-12:30 block. So Arthur is busy. So that's out.\n\nAnother possible slot: 10:30-11:00. Let's check:\n\nJacqueline is available 9:30-11:00. So 10:30-11:00 is okay.\nHarold is available 10:30-13:00. So okay.\nArthur is busy 10:00-12:30. So 10:30-11:00 is during his busy time. So Arthur is busy. So that's out.\n\nSo the only available slot where all four are free is 9:30-10:00. That's 30 minutes. Let me double-check:\n\nJacqueline: 9:30-10:00 is free (she's busy until 9:30, then free until 11:00).\nHarold: free from 9:00-10:00 (since his next meeting is at 10:00-10:30).\nArthur: free from 9:30-10:00 (after his 9:00-9:30 meeting).\nKelly: free from 9:30-10:00 (after her 9:00-9:30 meeting).\n\nYes, all four are free. So the answer should be 9:30-10:00 on Monday.",
