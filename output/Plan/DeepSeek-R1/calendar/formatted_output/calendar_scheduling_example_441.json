            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday for Joan, Megan, Austin, Betty, Judith, Terry, and Kathryn. Let me go through each person's schedule step by step.\n\nFirst, Austin is free all day, so no constraints there. Let's list everyone else's busy times:\n\nJoan:\n- 11:30-12:00\n- 14:30-15:00\n\nMegan:\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 14:00-14:30\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nBetty:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 11:30-12:00\n- 13:30-14:00\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nJudith:\n- 9:00-11:00\n- 12:00-13:00\n- 14:00-15:00\n\nTerry:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 11:30-12:30\n- 13:00-14:00\n- 15:00-15:30\n- 16:00-17:00\n\nKathryn:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 11:30-13:00\n- 14:00-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nNow, let's look for gaps where all are free. The work hours are 9-17, so possible slots are from 9:00 to 17:00, but we need 30 minutes.\n\nLet's break down the day into intervals and check each one.\n\nStarting from 9:00:\n\n- 9:00-9:30: Megan is busy until 10:00. Judith is busy until 11:00. So this time is out.\n\n- 9:30-10:00: Megan is busy until 10:00. Betty, Terry, and Kathryn have meetings here. So no.\n\n10:00-10:30: Check if anyone's busy. Judith is still busy until 11:00. Joan is free. Megan is free from 10:00. But Kathryn has a meeting at 10:30-11:00. Wait, from 10:00 to 10:30: Let's see. Judith is busy until 11:00, so she can't meet until 11:00. So this time is out.\n\n10:30-11:00: Judith is still busy (until 11:00). Kathryn has a meeting here. So no.\n\n11:00-11:30: Judith is free from 11:00 to 12:00? Wait, Judith's blocked times are 9-11, 12-13, 14-15. So from 11:00 to 12:00, Judith is free. But Joan has a meeting at 11:30-12:00. Also, Betty has 11:30-12:00. Terry is busy 11:30-12:30. Kathryn has 11:30-13:00. So 11:00-11:30: Let's check.\n\nAt 11:00-11:30:\n\nJoan is free until 11:30.\n\nMegan is free (her next meeting is 14:00).\n\nBetty is free (her next meeting at 11:30).\n\nJudith is free.\n\nTerry is free until 11:30 (his next is 11:30-12:30).\n\nKathryn is free until 11:30 (her next is 11:30-13:00).\n\nSo from 11:00 to 11:30, everyone is free? Let me verify:\n\nJoan: 11:30 is her next, so 11-11:30 is free.\n\nMegan: free until 14:00.\n\nBetty: her next is 11:30, so 11-11:30 is free.\n\nJudith: free until 12:00.\n\nTerry: free until 11:30.\n\nKathryn: free until 11:30.\n\nSo 11:00-11:30 is a possible slot. Wait, that's 30 minutes. Let me check again.\n\nYes, 11:00-11:30. Does that work for all? Let's confirm each person:\n\nJoan: no meetings here.\n\nMegan: free.\n\nAustin: free.\n\nBetty: free (her next meeting is 11:30, so 11-11:30 is okay.\n\nJudith: free.\n\nTerry: free until 11:30.\n\nKathryn: free until 11:30.\n\nYes, this seems to work. Let me check other possible slots in case there's another time.\n\nNext possible slot after 11:30:\n\nFrom 12:00 onwards. Let's check.\n\n12:00-12:30: Judith is busy 12-13. So she can't.\n\n13:00-13:30: Judith is free (her blocked time is 12-13, so after 13:00). Wait, Judith's blocked times are 12-13, so at 13:00 she's free? Wait, blocked until 13:00. So from 13:00 onwards, she's free except 14-15.\n\nAt 13:00-13:30: Let's check.\n\nJoan is free (her next is 14:30).\n\nMegan: free until 14:00.\n\nBetty: has a meeting at 13:30-14:00. So 13:00-13:30 is free.\n\nJudith: free (12-13 blocked, so after 13:00 free).\n\nTerry: busy 13:00-14:00. So he can't attend.\n\nSo Terry is busy, so this slot is out.\n\nThen, after 14:00:\n\nJudith is busy 14-15.\n\nMegan has 14:00-14:30.\n\nBetty has 13:30-14:00, so after 14:00 she's free until 16:00 except maybe others.\n\nTerry's next is 15:00-15:30. So between 14:00-15:00, Terry is busy? Let me check Terry's schedule: he has 13:00-14:00, then 15:00-15:30. So between 14:00-15:00, Terry is free. Wait, no: after 14:00, Terry's next is 15:00. So 14:00-15:00: Terry is free? Wait, his schedule is 13:00-14:00, then next is 15:00-15:30. So from 14:00 to 15:00, Terry is free.\n\nBut Judith is busy 14-15. So any time between 14-15 is out because Judith can't. Then after 15:00.\n\n15:00-15:30: Judith is free (after 15:00). Joan has a meeting until 15:00. Wait Joan has 14:30-15:00. So after 15:00, Joan is free. Terry has 15:00-15:30. So during 15:00-15:30, Terry is busy. So that's out. So next possible after 15:30.\n\n15:30-16:00: Check.\n\nJoan is free.\n\nMegan: free until 16:00.\n\nBetty: free until 16:00.\n\nJudith: free (blocked 14-15, so after 15:00 free).\n\nTerry: after 15:30, he's free until 16:00 (his next is 16:00-17:00).\n\nKathryn: has meetings until 16:00 (14:00-16:00). So she's free from 16:00 onwards, except 16:30-17:00.\n\nSo 15:30-16:00: Let's check each person.\n\nJoan: free.\n\nMegan: free until 16:00.\n\nAustin: free.\n\nBetty: free until 16:00.\n\nJudith: free.\n\nTerry: free from 15:30-16:00.\n\nKathryn: is she free? Her schedule is 14:00-16:00, so until 16:00 she's busy. So 15:30-16:00 is part of her busy time. So Kathryn can't attend during 15:30-16:00. So this slot is out.\n\nNext, 16:00-16:30:\n\nMegan has a meeting here (16:00-16:30).\n\nBetty has 16:00-16:30.\n\nTerry is busy 16:00-17:00.\n\nKathryn is busy 16:00-16:30 (she has 14:00-16:00, then 16:30-17:00). So between 16:00-16:30, she's free? Wait, Kathryn's meetings are 14:00-16:00, then 16:30-17:00. So 16:00-16:30 is free for her. But Megan, Betty, Terry are busy. So this slot is out.\n\n16:30-17:00: Kathryn has a meeting here. Terry is busy until 17:00. So no.\n\nSo other possible slots: Let's check the morning again. Wait, the 11:00-11:30 slot seems viable. Let me confirm again:\n\nJoan: 11:00-11:30 free? Yes, her meetings start at 11:30.\n\nMegan: free until 14:00.\n\nAustin: free.\n\nBetty: free until 11:30.\n\nJudith: free until 12:00.\n\nTerry: free until 11:30.\n\nKathryn: free until 11:30.\n\nYes, all are available then. So the answer should be 11:00-11:30 on Monday.",
