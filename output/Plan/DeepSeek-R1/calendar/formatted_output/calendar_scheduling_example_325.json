            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 for all six people: Jose, Keith, Logan, Megan, Gary, and Bobby. Let's start by listing everyone's busy times and then look for gaps where they're all free.\n\nFirst, Jose's busy periods are 11:00-11:30 and 12:30-13:00. He also doesn't want to meet after 15:30, so any time after that is out for him.\n\nKeith has meetings at 14:00-14:30 and 15:00-15:30. So he's busy in those two half-hour blocks.\n\nLogan is busy from 9:00-10:00, 12:00-12:30, and 15:00-15:30.\n\nMegan's blocked times are 9:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-13:30, and 14:30-16:30. That's a lot of blocked time, so her available slots are probably limited.\n\nGary has a bunch of blocks: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-16:30. So his available times are in between those.\n\nBobby is busy 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, and 13:00-16:00. So after 16:00, he might be free, but Jose can't meet after 15:30. So Bobby's availability after 16:00 is irrelevant here because of Jose's constraint.\n\nNow, let's look for a 30-minute window where none of these people have conflicts. Let's start from the earliest time and move forward.\n\nStarting at 9:00:\n\n- Megan is busy until 10:30. Gary is busy until 9:30, then free until 10:00. But Megan is still busy until 10:30. So before 10:30, Megan isn't available. So earliest possible time after Megan is 10:30.\n\nFrom 10:30 to 11:00:\n\nCheck each person's schedule:\n\nJose is free here (his first meeting is at 11). Keith is free. Logan is free after 10:00 (since he's busy until 10:00). Megan is free from 10:30 (her first block ends at 10:30). Gary is free from 9:30-10:00, but then busy again at 10:00-10:30. Wait, Gary's blocked from 10:00-10:30. So at 10:30, Gary is free again? Because his next block is 11:30. So 10:30-11:00 would be free for Gary. Bobby is free until 11:00. So 10:30-11:00 looks possible. Let's check everyone:\n\nJose: Free\nKeith: Free\nLogan: Free (after 10:00, he's busy 12-12:30 next)\nMegan: Free starting at 10:30\nGary: Free from 10:30 (since his 10:00-10:30 block ends at 10:30)\nBobby: Free until 11:00\n\nSo 10:30-11:00 is a 30-minute slot. Does that work? Let me confirm each person's schedule again:\n\nJose: No meetings here. Good.\nKeith: No conflicts. Good.\nLogan: His next meeting is at 12:00. So 10:30-11:00 is free. Good.\nMegan: Her first block ends at 10:30, so 10:30-11:00 is free. But wait, Megan's blocked until 10:30. So starting at 10:30, she's free. The meeting would start at 10:30 and end at 11:00. That works because her next block starts at 11:00. So 10:30-11:00 is okay.\n\nGary: He was busy from 10:00-10:30. So after 10:30, he's free until 11:30. So yes, 10:30-11:00 is good.\n\nBobby: He's free until 11:00. So this slot works.\n\nBut wait, Jose has a meeting starting at 11:00. So the meeting from 10:30-11:00 would end right at 11:00. But Jose's meeting starts at 11:00. So that's acceptable because it doesn't overlap. So this slot seems to work.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other possible slots. Maybe after 13:00 or so.\n\nLooking at other possible times:\n\nAfter 13:00:\n\nBobby is busy from 13:00 to 16:00. So any time between 13:00 and 16:00 is out for Bobby. But Jose can't meet after 15:30, so we need to check between 13:00 and 15:30. But Bobby is busy during that time. So Bobby can't attend any meetings from 13:00 to 16:00, which makes that entire period unavailable.\n\nSo the only possible times are before 11:00 or between 16:00 and 17:00. But Jose can't meet after 15:30, so 16:00 is too late.\n\nWait, the work hours are 9:00 to 17:00, but Jose can't meet after 15:30. So the latest possible time is 15:30, but the meeting has to start by 15:00 to end at 15:30. But Bobby is busy until 16:00. So after 15:30, Jose can't meet, so we can't consider times after that.\n\nSo the only possible slot is 10:30-11:00. Let me check again.\n\nMegan's blocked until 10:30. So from 10:30 onwards, she's free until 11:00. That works. Gary is free from 10:30-11:30. Logan is free from 10:00-12:00 (except 12:00-12:30). So 10:30-11:00 is free for him. Keith has no meetings in that time. Bobby is free until 11:00. So yes, this slot works for everyone.\n\nWait, but let's check each person's schedule again to be thorough.\n\nJose: 10:30-11:00 is free. His next meeting is at 11:00, so this works.\n\nKeith: No meetings during this time.\n\nLogan: He's free from 10:00 (his first block ends at 10:00) until 12:00. So 10:30-11:00 is okay.\n\nMegan: Her calendar is blocked until 10:30. So 10:30-11:00 is free, as her next block starts at 11:00.\n\nGary: He's free from 10:30 (after his 10:00-10:30 block) until 11:30. So 10:30-11:00 is good.\n\nBobby: He's free until 11:00. His first meeting is at 11:00, so this slot ends just in time.\n\nSo yes, this time works. I don't see any conflicts here. Let's confirm there's no other possible slot. For example, between 13:00 and 15:30, but Bobby is busy. Between 12:30-13:00, Jose has a meeting. Before 10:30, Megan and Gary are busy. So the only available slot is 10:30-11:00.",
