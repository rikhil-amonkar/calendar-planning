            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. First, I need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 that works for Margaret, Donna, and Helen, considering their existing schedules and Helen's preference not to meet after 13:30.\n\nStarting with the participants' blocked times:\n\n- **Margaret's blocked periods**:\n  - 9:00-10:00\n  - 10:30-11:00\n  - 11:30-12:00\n  - 13:00-13:30\n  - 15:00-15:30\n\n- **Donna's blocked periods**:\n  - 14:30-15:00\n  - 16:00-16:30\n\n- **Helen's meetings**:\n  - 9:00-9:30\n  - 10:00-11:30\n  - 13:00-14:00\n  - 14:30-15:00\n  - 15:30-17:00\n\nHelen can't meet after 13:30, so the meeting must be scheduled before that time. Let's look at the available time slots before 13:30.\n\nFirst, check the morning hours from 9:00 onwards. Helen is busy until 9:30. Then, from 9:30 to 10:00. Let's see:\n\n- **9:30-10:00**:\n  - Margaret is free (her first block ends at 10:00, but she's blocked until 10:00. Wait, her first block is 9:00-10:00. So during 9:30-10:00, Margaret is still blocked. So that slot is out.\n\nNext, after 10:00. Margaret is free from 10:00 to 10:30, but Helen has a meeting from 10:00 to 11:30. So 10:00-10:30 is when Helen is busy. So that's not possible.\n\nThen, Margaret has a block at 10:30-11:00. During that time, Helen is still in her meeting until 11:30. So no luck there.\n\nAfter Helen's meeting ends at 11:30, she's free. But Margaret is blocked from 11:30 to 12:00. So from 11:30-12:00, Margaret is busy, so that's out.\n\nNext, check 12:00 to 13:00. Let's see:\n\n- **12:00-12:30**:\n  - Margaret is free (she's blocked until 12:00, then free until 13:00).\n  - Donna has no blocks here.\n  - Helen's next meeting starts at 13:00, so she's free from 11:30 to 13:00. Wait, Helen's schedule says 10:00-11:30, then next is 13:00-14:00. So between 11:30 and 13:00, Helen is free. So from 12:00-12:30, all three are free.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nMargaret's blocked until 12:00 (her 11:30-12:00 block). So after 12:00, she's free until 13:00. So 12:00-12:30 is free for Margaret.\n\nDonna has no blocks in this time; her first block is at 14:30.\n\nHelen is free from 11:30 to 13:00. So 12:00-12:30 is available for her.\n\nSo that's a possible slot. Let's check if there's a 30-minute window here. 12:00 to 12:30 works for all. Let me confirm:\n\n- Margaret: 12:00-13:00 free except her 11:30-12:00 block. So 12:00-13:00 is free.\n- Donna: No conflicts here.\n- Helen: Free from 11:30-13:00.\n\nSo yes, 12:00-12:30 is a valid time. Also, Helen's preference is not to meet after 13:30, which this slot satisfies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another slot? Let's check 12:30-13:00. Margaret is free until 13:00. Donna still free. Helen is free until 13:00. So 12:30-13:00 also works. But the problem states that the meeting is half an hour. Either of those times would work.\n\nBut wait, Helen's next meeting is at 13:00. So 12:30-13:00 would end right when her next meeting starts. But depending on how precise we need to be, maybe that's acceptable. But usually, meetings don't overlap. So 12:30-13:00 might be cutting it close. But the problem says the existing schedules are blocked, so perhaps Helen is busy at 13:00. So 12:30-13:00 is acceptable as the meeting ends at 13:00, which is when her next one starts. But some scheduling systems might consider that a conflict. Let's assume that the end time is exclusive. So if Helen's next meeting is at 13:00, then the slot up to 13:00 is okay. But sometimes, meetings are scheduled to end at 13:00, so a meeting from 12:30-13:00 is possible. However, perhaps the 12:00-12:30 slot is safer and more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let's check other possible times. What about between 13:30 and 14:00? Wait, Helen doesn't want to meet after 13:30, so any time after 13:30 is out. So the latest possible time is up to 13:30. So the next possible after 12:00-12:30 is 12:30-13:00. Either slot works. Both are within Helen's acceptable time.\n\nSo the available times are 12:00-12:30 and 12:30-13:00. Let's verify if there are any other constraints.\n\nLooking at Donna's schedule: she has a block starting at 14:30, so before that, she's free except for 16:00-16:30, which is later. So Donna is free all morning and early afternoon except her blocks. So both 12:00-12:30 and 12:30-13:00 work for Donna.\n\nMargaret is free from 12:00 to 13:00, except 13:00-13:30 is blocked (but that's after 13:00). So those two slots are okay.\n\nHelen is free until 13:00. So either slot works.\n\nTherefore, the earliest possible time would be 12:00-12:30. Alternatively, 12:30-13:00. Since the problem states there's a solution, either is valid. But the assistant should pick one. Let's check the original example's solution. Wait, in the problem statement, the user didn't provide the example solution, but the assistant is supposed to generate it. So perhaps the correct answer is 12:00-12:30. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, Helen's schedule shows she has a meeting from 13:00-14:00, so she needs to be there at 13:00. So a meeting ending at 13:00 might be okay, but perhaps the safest is 12:00-12:30. That's the earliest available slot where all three are free and meets Helen's preference.",
