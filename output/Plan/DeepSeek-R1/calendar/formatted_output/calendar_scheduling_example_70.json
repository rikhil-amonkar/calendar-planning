            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, Denise, Angela, and Natalie need a half-hour meeting on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The goal is to find the earliest time they're all available. Let me start by listing out everyone's busy times and then look for gaps.\n\nDenise is busy from 12:00-12:30 and 15:30-16:00. Angela has no meetings, so she's free all day. Natalie's schedule is busier: 9:00-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 14:00-14:30, and 15:00-17:00. So Natalie's available slots are between 11:30-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00. But we also need to check Denise's availability in those slots.\n\nFirst possible slot after 9:00 is 11:30-12:00. But Denise is free here except her 12:00-12:30 block. So 11:30-12:00 might work. Wait, Natalie is free from 11:30 to 12:00. Denise isn't busy until 12:00, so 11:30 to 12:00 is open for her. Angela is free. So this slot could work. But wait, the meeting needs to be half an hour. So 11:30-12:00 is exactly 30 minutes. That's a possible candidate.\n\nNext, Natalie is free from 13:00-14:00. Denise is available during that time except her 12:00-12:30 block. So from 13:00 onwards, Denise is free until 15:30. So 13:00-14:00 is open for both Denise and Natalie. Let's check the earliest time here. The earliest possible here is 13:00, but maybe there's a slot between 11:30-12:00. Let me check if that's valid. From 11:30 to 12:00, Natalie is available, Denise is available (since her block starts at 12:00), and Angela is free. So that's a valid slot. So that would be the earliest possible time.\n\nWait, but Natalie's available from 11:30 to 12:00. Denise's first block is 12:00-12:30, so up until 12:00 she's free. So 11:30-12:00 is a 30-minute window where all three are available. That seems correct. Let me double-check. Natalie's busy until 11:30, so at 11:30 she's free. Denise is free until 12:00. Angela is free. So that's the earliest possible time. Then the next slot would be 13:00-14:00, but since we need the earliest, 11:30 is better.\n\nBut wait, the problem says there exists a solution. So 11:30-12:00 is a valid slot. That should be the answer.",
