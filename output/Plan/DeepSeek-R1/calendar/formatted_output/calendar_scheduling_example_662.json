            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem for Gary and David. The meeting needs to be one hour between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday or Tuesday. Let me first list out their blocked times and see where there's an overlap of free slots.\n\nStarting with Monday. Gary's blocked periods are:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 11:00-13:00\n- 14:00-14:30\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nDavid's blocked on Monday:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-13:00\n- 14:30-16:30\n\nSo combining these, the free times on Monday would be:\n- From 9:00 to 9:30: Gary is free, but David is blocked.\n- 9:30-10:00: Gary is blocked.\n- 10:00-10:00? Wait, Gary is blocked from 9:30 to 10:00 and 11:00-13:00. So between 10:00 to 11:00, Gary is free except for 10:00-11:00? Wait, no. Wait, Gary's blocked from 9:30-10:00, then next block is 11:00-13:00. So from 10:00 to 11:00, Gary is free. But David is blocked from 10:00 to 13:00. So during 10:00-11:00, David is blocked. So that's no good.\n\nThen after 13:00 (1 PM) on Monday. Gary is blocked 11:00-13:00, so he's free starting 13:00. David is blocked until 13:00 as well. So from 13:00 to 14:00. Wait, Gary's next block is 14:00-14:30. So from 13:00 to 14:00, Gary is free. David's blocked until 13:00, then after 13:00, David's blocked again from 14:30 to 16:30. So between 13:00 and 14:00, David is free. So that's a possible window: 13:00-14:00 on Monday. But Gary is free here. Wait, but wait, Gary's next blocked time is 14:00-14:30. So 13:00 to 14:00 would be free for Gary. And David's blocked until 14:30, but from 13:00 to 14:30? Wait, David's blocked on Monday from 14:30 to 16:30, but before that, after 13:00, David's schedule is free until 14:30. So between 13:00 and 14:30, David is free except maybe I need to check again. Wait, David's Monday schedule: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-13:00, 14:30-16:30. So after 13:00, David is free from 13:00 to 14:30, right? Because the next block starts at 14:30. So from 13:00 to 14:30, David is free. Gary is free from 13:00 to 14:00 (since his next block starts at 14:00). So the overlapping free time here is 13:00-14:00. That's a one-hour window. That could work. Let me check again. Gary is free from 13:00 to 14:00, David is free from 13:00 to 14:30. So 13:00-14:00 is available for both. That's a possible slot on Monday.\n\nBut wait, let me check other possibilities. What about after 14:30? Gary's next block is 14:00-14:30. So after 14:30, Gary is free until 16:30. But David is blocked from 14:30-16:30. So on Monday, after 14:30, David is blocked, so no good.\n\nThen, let's check Tuesday. Gary's blocked times on Tuesday:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 14:30-16:00\n\nDavid's Tuesday blocked times:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 11:00-12:30\n- 13:00-14:30\n- 15:00-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nSo looking for free slots on Tuesday where both are available.\n\nStarting from 9:00. Both are blocked until 9:30. Then from 9:30 to 10:00: Gary is free (blocked until 9:30), David is free until 10:00. So 9:30-10:00 is possible, but only 30 minutes. Not enough.\n\nFrom 10:00 to 10:30: David is blocked (10:00-10:30). Gary is free until 10:30? Wait, Gary's blocked on Tuesday from 10:30-11:00. So Gary is free from 9:30 (after his 9:00-9:30 block) until 10:30. Then from 10:30-11:00 he's blocked. So on Tuesday, between 10:00-10:30, David is blocked, so that's out.\n\nThen from 10:30 to 11:00: Gary is blocked. David is blocked from 11:00-12:30. Wait, so from 10:30-11:00: Gary's blocked. David is free from 10:30 (after his 10:00-10:30 block) until 11:00. But Gary is blocked here, so no.\n\nNext, from 11:00-12:30: David is blocked. So Gary's available? Gary's blocked until 11:00 (10:30-11:00), then after 11:00, he's free until 14:30. So from 11:00 to 14:30, Gary is free except for 14:30-16:00. But David's blocked during 11:00-12:30, then 13:00-14:30. So on Tuesday, possible free times after 12:30. Let's see:\n\nFrom 12:30 to 13:00: David is blocked from 11:00-12:30 and then next block starts at 13:00. So between 12:30-13:00, David is free. Gary is free here. So that's a 30-minute window. Not enough.\n\nThen from 13:00-14:30: David is blocked. Gary is free until 14:30. So during this time, David is blocked. So no.\n\nAfter 14:30: Gary is blocked until 16:00. David's next block is 15:00-16:00, and then 16:30-17:00. So from 14:30-15:00: Gary is blocked, David is free (he's blocked from 15:00). Wait, David's blocks on Tuesday: 13:00-14:30, then 15:00-16:00. So between 14:30 and 15:00, David is free. But Gary is blocked from 14:30-16:00. So during 14:30-15:00, Gary is blocked. So that's no good.\n\nThen from 16:00-16:30: Gary is free (his block ends at 16:00). David's block ends at 16:00, but he's blocked again from 16:30. So from 16:00-16:30: Gary is free, David is free. But the meeting needs to be one hour. So 16:00-17:00 is work hours, but David is blocked from 16:30. So 16:00-16:30 is 30 minutes. Not enough.\n\nSo on Tuesday, there's no one-hour slot. The possible slots on Monday: 13:00-14:00. Let me check if that works for both.\n\nGary on Monday: 11:00-13:00 blocked, so after 13:00, free until 14:00 (blocked at 14:00). So 13:00-14:00 is free. David on Monday: blocked until 13:00, then free until 14:30. So 13:00-14:00 is free for both. That's a one-hour slot. So the answer should be Monday 13:00-14:00.\n\nWait, but the example solution in the problem statement might have a different answer, but according to my analysis, this is the correct slot. Let me verify again.\n\nGary's Monday blocked times:\n9:30-10:00\n11:00-13:00\n14:00-14:30\n16:30-17:00\n\nSo after 13:00, Gary is free until 14:00. Then blocked from 14:00-14:30.\n\nDavid's Monday blocked times:\n9:00-9:30\n10:00-13:00\n14:30-16:30\n\nAfter 13:00, David is free until 14:30. So between 13:00 and 14:00, both are free. That's a valid one-hour slot. So the answer should be Monday 13:00-14:00.",
