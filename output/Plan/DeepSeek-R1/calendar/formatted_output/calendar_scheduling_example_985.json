            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, Diane and Matthew need a one-hour meeting between 9:00 and 17:00 on any weekday. Let's look at their schedules day by day.\n\nStarting with Monday. Diane has busy times at 12:00-12:30, 15:00-15:30. Matthew is busy from 9:00-10:00 and 10:30-17:00. So the only possible slot on Monday is between 10:00-10:30. But the meeting needs an hour, so that's only 30 minutes. Not enough. So Monday's out.\n\nTuesday. Diane's schedule is packed: 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 16:00-17:00. Matthew is busy all day until 17:00. So no free time here. Tuesday is no good.\n\nWednesday. Diane's busy at 9:00-9:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00. Matthew has meetings 9:00-11:00, 12:00-14:30, 16:00-17:00. Plus, Matthew prefers not to meet before 12:30 on Wednesday. Let's check available slots. After 14:30 on Wednesday: Diane is free from 15:00-16:30 (since her next busy is 16:30). Matthew's next meeting is at 16:00. So between 14:30 and 16:00. Wait, Matthew's free from 14:30-16:00? Because his last meeting ends at 14:30. So from 14:30 to 16:00. Diane is free from 14:30-15:00 she's busy. Wait, Diane's busy on Wednesday during 14:30-15:00. So after 15:00, Diane is free until 16:30. Matthew is free from 14:30-16:00. So the overlapping time would be 15:00-16:00. That's a one-hour slot. But Matthew's next meeting is at 16:00, so ending at 16:00 is okay. But Diane is free until 16:30. So 15:00-16:00 on Wednesday? That works. But Matthew's preference is not to meet before 12:30, but this is in the afternoon, so that's okay. So Wednesday 15:00-16:00 is possible.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Diane's Wednesday schedule: 9:00-9:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00. So from 9:30-14:30, she's free except for those breaks? Wait, maybe I need to reconstruct her schedule. Wait, Diane's Wednesday: 9:00-9:30, then 14:30-15:00, and 16:30-17:00. So between 9:30 and 14:30, she's free? Let's see. Wait, no: from 9:00-9:30 busy. Then free until 14:30? Because her next busy is 14:30-15:00. So from 9:30 to 14:30, she's free. But Matthew on Wednesday has 9:00-11:00, then 12:00-14:30. So Matthew's free on Wednesday from 11:00-12:00 and after 14:30. But Diane's free from 9:30-14:30 except for the 14:30-15:00 slot. Wait, Diane's free from 9:30 to 14:30 (since her next busy is at 14:30). But Matthew's available on Wednesday from 11:00-12:00 (since he has a meeting 9-11, then 12-14:30). So 11:00-12:00 is a possible slot. But Diane is free then. Wait, Diane's Tuesday schedule has some conflicts, but on Wednesday, Diane's only busy at 9-9:30, 14:30-15:00, and 16:30-17:00. So on Wednesday, from 9:30-14:30, Diane is free. Matthew's available on Wednesday from 11:00-12:00 (between his meetings). So an hour from 11:00-12:00. But Matthew prefers not to meet before 12:30 on Wednesday. So that slot is before 12:30, so he'd rather not. So we can't use that. Then the next available slot after 14:30. Matthew is free from 14:30-16:00 (since his next meeting is at 16:00). Diane is busy from 14:30-15:00, then free until 16:30. So their overlapping free time is 15:00-16:00. That's a one-hour slot, which works. So Wednesday 15:00-16:00 is possible. That works for both, and meets Matthew's preference.\n\nThursday. Diane's busy at 15:30-16:30. Matthew is busy until 16:00. So after 16:00, Matthew is free. Diane is busy from 15:30-16:30. So after 16:30, Diane is free. But work hours end at 17:00, so from 16:30-17:00 is only 30 minutes. Not enough. On Thursday, Matthew is free from 16:00-17:00. Diane's free from 16:30-17:00. So overlapping is 16:30-17:00, which is 30 minutes. Not enough. So Thursday can't work.\n\nFriday. Diane's busy at 9:30-11:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-17:00. Matthew is busy all day. So no available slots on Friday.\n\nSo the only possible day is Wednesday from 15:00-16:00. Let me double-check:\n\nDiane's Wednesday: 9-9:30, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00. So 15:00-16:00 is free for her (after 15:00, she's free until 16:30). Matthew's Wednesday: 9-11, 12-14:30, 16:00-17:00. So he's free from 14:30-16:00. So 15:00-16:00 is within that. Also, Matthew's preference is not to meet before 12:30 on Wednesday, which this time doesn't violate. So that's the correct slot.",
