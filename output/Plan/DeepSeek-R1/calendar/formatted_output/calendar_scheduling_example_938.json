            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, I need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday to Friday for Eugene and Eric. Let me start by looking at their schedules day by day.\n\nFirst, Monday: Eugene has several busy times\u201411-12, 1:30-2, 2:30-3, 4-4:30. But Eric is busy all day on Monday, from 9 to 5. So Monday is out.\n\nNext, Tuesday: Eugene's schedule isn't mentioned for Tuesday, which I guess means he's free except between 9-5? Wait, no, the problem says work hours are 9-5, and the existing schedules are listed per day. Since Eugene's Tuesday isn't listed, he has no conflicts. But Eric is busy all day Tuesday too. So Tuesday is no good.\n\nWednesday: Eric wants to avoid more meetings if possible, but let's check anyway. Eugene is busy on Wednesday at 9-9:30, 11-11:30, 12-12:30, 1:30-3. Eric's busy on Wednesday from 9-11:30, 12-2, 2:30-4:30. So their available times on Wednesday would be after 4:30? Because Eric's last block ends at 4:30. But work hours end at 5. So from 4:30 to 5, there's 30 minutes. But Eugene's last busy time on Wednesday is 1:30-3, so after that, he's free until 5. So 4:30-5 is available for both. But Eric prefers to avoid Wednesday. Maybe there's another day.\n\nThursday: Eugene has 9:30-10, 11-12:30. Eric is busy all day Thursday. So Thursday is out.\n\nFriday: Eugene has 10:30-11, 12-12:30, 1-1:30. Eric is busy from 9-11 and 11:30-5. So looking at Friday. Let's see the gaps. Between 11:00 and 11:30, Eric is free. But Eugene is free during that time? Let's check Eugene's Friday schedule. He has 10:30-11:00 busy, so after 11 he's free until 12:00. So 11:00-11:30 would work for Eugene. But Eric is free from 11:00 to 11:30 on Friday. So that's a 30-minute slot. That seems possible. Let me confirm: Eugene is busy Friday 10:30-11:00, then next at 12:00. So from 11-12, he's free except 12-12:30. So 11:00-11:30 would work. Eric is free 11-11:30 on Friday. So that's a valid slot. Also, Eric prefers avoiding Wednesday, so Friday is better. That seems like the answer.",
