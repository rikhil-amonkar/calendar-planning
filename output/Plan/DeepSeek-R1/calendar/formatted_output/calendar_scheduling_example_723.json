            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, Arthur and Michael need a 30-minute meeting between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. But Arthur can't meet on Tuesday. The earliest available time is preferred. Let's start by looking at each day they can meet: Monday, Wednesday. Tuesday is out because Arthur can't meet then.\n\nFirst, let's check Monday. Both are available from 9-17, but need to check their existing meetings.\n\nArthur's Monday schedule:\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 13:30-14:00\n- 15:00-15:30\nSo his free periods on Monday are:\n9:00-11:00, 11:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00.\n\nMichael's Monday meetings:\n- 9:00-12:00\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 14:00-14:30\n- 15:00-17:00\nSo Michael's free times on Monday:\nAfter 12:00-12:30 (but he has 12:30-13:00 meeting), then 13:00-14:00? Wait, his schedule says 12:30-13:00 and 14:00-14:30. So between 13:00-14:00? Wait, his first block is 9-12, then 12:30-13:00. So between 12:00-12:30 he's free? Wait, no. Wait, the first meeting is 9-12, so after that, he's free from 12:00 to 12:30? Because the next meeting is 12:30-13:00. Then from 13:00 to 14:00, because after 13:00 meeting ends at 13:00, then next is 14:00. Wait, no. Let me re-express Michael's Monday schedule:\n\nMichael's Monday:\n- 9:00-12:00 (busy)\n- 12:30-13:00 (busy)\n- 14:00-14:30 (busy)\n- 15:00-17:00 (busy)\n\nSo his free time on Monday is:\n\nFrom 12:00-12:30 (between 12:00 end of first meeting and start of next at 12:30)\nFrom 13:00-14:00 (after 13:00 meeting ends and before 14:00)\nFrom 14:30-15:00 (after 14:30 meeting ends and before 15:00 starts)\nBut Arthur's free on Monday in the slots I mentioned earlier. Let's see where they overlap.\n\nArthur's Monday free times:\n1. 9:00-11:00 \u2192 but Michael is busy until 12:00.\n2. 11:30-13:30 \u2192 Michael's available 12:00-12:30 and 13:00-14:00. So overlapping here would be:\n\nArthur's 11:30-13:30 includes 12:00-12:30 (Michael's available) and 13:00-13:30 (Arthur is free until 13:30, Michael is free 13:00-14:00). So possible slots:\n\n- 12:00-12:30: Michael is free here. Arthur is free from 11:30-13:30, so 12:00-12:30 works. So a 30-minute slot here.\n\nBut wait, Arthur's meetings on Monday are 11-11:30, then next is 13:30-14:00. Wait, Arthur's schedule: on Monday, 11:00-11:30, then 13:30-14:00. So between 11:30 to 13:30, he's free. So that's 11:30 to 13:30. Michael's available 12:00-12:30 and 13:00-14:00. So overlapping times between them would be:\n\n12:00-12:30 (both free), and 13:00-13:30 (Arthur is free until 13:30, Michael is free from 13:00-14:00). So two possible slots.\n\nThe earliest possible on Monday would be 12:00-12:30. But wait, Arthur's next meeting after 11:30 is at 13:30. So Arthur is free from 11:30 to 13:30. Michael's first available slot on Monday after 9:00 is 12:00-12:30. So 12:00-12:30 is a possible 30-minute slot. Let's check if that works. Yes, both are free.\n\nNow check Wednesday. Let's see.\n\nArthur's Wednesday meetings:\n10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 14:00-14:30, 16:00-16:30. So his free times are:\n\n9:00-10:00\n10:30-11:00\n11:30-12:00\n12:30-14:00\n14:30-16:00\n16:30-17:00\n\nMichael's Wednesday meetings:\n10:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30. So his free times on Wednesday are:\n\n9:00-10:00\n12:30-13:00\n13:30-17:00 (but check specifics: after 13:30 meeting ends at 13:30, he's free until 17:00? Yes.)\n\nSo overlapping on Wednesday:\n\nPossible overlaps:\n\nArthur's free times and Michael's free times.\n\nArthur's 9-10, Michael's 9-10: yes. So 9:00-10:00. But Arthur's earliest availability here. Let's check if they can meet here. Both are free. So 9:00-9:30 would be a possible slot.\n\nAnother possible slot: 12:30-14:00 for Arthur, and Michael's 12:30-13:00. So overlapping 12:30-13:00. So 30 minutes here.\n\nBut Michael is free from 12:30-13:00. Arthur is free from 12:30-14:00. So 12:30-13:00 is a possible slot. Then also, after 13:30, Michael is free. Arthur is free from 12:30-14:00 (so until 14:00). So from 13:30-14:00, Arthur is free (since his next meeting is at 14:00), but Michael is free from 13:30 onwards. So 13:30-14:00 is another possible slot. Also, after 14:30 for Arthur, he's free until 16:00. Michael is free after 13:30. So 14:30-16:00 for Arthur and Michael's 13:30-17:00. So overlapping here. For example, 14:30-15:00. But the earliest possible on Wednesday is 9:00-9:30.\n\nNow, comparing the earliest options between Monday and Wednesday. On Monday, the earliest slot is 12:00-12:30. On Wednesday, the earliest is 9:00-9:30. Since the group wants the earliest availability, Wednesday 9:00 is earlier than Monday 12:00.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Are both Arthur and Michael free at 9:00 on Wednesday?\n\nArthur's Wednesday meetings start at 10:00. So he's free from 9:00-10:00. Michael's Wednesday meetings start at 10:00. So he's free from 9:00-10:00. So yes, both are free from 9:00-10:00. So a 30-minute meeting could be 9:00-9:30. That's the earliest possible on Wednesday. But wait, the work hours are between 9:00 to 17:00, so starting at 9:00 is allowed.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00\". So the meeting can start at 9:00 as long as it ends by 17:00. So 9:00-9:30 is acceptable.\n\nSo the earliest possible time is Wednesday 9:00-9:30. But wait, are there any constraints I missed? The problem says \"Arthur can not meet on Tuesday.\" Which is already handled. So the earliest possible is Wednesday at 9:00-9:30.\n\nBut let me check again. Let's confirm that on Wednesday, both are free at 9:00-10:00. Arthur has no meetings then. Michael's Wednesday starts with 10:00-12:30. So yes, 9:00-10:00 is free. So 9:00-9:30 would work. That's the earliest possible time.\n\nBut wait, the assistant said to make sure the solution works. So let's check again.\n\nArthur's Wednesday: 10:00-10:30, etc. So before 10:00, he's free.\n\nMichael's Wednesday: 10:00-12:30. So before 10:00, he's free.\n\nSo 9:00-9:30 is available for both. That's the earliest possible time. So the answer should be Wednesday 9:00-9:30.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the solution might be different. Let me recheck the existing schedules.\n\nWait, the existing schedules are as follows:\n\nArthur's Wednesday meetings: 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 14:00-14:30, 16:00-16:30. So his free times on Wednesday are:\n\nFrom 9:00-10:00.\n\nThen between 10:30-11:00.\n\nThen 11:30-12:00.\n\nThen 12:30-14:00.\n\nThen 14:30-16:00.\n\nThen 16:30-17:00.\n\nMichael's Wednesday meetings: 10:00-12:30 and 13:00-13:30. So his free times are:\n\n9:00-10:00.\n\nThen after 12:30, but his next meeting is 13:00-13:30. So 12:30-13:00 is free, then 13:30 onwards is free.\n\nSo overlapping between Arthur and Michael on Wednesday:\n\n9:00-10:00 (both free).\n\n12:30-13:00 (Arthur is free until 14:00; Michael is free 12:30-13:00).\n\n13:30-14:00 (Arthur free until 14:00, Michael free from 13:30).\n\n14:30-16:00 (Arthur free, Michael free from 13:30 onwards).\n\nSo the earliest possible is 9:00-9:30 on Wednesday. That's the earliest possible time that fits both schedules.\n\nBut let's check Monday again. The earliest possible on Monday is 12:00-12:30. But since Wednesday's 9:00 is earlier, that's the preferred time as per the group's preference for earliest availability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Wednesday at 9:00-9:30.",
