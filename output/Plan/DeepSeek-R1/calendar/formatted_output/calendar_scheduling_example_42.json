Let me look at their schedules step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's busy times:\n\n**Julie's Busy Times:**\n- 9:00\u20139:30\n- 11:00\u201311:30\n- 12:00\u201312:30\n- 13:30\u201314:00\n- 16:00\u201317:00\n\n**Sean's Busy Times:**\n- 9:00\u20139:30\n- 13:00\u201313:30\n- 15:00\u201315:30\n- 16:00\u201316:30\n\n**Lori's Busy Times:**\n- 10:00\u201310:30\n- 11:00\u201313:00\n- 15:30\u201317:00\n\nWe need to find a 1-hour window where none of them have any conflicts. Let's break down the available time slots.\n\nStarting from 9:00. Julie and Sean are both busy until 9:30. Lori is free until 10:00. So next possible slot after 9:30. Let's check 9:30\u201310:00. Wait, but the meeting needs to be an hour. So starting at 9:30 would end at 10:30. But Lori has 10:00\u201310:30 blocked. So the slot 9:30\u201310:30 would overlap with Lori's 10:00\u201310:30. So that doesn't work.\n\nNext, looking at after 10:30. Lori is free from 10:30 to 11:00. Julie is free from 9:30 to 11:00, except her 11:00\u201311:30. Wait, Julie's next busy time after 9:30 is 11:00\u201311:30. So from 10:30 to 11:00, Julie is free. Sean's next meeting after 9:30 is at 13:00. So Sean is free from 9:30 until 13:00, except maybe other blocks? Let me check again. Sean's schedule: 9:00\u20139:30, then next is 13:00\u201313:30. So between 9:30 and 13:00, Sean is free. Lori is free from 10:30 to 11:00. So the only possible slot here is 10:30\u201311:00, but that's only 30 minutes. We need an hour. So that's not enough.\n\nAfter Lori's 10:30\u201311:00 free time, she's busy again from 11:00 to 13:00. So during 11:00\u201313:00, Lori is busy. Julie is busy from 11:00\u201311:30, 12:00\u201312:30, and 13:30\u201314:00. So between 11:30\u201312:00, Julie is free. But Lori is still busy until 13:00. So that's a no-go.\n\nSean is free from 9:30 to 13:00. Julie has some breaks in there. Let's see when both Julie and Sean are free. For example, after 13:00. Wait, Sean has a meeting at 13:00\u201313:30. Julie's next busy time is 13:30\u201314:00. So after 13:30, Julie is free until 14:00. But Lori is busy until 13:00. Then Lori is free from 13:00 to 15:30? Wait, Lori's schedule says she's busy 11:00\u201313:00 and 15:30\u201317:00. So from 13:00 to 15:30, Lori is free. Let's check that time frame.\n\nLooking between 13:00 and 15:30.\n\nSean is busy from 13:00\u201313:30. So after 13:30, Sean is free until 15:00. His next meeting is 15:00\u201315:30. Then free until 16:00. Let's see:\n\nFrom 13:30 to 14:00: Julie is busy until 14:00. So she's free starting at 14:00. Wait, Julie's schedule says 13:30\u201314:00 is busy. So she's free after 14:00. So let's check after 14:00.\n\nAt 14:00, Julie is free. Lori is free until 15:30. Sean is free from 13:30 (after his 13:00\u201313:30 meeting) until 15:00. Wait, Sean's next meeting is 15:00\u201315:30. So between 13:30 and 15:00, Sean is free.\n\nSo possible slots:\n\n14:00\u201315:00. Let's check everyone's availability.\n\nJulie: Free from 14:00 until 16:00 (her next busy is 16:00\u201317:00). So 14:00\u201315:00 is good for her.\n\nSean: He's free until 15:00. So 14:00\u201315:00 is okay.\n\nLori: She's free until 15:30. So this works.\n\nWait, but Lori's free until 15:30, so 14:00\u201315:00 is within her available time.\n\nSo that's a possible slot. But wait, is there any other conflict?\n\nJulie is free from 14:00 onwards except 16:00\u201317:00. Sean is free from 13:30 to 15:00. Lori is free from 13:00 to 15:30.\n\nSo 14:00\u201315:00 works for all. Let me confirm:\n\nJulie: 14:00\u201315:00 is free (her blocked times are 13:30\u201314:00, so after 14:00 she's free).\n\nSean: 14:00\u201315:00 is in his free time (he's free from 13:30 to 15:00).\n\nLori: 14:00\u201315:00 is within her free time (13:00\u201315:30).\n\nYes, that seems to work. Let me check other possible slots.\n\nAnother possibility: 15:00\u201316:00.\n\nBut Sean has a meeting from 15:00\u201315:30. So 15:00\u201315:30 is busy for him. Then he's free until 16:00. Lori is free until 15:30. So if the meeting is 15:30\u201316:30, but Lori is busy from 15:30 onwards. So that's no good.\n\nAnother slot: 15:30\u201316:30. Lori is busy. So that's out.\n\nEarlier slots: between 9:30\u201310:30. As discussed, Lori is busy 10:00\u201310:30. So that slot would conflict.\n\nAnother possible slot: 12:30\u201313:30. Let's check.\n\nJulie is busy until 12:30 (her 12:00\u201312:30 block). So she's free from 12:30. But then she has another block at 13:30\u201314:00. So 12:30\u201313:30 would be possible for her. But Lori is busy until 13:00. So in that slot, Lori would be busy until 13:00, so 12:30\u201313:30 overlaps with Lori's 11:00\u201313:00. So that's a conflict.\n\nAnother possible time: 13:30\u201314:30. Julie is busy until 14:00. So 13:30\u201314:30 would overlap with her 13:30\u201314:00 block. So no.\n\nSo the only valid slot seems to be 14:00\u201315:00. Let me check again for all three:\n\n- Julie: 14:00\u201315:00 is free (her next block is 16:00)\n- Sean: 14:00\u201315:00 is free (his next meeting is 15:00)\n- Lori: 14:00\u201315:00 is free (her next block starts at 15:30)\n\nYes, that works. So the answer should be Monday, 14:00\u201315:00.",
