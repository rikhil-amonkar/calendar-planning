            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Ronald, Stephen, Brittany, Dorothy, Rebecca, and Jordan. Let's go through each person's blocked times and see where there's an overlap-free window.\n\nFirst, Ronald is free all day, so no issues there. Stephen has blocked 10:00-10:30 and 12:00-12:30. Brittany's busy at 11:00-11:30, 13:30-14:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. Dorothy's schedule is pretty packed: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-12:30, 13:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00. Rebecca has meetings from 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, and 13:00-17:00. Jordan is busy at 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 15:30-16:30.\n\nLet's list out all the blocked times and look for gaps. Let's break down the day into possible intervals where none of them have a conflict.\n\nStarting from 9:00. Dorothy is busy until 9:30, Rebecca until 10:30, Jordan until 9:30. So earliest possible after 9:30? But Rebecca is busy until 10:30. So 9:30-10:00: Dorothy is free, Ronald is free, Stephen is free except 10:00-10:30. But Rebecca is busy until 10:30, so this slot isn't possible. Next, 10:30-11:00. Let's check:\n\nStephen is free (his blocks are 10-10:30 and 12-12:30). Brittany is free until 11:00. Dorothy's next block starts at 11:00. Rebecca is free after 10:30 until 11:00 (her next meeting is 11:00). Jordan is free from 9:30-10:00, but from 10:00-11:00 he's busy. Wait, Jordan is busy 10:00-11:00. So 10:30-11:00: Jordan is still busy until 11:00. So that's out.\n\nNext, 11:00-11:30: Brittany, Dorothy, Rebecca, Jordan are all busy here. So no.\n\nAfter 11:30? Let's check. Dorothy is busy until 12:30. Rebecca has a block until 12:30. Stephen has a block at 12:00-12:30. Jordan's next free is after 12:00 (he's busy 11:30-12:00). So 12:30-13:00? Let's see. Stephen is free after 12:30. Dorothy's next block is 13:00-15:00. Rebecca is busy until 13:00. So 12:30-13:00: Dorothy is free until 13:00, but Rebecca is busy until 13:00. So Rebecca can't make that. So that's out.\n\nNext, looking at 15:00-15:30. Dorothy is free from 15:00-15:30 (her blocks are 13-15 and 15:30-17). Rebecca is busy until 17:00. Wait, Rebecca's blocked from 13:00-17:00. So any time after 13:00 is out for her. Wait, that's a problem. Because Rebecca can't attend any meeting after 13:00. So we need to find a time before 13:00 when she's free. Let me check her schedule again. Rebecca's schedule: 9:30-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-17:00. So her available times are: before 9:30 (but work hours start at 9), 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00. But she needs a 30-minute slot. So possible slots for Rebecca are 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00. However, since Rebecca can't do anything after 13:00, the meeting must be in one of those slots. Let's check each of Rebecca's available slots to see if others are free.\n\nFirst slot: 10:30-11:00. Let's check everyone else here. Stephen is free (blocked 10-10:30 and 12-12:30). Brittany is free until 11:00 (she's blocked at 11-11:30). Dorothy is blocked from 10-10:30 and 11-12:30. So at 10:30-11:00, Dorothy is blocked from 10:00-10:30, but 10:30-11:00, she's free until 11:00? Wait, Dorothy's blocked at 10:00-10:30, then next block starts at 11:00. So between 10:30-11:00, she's free. Jordan is busy from 10:00-11:00. So during 10:30-11:00, Jordan is still busy. So this slot is out because Jordan can't make it.\n\nNext Rebecca's slot: 11:30-12:00. Let's check others. Stephen is free (only blocked 10-10:30 and 12-12:30). Brittany is free from 11:30-12:00 (her blocks are 11-11:30 and next is 13:30). Dorothy is blocked from 11:00-12:30. So Dorothy is busy here. So Dorothy can't attend. So that's out.\n\nNext Rebecca's slot: 12:30-13:00. Let's check. Stephen is blocked 12:00-12:30, so free after 12:30. Brittany is free until 13:30. Dorothy's next block is 13:00-15:00. So from 12:30-13:00, Dorothy is free until 13:00. Rebecca is free here. Jordan is free after 12:00 (his blocks are 11:30-12:00, then next is 13:00). So from 12:30-13:00, Jordan is free. So let's see:\n\nAvailable participants during 12:30-13:00:\n\n- Ronald: free\n- Stephen: free after 12:30\n- Brittany: free (blocked next at 13:30)\n- Dorothy: free until 13:00\n- Rebecca: free\n- Jordan: free until 13:00\n\nSo this slot works. Let's check for 30 minutes. The slot would be 12:30-13:00. Wait, but Dorothy's next block starts at 13:00. So 12:30-13:00 is okay. All participants are available here. Let me double-check each person:\n\nRonald: yes.\n\nStephen: blocked until 12:30, so from 12:30 available. So 12:30-13:00 is good.\n\nBrittany: no conflicts here. Her next is 13:30.\n\nDorothy: free until 13:00. So 12:30-13:00 is okay.\n\nRebecca: yes.\n\nJordan: free until 13:00. Yes.\n\nSo this seems like the only possible slot. Let me confirm there's no other options. For example, between 15:00-15:30. But Rebecca is blocked all afternoon. So no. Any other time? Let's check the initial analysis again. Rebecca can't attend after 13:00, so the only possible slot is 12:30-13:00. Let's check again.\n\nYes, this seems to be the only time that works for everyone.",
