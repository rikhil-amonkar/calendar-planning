            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. First, I need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Katherine, Rebecca, Julie, Angela, Nicholas, and Carl. Angela prefers no meetings before 15:00, so ideally we should look after 15:00 if possible. But let's check all possibilities step by step.\n\nLet me list out each person's busy times and then look for gaps where all are free, especially after 15:00 for Angela's preference.\n\nStarting with the participants:\n\n1. **Katherine**:\n   - Busy: 12:00-12:30, 13:00-14:30\n   - Free times: Before 12:00, 12:30-13:00, after 14:30 until 17:00.\n\n2. **Rebecca**: No meetings. Entire day free.\n\n3. **Julie**:\n   - Busy: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30\n   - Free times: 9:30-10:30, 11:00-13:30 (but wait, 10:30-11:00 she's busy, so maybe 11:00-13:30 except 13:30-14:00? Hmm. Wait, her busy times are 9-9:30, 10:30-11, 13:30-14, 15-15:30. So free slots: 9:30-10:30, 11:00-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00.\n\n4. **Angela**:\n   - Busy: 9-10, 10:30-11, 11:30-14, 14:30-15, 16:30-17\n   - Free times: 10-10:30, 11-11:30, 14-14:30, 15-16:30\n   - But Angela prefers to avoid before 15:00. So we should prioritize her free slots after 15:00, which are 15:00-16:30. However, Angela's busy until 14:00, then has a meeting 14:30-15:00. Wait, let's recheck. Her schedule:\n     9-10, 10:30-11, 11:30-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00. So after 15:00, she's free from 15:00 to 16:30 (since her next meeting is at 16:30). But she's busy 14:30-15:00. So her available after 15:00 is 15:00-16:30.\n\n5. **Nicholas**:\n   - Busy: 9:30-11:00, 11:30-13:30, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n   - Free times: 9:00-9:30, 11:00-11:30, 13:30-14:00, 16:00-16:30.\n\n6. **Carl**:\n   - Busy: 9-11, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-14:30, 15-16, 16:30-17\n   - Free times: 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30.\n\nAngela's preference is after 15:00, so let's focus on 15:00-17:00 first.\n\nLooking at each person's availability after 15:00:\n\n- **Katherine**: Free from 14:30 onward. So 15:00 onwards is okay.\n- **Rebecca**: Always free.\n- **Julie**: After 15:30, since she's busy 15-15:30. So 15:30-17:00.\n- **Angela**: 15:00-16:30 (but she's free from 15:00 to 16:30).\n- **Nicholas**: Free from 16:00-16:30 (since he's busy until 16:00 and then 16:30-17:00).\n- **Carl**: Free from 16:00-16:30 (busy 15-16, then 16:30-17:00).\n\nSo possible slots after 15:00:\n\nFirst, 15:00-15:30: Julie is busy until 15:30. So earliest possible is 15:30. Let's check from 15:30.\n\nAt 15:30-16:00:\n\n- Katherine: Free.\n- Rebecca: Free.\n- Julie: Free (her last meeting ends at 15:30).\n- Angela: Free until 16:30.\n- Nicholas: Busy until 16:00. So from 16:00 onwards, he's free until 16:30.\n- Carl: Busy until 16:00, so 16:00-16:30 free.\n\nSo between 16:00-16:30, Nicholas and Carl are free. But Julie is free from 15:30 onwards. Angela is free until 16:30. So 16:00-16:30 is a possible window. But let's see if that works for everyone:\n\nCheck 16:00-16:30:\n\n- Katherine: Free (yes).\n- Rebecca: Free.\n- Julie: Free (15:30 onwards).\n- Angela: Free (until 16:30).\n- Nicholas: Free from 16:00-16:30.\n- Carl: Free 16:00-16:30.\n\nSo this 30-minute slot from 16:00-16:30 works for everyone. But wait, Angela's next meeting is at 16:30, so 16:00-16:30 is okay. Let's confirm all their schedules.\n\nAnother possible slot is 15:30-16:00, but Nicholas is busy until 16:00, so that slot is not available. So the next available is 16:00-16:30.\n\nAlternatively, check if there's a slot before 15:00. Angela prefers to avoid before 15:00, but if necessary, maybe there's a time. Let's check.\n\nLooking at the free times before 15:00:\n\nLet's check possible overlaps. For example, after 14:30:\n\nKatherine is free after 14:30.\n\nJulie is free from 14:00-15:00 (since she's busy 13:30-14:00, then free until 15:00).\n\nAngela is free from 14:00-14:30 (since she has 11:30-14:00, then 14:30-15:00). So Angela is free 14:00-14:30.\n\nNicholas is free 13:30-14:00 and 16:00-16:30.\n\nCarl is free 14:30-15:00 (since he's busy 13:00-14:30).\n\nSo between 14:30-15:00:\n\nKatherine is free.\n\nRebecca is free.\n\nJulie is free (14:00-15:00, except 15:00-15:30? Wait, Julie's schedule: she's busy 15:00-15:30. So from 14:00-15:00, she's free except 13:30-14:00. Wait, her busy times are 13:30-14:00. So from 14:00-15:00, she's free. So 14:30-15:00 is free for Julie.\n\nAngela is busy 14:30-15:00. So she can't attend any meeting during 14:30-15:00. Therefore, that slot is out.\n\nAnother possible time is 14:00-14:30. Let's check:\n\nKatherine is free (her busy until 14:30 ends at 14:30? Wait, Katherine's busy until 14:30. So from 14:30 onwards. So 14:00-14:30: she's busy (13:00-14:30). So she's busy until 14:30. Therefore, 14:00-14:30 she's still in a meeting. So that's not available.\n\nHow about 12:30-13:00 for Katherine. Let's see:\n\nKatherine is free 12:30-13:00.\n\nBut others:\n\nAngela is busy until 14:00 (11:30-14:00), so she can't attend before 14:00 except 11-11:30 and 10-10:30.\n\nBut Angela prefers to avoid before 15:00. So even if there's a slot before, we should prioritize after 15:00.\n\nSo the best option seems to be 16:00-16:30. Let's confirm each person's schedule:\n\n- Katherine: Free after 14:30. 16:00-16:30 is okay.\n- Rebecca: Always free.\n- Julie: After 15:30, she's free. 16:00-16:30 is okay.\n- Angela: Free until 16:30. Yes.\n- Nicholas: Free 16:00-16:30.\n- Carl: Free 16:00-16:30.\n\nAll are available. Angela's preference is met as it's after 15:00. The meeting is 30 minutes. So the answer should be 16:00-16:30 on Monday.",
