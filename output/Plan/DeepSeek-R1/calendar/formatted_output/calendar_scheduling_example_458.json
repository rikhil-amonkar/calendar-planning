            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best time to schedule this meeting. So, we need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Wayne, Melissa, Catherine, Gregory, Victoria, Thomas, and Jennifer. Plus, Wayne prefers not to have meetings before 14:00. Let's break down each person's schedule and see where there's overlap.\n\nFirst, Wayne is free all day but wants to avoid before 14:00. So possible times for him are from 14:00 onwards.\n\nMelissa's busy times: 10:00-11:00, 12:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30. So after 14:00, she's free until 15:00, then again after 15:30.\n\nCatherine is free all day, so no conflicts there.\n\nGregory's blocked times: 12:30-13:00 and 15:30-16:00. So after 14:00, he's busy at 15:30-16:00, so he's free from 14:00 to 15:30, except for 15:30-16:00.\n\nVictoria's busy times: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:30. After 14:00, she's busy from 14:30-15:00 and 15:30-16:30. So her available times after 14:00 are 14:00-14:30 and 15:00-15:30, then after 16:30.\n\nThomas's meetings: 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-16:00. After 14:00, he's busy from 14:30-16:00. So he's free from 14:00-14:30 and after 16:00.\n\nJennifer's blocked times: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-13:00, 13:30-14:30, 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30. After 14:00, she's busy 13:30-14:30 (so until 14:30), then 15:00-15:30, 16:00-16:30. So she's free from 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and after 16:30.\n\nNow, let's look for a 30-minute slot after 14:00 where everyone is free.\n\nStarting from 14:00:\n\n- 14:00-14:30: Check each person.\n\nWayne: Okay (after 14:00). Melissa: Free from 14:00 onward until 15:00 (her next meeting is 15:00-15:30). Catherine: Free. Gregory: Free. Victoria: She's free from 14:00-14:30. Thomas: He's free until 14:30. Jennifer: She's busy until 14:30. So Jennifer can't do 14:00-14:30. So that's out.\n\nNext slot: 14:30-15:00.\n\nCheck each person:\n\nMelissa: Free until 15:00. Gregory: Free. Victoria: Busy 14:30-15:00. So Victoria can't. So that's out.\n\nNext slot: 15:00-15:30.\n\nMelissa has a meeting here (15:00-15:30). So she's busy. So can't do this time.\n\nNext slot: 15:30-16:00.\n\nGregory is busy from 15:30-16:00. Victoria is busy 15:30-16:30. Thomas is busy until 16:00. Jennifer is free from 15:30-16:00. So Gregory and Victoria can't make this. Not possible.\n\nNext slot: 16:00-16:30.\n\nJennifer is busy here (16:00-16:30). Victoria is busy until 16:30. Thomas is free after 16:00. So 16:00-16:30: Jennifer is busy. So that's out.\n\nNext slot: 16:30-17:00.\n\nCheck:\n\nMelissa: Free (her last meeting ends at 15:30). Gregory: After 16:00, he's free except 15:30-16:00. So 16:30-17:00 is free. Victoria: Busy until 16:30. So after 16:30, she's free. Thomas: Free after 16:00. Jennifer: Free after 16:30. So from 16:30-17:00, everyone is free. But the meeting duration is 30 minutes. So 16:30-17:00 would work. Let me check each person:\n\nWayne: Free. Melissa: Free. Catherine: Free. Gregory: Free. Victoria: Free after 16:30. Thomas: Free. Jennifer: Free after 16:30. So yes, 16:30-17:00 works. But wait, the meeting only needs to be 30 minutes. So 16:30-17:00 is okay.\n\nWait, but what about earlier times? Let me check again to see if there's another possible slot.\n\nWait, between 14:00-14:30, Jennifer is busy until 14:30. So she can't do 14:00-14:30. What about 14:00-14:30 for others except Jennifer? No, Jennifer is part of the meeting. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother possible time: Maybe between 14:00-14:30, but Jennifer is busy until 14:30. So she can't.\n\nHow about 14:00-14:30? No. Jennifer is busy until 14:30. So next possible is 16:30-17:00.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let's check again.\n\nWait, Victoria's schedule after 14:00:\n\nShe's busy 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:30. So from 15:00-15:30, she's free? Wait, let me check the original data again. Victoria's busy times: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:30. So after 14:00, her busy times are 14:30-15:00 and 15:30-16:30. So between 15:00-15:30, she's free. \n\nWait, that's a possible slot. Let's check 15:00-15:30.\n\nMelissa has a meeting from 15:00-15:30. So she can't attend. So that's out.\n\nWhat about 15:30-16:00? Gregory is busy (15:30-16:00). Victoria is busy from 15:30-16:30. So she can't. So that's not possible.\n\nHow about 15:00-15:30: Only Melissa is busy. So no. \n\nAnother possible time: Let's look between 14:00 and 14:30. But Jennifer is busy until 14:30. So the earliest time Jennifer is available after 14:00 is 14:30. Let's check 14:30-15:00.\n\nAt 14:30-15:00:\n\nVictoria is busy (14:30-15:00). So she can't. So that's out.\n\nHmm. So the only available time when everyone is free is 16:30-17:00. Let me confirm each person's availability at that time:\n\nWayne: Free. \n\nMelissa: No meetings after 15:30. So 16:30-17:00 is free.\n\nCatherine: Free.\n\nGregory: His last blocked time is 15:30-16:00. So after 16:00, he's free. So 16:30-17:00 is okay.\n\nVictoria: Busy until 16:30. So 16:30-17:00 is free.\n\nThomas: His last meeting ends at 16:00. So 16:00 onward is free. So 16:30-17:00 is okay.\n\nJennifer: Her last blocked time is 16:00-16:30. So after 16:30, she's free. \n\nYes, so all are available from 16:30-17:00. That's a 30-minute slot. So the answer should be Monday, 16:30-17:00.",
