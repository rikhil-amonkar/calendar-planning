            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, the goal is to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where Diane, Jack, Eugene, and Patricia are all available. Let's start by listing out everyone's blocked times and then look for gaps where all four are free.\n\nFirst, Diane's blocked times on Monday are 9:30-10:00 and 14:30-15:00. So she's busy during those half-hour blocks.\n\nJack has blocks at 13:30-14:00 and 14:30-15:00. So similar to Diane in the afternoon, but also a bit earlier.\n\nEugene's schedule is more packed. He's blocked from 9-10, 10:30-11:30, 12-14:30, and 15-16:30. That leaves him with 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, and then after 16:30 until 17:00. Wait, but the meeting needs to end by 17:00, so the latest possible start would be 16:30 for a 30-minute meeting. But Eugene is blocked until 16:30. So his available slots are 10-10:30, 11:30-12, and 16:30-17:00. But wait, 16:30-17:00 would be a possible slot, but let's check others.\n\nPatricia's blocked times are 9:30-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 12:30-14:00, and 15:00-16:30. So her available times would be 9:00-9:30 (but the work hours start at 9:00, so maybe 9:00-9:30?), then 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 14:00-15:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nNow, let's look for overlapping free times.\n\nFirst, check the morning. Let's see:\n\n- 9:00-9:30: Patricia is free here (since her first block starts at 9:30). But Diane is available from 9:00 until her block at 9:30. So from 9:00-9:30, Diane is free. Jack's schedule doesn't mention any blocks in the morning, so he's free here. Eugene is blocked from 9-10, so he can't attend. So this slot is out because Eugene is busy.\n\nNext, 10:00-10:30: Diane is blocked until 10:00 (since her block is 9:30-10:00). So after 10:00, Diane is free until her next block. Wait, Diane's block is 9:30-10:00, so she's free from 10:00 onwards. Eugene has 10:00-10:30 available. Patricia is blocked from 9:30-10:30, so she can't attend. So this slot is out due to Patricia's conflict.\n\n10:30-11:00: Patricia is free here. Diane is free (since her next block is 14:30). Jack is free (no blocks mentioned here). Eugene is blocked from 10:30-11:30. So Eugene can't make it here. So this slot is out.\n\n11:00-11:30: Patricia is blocked (11:00-12:00). Jack is free. Diane is free. Eugene is blocked (10:30-11:30). So no good.\n\n11:30-12:00: Eugene is free here (11:30-12:00). Patricia is free from 12:00-12:30, but between 11:30-12:00, Patricia is blocked until 12:00. Wait, Patricia's block is 11:00-12:00. So she's busy until 12:00. So this slot is 11:30-12:00, but Patricia is still blocked. So no.\n\n12:00-12:30: Patricia is free here (12:00-12:30). Diane is free. Jack is free. Eugene is free from 12:00-12:00? Wait, Eugene's blocked until 12:00. Wait, Eugene's blocked from 12:00 to 14:30. Wait, no: Eugene's blocked from 12:00 to 14:30. So from 12:00 onward, he's busy. So 12:00-12:30, Eugene is blocked. So that's out.\n\nThen, looking at the afternoon. Let's check 14:00-14:30. Patricia is free from 14:00-15:00, except her block from 15:00. Wait, Patricia's blocks are 12:30-14:00, so after 14:00 she's free until 15:00. Diane is free from 10:00-14:30 (her next block starts at 14:30). Jack's blocks are 13:30-14:00 and 14:30-15:00. So at 14:00-14:30, Jack is free. Eugene is blocked until 14:30 (his block is 12:00-14:30). So he's free from 14:30 onward. Wait, no: Eugene's block is 12:00-14:30, so until 14:30. So 14:00-14:30, Eugene is still blocked. So this time is out.\n\nNext, 14:30-15:00. Diane is blocked here (14:30-15:00). Jack is also blocked (14:30-15:00). So this time is out.\n\nAfter 15:00, let's see:\n\nEugene is blocked from 15:00-16:30. Patricia is blocked from 15:00-16:30. So their next available is 16:30-17:00. Let's check that slot.\n\n16:30-17:00: Eugene is free (block ends at 16:30). Patricia is free (block ends at 16:30). Diane is free (no blocks after 15:00 until 17:00). Jack's last block is 14:30-15:00, so after 15:00, he's free. So 16:30-17:00: All four are available. But the meeting needs to be 30 minutes. So 16:30-17:00 is possible. But let's check if there's any other slots.\n\nWait, let's double-check. Are there any other possible times?\n\nLooking at the earlier afternoon, between 15:00 and 16:30. Eugene and Patricia are blocked. So no. What about between 14:30-15:00? Diane and Jack are blocked. So no.\n\nWhat about 15:00-15:30? Diane is free (her block ended at 15:00). Jack is free (his block ended at 15:00). But Eugene is blocked until 16:30. Patricia is blocked until 16:30. So that's no good.\n\nSo the only possible slot is 16:30-17:00. But wait, the work hours are until 17:00, so a meeting from 16:30-17:00 is allowed. Let's confirm each person's availability:\n\n- Diane: No blocks after 15:00. Free from 15:00-17:00 except maybe? Her blocks were 9:30-10:00, 14:30-15:00. So after 15:00, she's free until 17:00. So 16:30-17:00 is okay.\n\n- Jack: His last block is 14:30-15:00. After that, free until 17:00. So yes.\n\n- Eugene: Blocked until 16:30. So from 16:30-17:00, he's free.\n\n- Patricia: Blocked until 16:30. So from 16:30-17:00, she's free.\n\nSo all four are available from 16:30-17:00. That's a 30-minute slot. So that's the answer.",
