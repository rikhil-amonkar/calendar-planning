            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for Natalie, David, Douglas, Ralph, and Jordan. The meeting should be half an hour long between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Also, David doesn't want to meet before 14:00. Let's start by listing everyone's busy times and then find a gap where all are free.\n\nFirst, Natalie is free all day, so no problem there. David is busy 11:30-12:00 and 14:30-15:00. But he can't meet before 14:00. So David's available after 14:00, except 14:30-15:00. So his available slots are from 15:00 onwards, but wait, let's check.\n\nWait, David's busy times are 11:30-12:00 and 14:30-15:00. But his preference is not to meet before 14:00. So he's available from 14:00 onwards, but he has a meeting from 14:30-15:00. So after 14:00, his available times are 14:00-14:30 and then 15:00 onwards. But the work hours end at 17:00, so he's available from 15:00 to 17:00, except other meetings. Wait, does he have any other meetings after 15:00? The problem states his busy times are those two, so after 15:00 he's free.\n\nNow Douglas's schedule: busy at 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00. So after 15:00, Douglas is free. Let's check Ralph. Ralph has meetings 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 11:30-12:30, 13:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So after 15:00, Ralph is busy from 15:30-16:00 and 16:30-17:00. So between 15:00-15:30 and 16:00-16:30, Ralph is free. Then Jordan's busy times: 9:00-10:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00. So Jordan is free from 15:00-15:30, and maybe 10:00-12:00, but considering David's preference, we need after 14:00.\n\nSo putting this together: David can't meet before 14:00, so the earliest possible start time is 14:00. Let's check available slots after 14:00.\n\nFrom 14:00-14:30: David is free (since his only conflict here is 14:30-15:00). Let's check others. Natalie is free. Douglas: from 14:30-15:00 he's busy, so at 14:00-14:30, is Douglas free? Looking at his schedule: his blocked times are 9:30-10:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00. So yes, 14:00-14:30 is free for Douglas. Ralph: at 14:00-14:30, Ralph's schedule shows he's busy from 13:30-15:00. So Ralph is busy until 15:00. So this slot is not possible.\n\nNext slot after 15:00. Let's see. From 15:00 onwards. David is free after 15:00. Douglas is free after 15:00. Ralph is free from 15:00-15:30. Jordan is free from 15:00-15:30 (since his next busy time is 15:30-17:00). So 15:00-15:30: is that possible? Let's check everyone:\n\nNatalie: free.\nDavid: free (his next meeting is at 14:30-15:00, so after 15:00 he's free).\nDouglas: free.\nRalph: 15:00-15:30 is free (his next meeting is 15:30-16:00).\nJordan: free until 15:30.\n\nSo 15:00-15:30 works for all. Let me check each person's schedule again to confirm.\n\nNatalie: all clear.\nDavid: after 15:00, he's free. His only conflicts were before 14:30, and the 14:30-15:00 slot. So 15:00-15:30 is good.\nDouglas: after 15:00, free.\nRalph: 13:30-15:00 is busy, so at 15:00-15:30, he's free until 15:30 when he has a meeting at 15:30-16:00.\nJordan: busy from 15:30-17:00, so 15:00-15:30 is free.\n\nSo that slot works. The meeting is 30 minutes, so 15:00-15:30. That's within work hours, and meets all constraints. David's preference is satisfied as it's after 14:00.\n\nAnother possible slot: 16:00-16:30. Let's check. Ralph is busy 16:30-17:00, but from 16:00-16:30, he's free. Jordan is busy after 15:30, so 16:00-16:30 is Jordan busy? Jordan's busy from 15:30-17:00, so yes, that's blocked. So 16:00-16:30 is no good for Jordan.\n\nAnother slot: 15:30-16:00. Ralph has a meeting then, so that's out. So the only possible slot is 15:00-15:30.",
