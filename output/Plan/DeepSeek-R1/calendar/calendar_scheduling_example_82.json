            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for Michael, Eric, and Arthur. The meeting should be half an hour long between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Let me look at each person's schedule.\n\nFirst, Michael's schedule: he has meetings from 9:30-10:30, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-16:30. So his busy times are those slots. Then Eric has nothing all day, which is easy. Arthur's calendar is blocked from 9:00-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00. \n\nI need to find a 30-minute window where all three are free. Let's list the available time slots for each and find overlaps.\n\nStarting with the work hours from 9:00 to 17:00. Let's break it down:\n\nMichael's available times would be:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:30-15:00\n- 15:30-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nBut wait, Arthur's blocked times complicate things. Let's check Arthur's availability. Arthur is busy until 12:00, then again 13:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and after 16:30. So Arthur's available times are:\n- 12:00-13:00\n- 15:00-15:30\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck. Arthur's blocked times are 9-12, 13-15, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00. So between those blocks, his available times are:\n12:00-13:00 (1 hour)\n15:00-15:30 (30 minutes)\n16:00-16:30 (30 minutes)\n\nNow, Michael's available times during those periods:\n\nFrom 12:00-13:00: Michael is free (since his next meeting is at 15:00). Eric is free. So that's a possible slot. But Arthur is free here. So 12:00-13:00 is a possible window. But we need a 30-minute slot. So maybe 12:00-12:30 or 12:30-13:00.\n\nBut let's check other possible times. Let's look at 15:00-15:30. Arthur is available here. Michael's next meeting starts at 15:00, so he's busy from 15:00-15:30. Wait, no. Michael's schedule says 15:00 to 15:30 is a meeting. So during 15:00-15:30, Michael is busy. So that slot is out for Michael, even though Arthur is free. So that's not possible.\n\nNext, 16:00-16:30. Arthur is free here. Michael's schedule shows he has a meeting from 16:00-16:30. So Michael is busy then. So that's not possible either.\n\nSo the only overlapping available time for all three would be between 12:00 and 13:00. Let's check Michael's availability during that time. Michael's meetings are at 9:30-10:30 and then nothing until 15:00. So from 10:30 to 15:00, he's free. So 12:00-13:00 is within that. Eric is free. Arthur is free from 12:00-13:00. So that's the slot.\n\nSo possible times: 12:00-12:30, 12:30-13:00. Either would work. Let's pick the earliest possible, maybe 12:00-12:30. But need to make sure that all three are available. Yes, because in that slot, Michael is free, Eric is free, Arthur is free (since his 9-12 block ends at 12:00, so 12:00 is the start of his available time). So 12:00-12:30 is possible. Alternatively, 12:30-13:00 is also possible. Since the meeting duration is half an hour, both slots work. Let's choose one. The answer might have either, but perhaps the first available slot. Let me check again.\n\nArthur's blocked until 12:00, so from 12:00 onward. So 12:00 is available. Michael is free from 10:30 to 15:00. Eric is free. So 12:00-12:30 is a valid time. Alternatively, 12:30-13:00 is also valid. Both are possible. Let's check if there's any other possible slots. For example, after 16:30. But Arthur is blocked from 16:30-17:00. Michael is free from 16:30-17:00. But Arthur is not. So no. Between 15:30-16:00, Arthur is busy (15:30-16:00). Michael's available at 15:30-16:00, but Arthur isn't. So the only overlapping time is 12:00-13:00. So the meeting can be scheduled at either 12:00-12:30 or 12:30-13:00. Either is acceptable. The answer could be either. Let's pick the first one. So {\"time_range\": \"{12:00:12:30}\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}.",
