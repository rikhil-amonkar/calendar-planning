            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. So, the goal is to find a half-hour meeting time between Julie and Ruth on Monday to Thursday, within 9:00 to 17:00 work hours. Let's look at their schedules and constraints.\n\nFirst, Julie's schedule: She has no meetings all week, which is great. But she wants to avoid meetings on Thursday before 11:30. So on Thursday, any time from 11:30 onwards is okay for her.\n\nNow, Ruth's schedule: She's busy all day Monday (9-17), same on Tuesday. Wednesday also fully busy. Thursday is a bit complicated. On Thursday, Ruth is busy from 9:00 to 11:00, then 11:30 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 17:00. Wait, let me parse that correctly. So on Thursday, Ruth's busy periods are:\n\n- 9:00-11:00\n- 11:30-14:30\n- 15:00-17:00\n\nSo between those times, she's busy. That leaves gaps on Thursday. Let's see. The gaps would be:\n\n- After 11:00 to 11:30 (30 minutes)\n- After 14:30 to 15:00 (30 minutes)\n\nBut the meeting needs to be half an hour. The first gap is exactly 30 minutes (11:00-11:30). But Julie wants to avoid Thursday before 11:30. So that gap is before 11:30 on Thursday, which Julie would prefer to avoid. So that's out.\n\nThe next gap on Thursday is from 14:30 to 15:00. That's a 30-minute window. So from 14:30 to 15:00. But wait, Ruth's schedule says she's busy from 11:30 to 14:30 and then 15:00 to 17:00. So between 14:30 and 15:00, she's free. That's a 30-minute slot. Julie is available then because her only constraint is avoiding Thursday before 11:30. So this time slot on Thursday from 14:30 to 15:00 fits both their schedules and Julie's preference. \n\nCheck the days again. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday: Ruth is busy all day, so those days are out. Only Thursday has available slots. The only possible slot is 14:30-15:00 on Thursday. That works for both, right? Let's confirm. Ruth is free there, and Julie can do that time since it's after 11:30. Yes. So that's the solution.",
