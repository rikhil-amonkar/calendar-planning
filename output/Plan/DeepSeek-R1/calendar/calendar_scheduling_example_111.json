            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for Gregory, Natalie, Christine, and Vincent on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The meeting should be half an hour long. Let me go through each person's schedule step by step.\n\nFirst, Gregory's blocked times: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00. So his available slots are from 10:00-10:30, 11:30-12:30, 13:00-13:30, and 14:00 onwards until 17:00. Wait, but his last block ends at 14:00, so he's free from 14:00 to 17:00.\n\nNatalie has nothing scheduled, so she's free all day.\n\nChristine has meetings from 9:00-11:30 and 13:30-17:00. So her available times are 11:30-13:30. Wait, no. From 9:00 to 11:30, then after 11:30 until 13:30 she's free? Because her next meeting starts at 13:30. So her available slot is 11:30-13:30. Then after 13:30 she's busy until 17:00.\n\nVincent's blocked times: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-12:00, 12:30-14:00, 14:30-17:00. So his available slots are 9:30-10:30, 12:00-12:30, 14:00-14:30. Wait, because his blocks are 9:00-9:30, then free until 10:30, then blocked until 12:00. Then from 12:00-12:30 he's free? Then blocked again from 12:30-14:00. After that, he's free from 14:00-14:30, then blocked until 17:00.\n\nNow I need to find a 30-minute window where all four are available.\n\nLet's list possible time slots where everyone is free.\n\nLooking at Christine's availability first since she has the most restrictive schedule. She's free between 11:30-13:30. So the meeting has to be within this time.\n\nNow, check others' availability within 11:30-13:30.\n\nGregory's available in 11:30-12:30 (since his next block is 12:30-13:00). Wait, Gregory's blocked from 12:30-13:00. So between 11:30-12:30 he's free. Then after 12:30, he's busy until 13:00, then free from 13:00-13:30. Wait, Gregory's schedule: 12:30-13:00 is blocked. So after 12:30, he's busy until 13:00. Then from 13:00-13:30, he's free again. Then 13:30-14:00 is blocked. So within Christine's 11:30-13:30 window, Gregory is available from 11:30-12:30 and 13:00-13:30.\n\nVincent's availability during 11:30-13:30: Vincent's blocked from 10:30-12:00, so after 12:00 he's free until 12:30. Then blocked from 12:30-14:00. So within Christine's 11:30-13:30 window, Vincent is available only from 12:00-12:30. Because 11:30-12:00 he's still blocked (since his block ends at 12:00). Wait, his schedule says 10:30-12:00 is blocked. So at 12:00, he becomes free until 12:30. Then from 12:30-14:00, he's blocked again. So in the 11:30-13:30 window, Vincent is only free from 12:00-12:30.\n\nSo combining all:\n\nPossible slots within Christine's availability (11:30-13:30) where all are free:\n\nCheck Gregory's available 11:30-12:30 and 13:00-13:30.\n\nVincent's available 12:00-12:30.\n\nChristine is available 11:30-13:30.\n\nNatalie is always available.\n\nSo overlapping times would be:\n\nFrom 12:00-12:30. Because Gregory is free 11:30-12:30, Vincent is free 12:00-12:30, Christine is free, Natalie is free. So the overlapping time here is 12:00-12:30. That's a 30-minute slot. That works.\n\nAnother possible slot: 13:00-13:30. But Christine is available until 13:30, right? Wait, Christine's available until 13:30, but Vincent is blocked from 12:30-14:00. So Vincent isn't available at 13:00. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the only possible slot is 12:00-12:30. Let's confirm:\n\nGregory: 12:00-12:30 is within his 11:30-12:30 free time. Yes.\n\nVincent: 12:00-12:30 is his available slot. Yes.\n\nChristine: 12:00-12:30 is within her 11:30-13:30. Yes.\n\nNatalie: Yes.\n\nSo the meeting can be scheduled from 12:00 to 12:30 on Monday.",
