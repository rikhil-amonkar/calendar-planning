            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a meeting for seven people: Daniel, Kathleen, Carolyn, Roger, Cheryl, Virginia, and Angela. The meeting is supposed to be half an hour between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Also, Roger prefers not to meet before 12:30. Let's start by listing everyone's busy times and then find a slot where all are free.\n\nFirst, Daniel and Roger have no meetings all day, so their schedules are clear except for Roger's preference. Kathleen is busy from 14:30 to 15:30. Carolyn has blocks at 12:00-12:30 and 13:00-13:30. Cheryl's busy times are 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30, 12:30-13:30, and 14:00-17:00. Virginia is busy 9:30-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00. Angela has blocks at 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-16:30.\n\nRoger doesn't want to meet before 12:30, so possible times are from 12:30 onwards. Let's check each time slot after 12:30.\n\nStarting from 12:30:\n\n12:30-13:00: Carolyn is free (her blocks are 12-12:30 and 13-13:30). But Cheryl is busy from 12:30-13:30, so that's out.\n\n13:30-14:00: Let's check. Carolyn is free after 13:30. Cheryl is busy until 14:00? Her schedule says busy until 13:30, then 14:00-17:00. So 13:30-14:00. Cheryl is free from 13:30 to 14:00? Wait, no. Cheryl's busy periods are 9:00-9:30, 10-11:30, 12:30-13:30, 14:00-17:00. So between 13:30 and 14:00, she's free? Wait, from 13:30 to 14:00, she's not in any of her busy times except 14:00 starts at 14:00. So 13:30-14:00 is free for Cheryl. What about others? Let's see:\n\nDaniel and Roger are free. Kathleen is free before 14:30. Carolyn is free (her blocks end at 12:30 and 13:30). Virginia's schedule: she's busy 13:00-13:30, so after that until 14:30. So Virginia is free from 13:30 to 14:30. Angela's blocks: her last block before this time is 13:00-13:30, then next block starts at 14:00. So Angela is free from 13:30 to 14:00. So 13:30-14:00 slot works? Let's check all:\n\n- Daniel: free\n- Kathleen: free until 14:30\n- Carolyn: free\n- Roger: after 12:30, so okay\n- Cheryl: 13:30-14:00 is free (her next meeting starts at 14:00)\n- Virginia: free from 13:30 to 14:30\n- Angela: free from 13:30 to 14:00\n\nSo that's a 30-minute slot. Wait, but wait, Cheryl's schedule says she's busy 14:00-17:00. So from 13:30 to 14:00, she's free. So 13:30-14:00 is possible. But wait, let me confirm:\n\nCheryl's busy times: 12:30-13:30 and 14:00-17:00. So between 13:30 and 14:00, she's free. So that's a 30-minute window. Similarly, Angela's blocked until 14:00? Angela's blocked during 14:00-16:30. So from 13:30 to 14:00, she's free. Yes. So that's a possible slot.\n\nBut what about Roger's preference? He prefers not before 12:30, so this slot is after 12:30, so that's okay.\n\nAnother possible time: maybe after 16:30? Let's check. The end time is 17:00. So from 16:30-17:00. But Cheryl is busy until 17:00. Angela is free after 16:30. Virginia is busy 16:00-17:00. So Virginia is not free. So that's out.\n\nWhat about 15:30-16:00? Let's see. Kathleen is busy until 15:30. So after 15:30, Kathleen is free. Cheryl is busy until 17:00. So she's not free here. Virginia is busy 14:30-15:30 and 16:00-17:00. So from 15:30-16:00, Virginia is free? No, her next busy time starts at 16:00. So 15:30-16:00 is free for Virginia. But Cheryl is busy until 17:00, so that's a problem. So that slot won't work.\n\nHow about 11:30-12:00? But Roger prefers not before 12:30, so that's before 12:30. So that's out.\n\nAnother possible time: 12:00-12:30. But Carolyn is busy 12-12:30. Virginia is busy 12-12:30. Angela is busy 12-12:30. So no.\n\nSo the only possible time seems to be 13:30-14:00. Let me double-check all participants:\n\nDaniel: free\nKathleen: free until 14:30\nCarolyn: free (her last block was 13:00-13:30)\nRoger: free and after 12:30\nCheryl: free (13:30-14:00 is between her 12:30-13:30 and 14:00-17:00 blocks)\nVirginia: free from 13:30 to 14:30\nAngela: free from 13:30 to 14:00\n\nYes, everyone is free during 13:30-14:00. That's a 30-minute window. So that should work.",
