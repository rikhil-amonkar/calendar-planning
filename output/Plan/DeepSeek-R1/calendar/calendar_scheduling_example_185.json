            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule a 30-minute meeting for Kimberly, Megan, Marie, and Diana on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. Let me check their schedules and constraints.\n\nFirst, Kimberly's busy times: 10:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 16:00-16:30. Megan has no meetings, but she wants to avoid meetings before 10:00. Marie's busy: 10:00-11:00, 11:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30. Diana's schedule: 9:30-10:00, 10:30-14:30, 15:30-17:00.\n\nSo the available time must be a 30-minute slot when all four are free. Let's break down the day hour by hour.\n\nStarting after 10:00 because Megan can't do before 10. Let's check between 10:00 and 17:00.\n\nLooking for gaps:\n\nFrom 9:00 to 10:00: Megan can't do before 10, so earliest start is 10:00. But Diana is busy until 10:00 (9:30-10:00), so maybe 10:00? Let's check.\n\nAt 10:00: Kimberly has a meeting until 10:30. Marie is busy 10:00-11:00. So 10:00-10:30 is out. Next possible after 10:30.\n\n10:30-11:00: Kimberly is free (her next meeting starts at 11). But Diana is busy from 10:30 to 14:30. So Diana can't attend. So that's out.\n\n11:00-11:30: Kimberly has a meeting from 11:00 to 12:00. Marie is busy until 11:00, then from 11:30 to 15:00. So between 11:00 and 11:30, Marie is free? Wait, Marie is busy 10-11, then 11:30-15:00. So from 11:00 to 11:30, she's free for 30 minutes? Let me check. Yes, 11:00-11:30 Marie is free. But Kimberly is busy from 11:00-12:00. So Kimberly can't attend. So that slot is no good.\n\nAfter 12:00, Kimberly is busy until 12:00. Then she's free until 16:00. Marie is busy until 15:00. Diana is busy until 14:30. So after 14:30 (2:30 PM), Diana is free until 15:30. Let's check 14:30-15:30.\n\nFrom 14:30 to 15:30:\n\nKimberly is free (her next meeting is 16:00). Megan is free. Marie is free after 15:00. So from 15:00 onward. Let's check 15:00-15:30. Marie is free, Kimberly is free, Diana is free until 15:30. Diana's next meeting is 15:30-17:00. So 15:00-15:30 is available. Wait, 15:00 to 15:30 would be a 30-minute slot. Let's confirm:\n\nKimberly: 12:00-16:00 free? Wait, Kimberly's meetings: 10-10:30, 11-12, 16-16:30. So after 12:00, she's free until 16:00. Correct. So 15:00-15:30 is free for Kimberly.\n\nMegan: All day free except before 10. So yes.\n\nMarie: Busy until 15:00. So after 15:00, she's free. So 15:00-15:30 is okay.\n\nDiana: Busy until 14:30, then free from 14:30 to 15:30. So 14:30 to 15:30 she's available. So 15:00-15:30 would be within her free time.\n\nWait, Diana's busy until 14:30 (2:30 PM), then free until 15:30 (3:30 PM). So 14:30-15:30 is Diana's free time. So if we pick 14:30-15:00, would that work? Let's check.\n\nAt 14:30-15:00:\n\nKimberly is free. Megan is free. Marie is busy until 15:00. So Marie can't attend before 15:00. So that slot is out.\n\nSo the next available is 15:00-15:30. Let's check:\n\nKimberly: free. Megan: free. Marie: free after 15:00. Diana: free until 15:30. So all four can attend 15:00-15:30.\n\nWait, but Diana is busy from 15:30 to 17:00. So 15:00-15:30 is her available time. Yes. That's a 30-minute window. Let me confirm again:\n\n- Kimberly: 15:00-15:30 is free (no meetings).\n- Megan: yes.\n- Marie: 15:00 onward is free (her last meeting ends at 15:00).\n- Diana: free from 14:30 to 15:30. So 15:00-15:30 is within that.\n\nThat seems like a valid slot. Let me check if there's any other possible times. What about between 16:30 and 17:00?\n\nKimberly has a meeting until 16:30. Her next meeting is 16:00-16:30. So she's free after 16:30. Diana is busy from 15:30-17:00, so she can't attend after 15:30. So that's out. So 15:00-15:30 is the only possible slot.",
