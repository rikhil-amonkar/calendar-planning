            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, I need to plan a day in San Francisco to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and their availability. Let's start by listing out all the friends, their locations, available times, and the minimum meeting durations.\n\nFirst, the constraints:\n\n- Start at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM.\n- Kenneth: Richmond District, 9:15 PM to 10:00 PM. Need at least 30 minutes. But wait, the earliest I can meet him is 9:15 PM, but the latest end is 10 PM. So possible meeting time is 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM (30 minutes). But since the user arrives at 9 AM, the day ends by 10 PM, right?\n\nWait, but the user is arriving at Embarcadero at 9 AM. The latest meeting is Kenneth at Richmond District until 10 PM. But how does the day end? Probably need to end by 10 PM.\n\nOther friends:\n\n- Lisa: Union Square, 9 AM to 4:30 PM. Needs 45 minutes.\n- Joshua: Financial District, 12 PM to 3:15 PM. Needs 15 minutes.\n- Nancy: Pacific Heights, 8 AM to 11:30 AM. Needs 90 minutes. Wait, Nancy's available until 11:30 AM, so the meeting must end by 11:30 AM. But the user starts at 9 AM. To get 90 minutes, the latest start time would be 10:00 AM, because 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM is 1.5 hours. But travel time from Embarcadero to Pacific Heights is 11 minutes. So leaving Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, arriving at 9:11 AM. Then meeting from 9:11 AM to 10:41 AM? But Nancy is only available until 11:30 AM. Wait, 90 minutes is 1.5 hours. So if the user arrives at 9:11 AM, they can meet from 9:11 AM to 10:41 AM (90 minutes), which is within Nancy's availability (8 AM to 11:30 AM). But does the user need to meet the full 90 minutes? The minimum is 90, so maybe they have to meet exactly 90 minutes. So that's possible.\n\nBut let's check other possibilities. Maybe Nancy is the first meeting. Let's see. Starting at Embarcadero at 9 AM, travel to Pacific Heights takes 11 minutes. Arrive at 9:11 AM. Meet from 9:11 AM to 10:41 AM. Then, after that, where to next?\n\nNext, after Nancy, maybe Andrew at Nob Hill. Andrew is available from 11:30 AM to 8:15 PM. Needs 60 minutes. But after Nancy's meeting ends at 10:41 AM, the next possible is to go to Andrew's location. From Pacific Heights to Nob Hill takes 8 minutes. So arriving at 10:49 AM. But Andrew is available from 11:30 AM. So there's a gap from 10:49 AM to 11:30 AM. That's about 41 minutes. Not ideal. Maybe can fit another meeting here?\n\nAlternatively, after Nancy, maybe go to Lisa at Union Square. Lisa is available until 4:30 PM. Let's see. From Pacific Heights to Union Square is 15 minutes (wait, looking at the travel times: Pacific Heights to Union Square is 12 minutes. Wait, the travel times are listed as from Pacific Heights to other locations. Let me check:\n\nTravel from Pacific Heights to Union Square is 12 minutes. So leaving Pacific Heights at 10:41 AM, arrive at Union Square at 10:53 AM. Lisa's available until 4:30 PM, needs 45 minutes. So meeting from 10:53 AM to 11:38 AM. That's 45 minutes. Then after that, perhaps go to Andrew at Nob Hill. From Union Square to Nob Hill is 7 minutes (if the travel time is Union Square to Nob Hill: looking at the matrix, Union Square to Nob Hill is 9 minutes? Wait, no. Let me check the travel times again.\n\nLooking at the travel times:\n\nFrom Union Square to Nob Hill: 9 minutes. So if leaving Union Square at 11:38 AM, arrive at Nob Hill at 11:47 AM. But Andrew is available from 11:30 AM. So that's okay. Then meet Andrew from 11:47 AM to 12:47 PM (60 minutes). Then after that, maybe Joshua in Financial District. Joshua is available from 12 PM to 3:15 PM, needs 15 minutes. From Nob Hill to Financial District is 9 minutes (Nob Hill to Financial District: 9 minutes). So leaving Nob Hill at 12:47 PM, arrive at Financial District at 12:56 PM. Joshua can meet from 12:56 PM to 1:11 PM (15 minutes). Then after that, perhaps John in Bayview. John is available from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM, needs 75 minutes. But let's see the time after Joshua.\n\nAfter Joshua at 1:11 PM, maybe check if there's time to meet others. Let's see the remaining friends: Kenneth (late), John (evening), and Andrew already met.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua, maybe check Lisa again, but Lisa's available until 4:30 PM. But maybe there's time to meet others. Wait, John's meeting requires 75 minutes, which is 1 hour 15 minutes. So John's meeting needs to start by 8:15 PM (since 8:15 PM + 1h15m = 9:30 PM). But the user needs to get to Bayview. Let's plan for John later.\n\nSo after Joshua at 1:11 PM, next could be Andrew again? But Andrew's already met. Wait, no, Andrew is only one meeting. Each person is to be met once. So once we meet Andrew, that's done.\n\nWait, the problem says \"meet as many friends as possible\". So each friend can be met once. So the goal is to include as many as possible.\n\nSo far, in the current plan: Nancy (Pacific Heights), Lisa (Union Square), Andrew (Nob Hill), Joshua (Financial District). That's four friends. Then John (Bayview) and Kenneth (Richmond). So total possible six friends. But can we fit all?\n\nLet's check the times.\n\nAfter Joshua's meeting ends at 1:11 PM, what's next? Let's see John's availability: 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM. Needs 75 minutes. So need to schedule John's meeting for at least 75 minutes. Let's plan to meet John starting as early as possible, say 4:45 PM. Then from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM (75 minutes). But travel time to Bayview from Financial District. Let's check.\n\nFrom Financial District to Bayview is 19 minutes. So leaving Financial District at 1:11 PM, but that's too early. Wait, perhaps after Joshua, there's a gap. Let's see:\n\nAfter Joshua ends at 1:11 PM, the next possible meeting is John at Bayview starting at 4:45 PM. So between 1:11 PM and 4:45 PM, can we meet anyone else? Let's check Lisa again, but she's available until 4:30 PM. If we can fit another meeting with Lisa. But Lisa's minimum is 45 minutes. Wait, but we already met Lisa from 10:53 AM to 11:38 AM. So she's already met. So no, each friend is met once.\n\nSo between 1:11 PM and 4:45 PM, there's a gap. But maybe that's unavoidable. Let's proceed.\n\nSo after Joshua at 1:11 PM, the next is John at Bayview. Let's see the travel time from Financial District to Bayview is 19 minutes. So leaving Financial District at 1:11 PM, arriving at Bayview at 1:30 PM. But John is only available from 4:45 PM. So that's too early. So can't meet John yet. Hmm. So maybe that gap is a problem. Alternatively, perhaps after Joshua, go somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the current plan. Let's re-examine.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to fit all six friends. Let's see.\n\nStarting at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM.\n\nFirst, meet Nancy at Pacific Heights. Travel time 11 minutes, arrive 9:11 AM. Meet 90 minutes until 10:41 AM.\n\nNext, go to Lisa at Union Square. Travel time 12 minutes (Pacific Heights to Union Square is 12 minutes). Arrive 10:53 AM. Meet 45 minutes until 11:38 AM.\n\nThen, go to Andrew at Nob Hill. Travel time 7 minutes (Union Square to Nob Hill is 9 minutes). Wait, looking at the travel times: Union Square to Nob Hill is 9 minutes. So leaving at 11:38 AM, arrive at 11:47 AM. Meet Andrew from 11:47 AM to 12:47 PM.\n\nThen go to Joshua at Financial District. Travel time from Nob Hill to Financial District is 9 minutes. Arrive at 12:56 PM. Meet 15 minutes until 1:11 PM.\n\nThen, after Joshua, need to meet John at Bayview. Travel time from Financial District to Bayview is 19 minutes. Arrive at 1:30 PM. But John is available from 4:45 PM. So that's a problem. Can't meet John until 4:45 PM. So the time between 1:11 PM and 4:45 PM is 3 hours 34 minutes. That's a long gap. Maybe use that time to meet someone else, but all other friends are already scheduled (Nancy, Lisa, Andrew, Joshua). The remaining are John and Kenneth.\n\nKenneth is available from 9:15 PM to 10:00 PM. Needs 30 minutes. So meet Kenneth from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM.\n\nJohn needs to be met for 75 minutes between 4:45 PM and 9:30 PM. So let's plan John's meeting after 4:45 PM.\n\nSo after Joshua at 1:11 PM, the user has free time until 4:45 PM. Then go to Bayview. Let's see: leaving Financial District at 1:11 PM, but John's not available until 4:45 PM. So perhaps the user can stay in Financial District or go somewhere else, but there's no other friends available. Alternatively, maybe adjust the schedule to meet John later.\n\nSo let's plan John's meeting from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM (75 minutes). Then, travel from Bayview to Richmond District to meet Kenneth. Travel time from Bayview to Richmond District is 25 minutes. So leaving Bayview at 6:00 PM, arrive at Richmond District at 6:25 PM. But Kenneth is available from 9:15 PM. So that's too early. So that won't work. So there's a conflict here. Therefore, meeting John and Kenneth in the same schedule may not be possible because of the time constraints.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe skip John and meet Kenneth. Or vice versa. Let's see.\n\nIf we try to meet both John and Kenneth:\n\nJohn's meeting requires 75 minutes. Let's schedule John from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM (75 minutes). Then travel to Richmond District. From Bayview to Richmond District is 25 minutes. So leaving at 6:00 PM, arrive at 6:25 PM. But Kenneth is available from 9:15 PM. So there's a 2 hour 50 minute gap. Not ideal. Alternatively, can we schedule John later? For example, John's latest start time is 8:15 PM (since 8:15 PM + 1h15m = 9:30 PM). So meet John from 8:15 PM to 9:30 PM. Then, travel to Richmond District to meet Kenneth. Travel time from Bayview to Richmond District is 25 minutes. So leaving Bayview at 9:30 PM, arrive at Richmond District at 9:55 PM. But Kenneth is available until 10:00 PM, so meeting from 9:55 PM to 10:00 PM would only be 5 minutes, which is less than the required 30 minutes. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, if we leave Bayview earlier. For example, meet John from 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM. Then travel to Richmond District takes 25 minutes, arriving at 8:40 PM. But Kenneth is available from 9:15 PM. So that leaves 35 minutes before Kenneth's availability. So can't meet him yet. Therefore, it's impossible to meet both John and Kenneth because of the travel time and their availability.\n\nTherefore, the user must choose between meeting John or Kenneth. Since the goal is to meet as many as possible, perhaps the best is to meet five friends, dropping either John or Kenneth. Let's see which one can be scheduled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to fit both. Let's re-examine the timing.\n\nSuppose after meeting Joshua at 1:11 PM, the user has time until 4:45 PM. Then meet John from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM. Then travel from Bayview to Richmond District takes 25 minutes, arriving at 6:25 PM. But Kenneth is available from 9:15 PM. So the user has to wait until 9:15 PM to meet Kenneth. But that leaves 2 hours and 50 minutes between 6:25 PM and 9:15 PM. Can that time be used for another meeting? But all other friends are already met. So the user can't do anything else. But maybe that's acceptable if it allows meeting both John and Kenneth. However, Kenneth's meeting requires 30 minutes, from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. Then travel from Richmond District back? Not necessary since the day ends there.\n\nSo in this case, the user can meet John from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM, then wait until 9:15 PM to meet Kenneth. That would meet five friends: Nancy, Lisa, Andrew, Joshua, John, and Kenneth. Wait, that's six. Wait, no, John and Kenneth would be the fifth and sixth. Wait, in the initial plan, we have four friends: Nancy, Lisa, Andrew, Joshua. Then adding John and Kenneth would make six. But the problem is the time between John's meeting and Kenneth's. So in this case, the schedule would be:\n\n1. Nancy: 9:11 AM - 10:41 AM\n\n2. Lisa: 10:53 AM - 11:38 AM\n\n3. Andrew: 11:47 AM - 12:47 PM\n\n4. Joshua: 12:56 PM - 1:11 PM\n\n5. John: 4:45 PM - 6:00 PM\n\n6. Kenneth: 9:15 PM - 9:45 PM\n\nBut between 1:11 PM and 4:45 PM, there's a gap. And between 6:00 PM and 9:15 PM, another gap. But if the user can wait, then it's possible. But is there a way to fill those gaps?\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua at 1:11 PM, maybe go back to Andrew? But Andrew is already met. Or Lisa? Also met. So no. So perhaps the gaps are unavoidable. But the user can meet all six friends. Is that possible?\n\nWait, but let's check the travel times:\n\nFrom Joshua's location (Financial District) to John's location (Bayview) is 19 minutes. So after Joshua ends at 1:11 PM, the user can go to Bayview but John isn't available until 4:45 PM. So arriving at 1:30 PM, which is way too early. So the user has to wait until 4:45 PM. That's a 3-hour wait. Not efficient, but possible if the goal is to meet as many as possible.\n\nThen, after John's meeting ends at 6:00 PM, travel to Richmond District (25 minutes) arrives at 6:25 PM. Then wait until 9:15 PM to meet Kenneth. That's almost 3 hours. But if the user is willing to wait, then they can meet all six. However, this seems inefficient with long waiting times, but the problem states to optimize the schedule to meet as many friends as possible. So including all six would be better.\n\nBut wait, let's verify all the timings:\n\n- Nancy: 9:11 AM -10:41 AM (correct)\n\n- Lisa: Pacific Heights to Union Square is 12 minutes. Arrive 10:53 AM, meet until 11:38 AM.\n\n- Then Union Square to Nob Hill: 9 minutes. Arrive 11:47 AM, meet Andrew until 12:47 PM.\n\n- Nob Hill to Financial District: 9 minutes. Arrive 12:56 PM, meet Joshua until 1:11 PM.\n\n- Financial District to Bayview: 19 minutes. Arrive 1:30 PM. Wait until 4:45 PM (3h15m). Then meet John from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM.\n\n- Bayview to Richmond District: 25 minutes. Arrive 6:25 PM. Wait until 9:15 PM. Meet Kenneth from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM.\n\nSo that's six friends. But the problem says \"optimize the schedule\" considering travel times and constraints. Is there a way to reduce the waiting time and meet all six?\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe adjust the order to reduce gaps. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Joshua at 1:11 PM, perhaps meet John later but find a way to use the time. For example, after Joshua, maybe go to a location closer to John's, but I don't think that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, can we meet John earlier? John is available from 4:45 PM. So the earliest start is 4:45 PM. So meeting him from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM.\n\nThen, after that, travel to Richmond District (25 minutes) arrive 6:25 PM. Then, the user has time until 9:15 PM. That's a long wait. But perhaps there's a way to meet someone else, but all other friends are already met.\n\nAnother idea: Can we meet Kenneth first and then John? Let's check. Kenneth is available from 9:15 PM. If the user meets Kenneth first, but John's available until 9:30 PM. So meet Kenneth from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM, then travel to Bayview to meet John? But John's available until 9:30 PM. So impossible. Because arriving at Bayview after 9:45 PM + travel time (25 minutes) would be 10:10 PM, which is after John's availability.\n\nThus, it's not possible to meet both John and Kenneth if we meet Kenneth first.\n\nSo the only way to meet both is to meet John first and then Kenneth, but with a long wait.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of friends is six, but with significant waiting time. But the problem states to optimize the schedule. So maybe the best is to meet five friends, skipping one to avoid long waits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the order to fit more efficiently.\n\nWait, let's consider another approach. What if we start with Lisa instead of Nancy?\n\nStarting at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. Lisa is at Union Square from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM. Needs 45 minutes.\n\nTravel time from Embarcadero to Union Square is 10 minutes. Arrive at 9:10 AM. Meet from 9:10 AM to 9:55 AM.\n\nThen, go to Nancy at Pacific Heights. Union Square to Pacific Heights is 15 minutes. Arrive at 10:10 AM. Meet Nancy from 10:10 AM to 11:40 AM (90 minutes). But Nancy is available until 11:30 AM. So this would end at 11:40 AM, which is 10 minutes after her availability ends. So not possible. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative: After meeting Lisa, go to Nancy, but adjust the meeting time.\n\nIf we meet Lisa from 9:10 AM to 9:55 AM, then travel to Pacific Heights (15 minutes) arrive at 10:10 AM. Meet Nancy until 11:40 AM. But Nancy's available until 11:30 AM. So the meeting would end at 11:40 AM, which is 10 minutes over. So invalid.\n\nAlternatively, shorten Nancy's meeting. But the minimum is 90 minutes. So we can't. So this approach won't work.\n\nSo starting with Nancy seems necessary.\n\nAnother idea: After meeting Nancy, go to Andrew first, then Lisa.\n\nLet's see:\n\nNancy: 9:11 AM -10:41 AM.\n\nTravel to Andrew's location (Pacific Heights to Nob Hill: 8 minutes). Arrive 10:49 AM. But Andrew is available from 11:30 AM. So have to wait until 11:30 AM. So meet Andrew from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM.\n\nThen travel to Lisa at Union Square. Nob Hill to Union Square is 7 minutes. Arrive 12:37 PM. Meet Lisa from 12:37 PM to 1:22 PM (45 minutes).\n\nThen travel to Joshua at Financial District. Union Square to Financial District is 9 minutes. Arrive 1:31 PM. Joshua is available until 3:15 PM. Meet from 1:31 PM to 1:46 PM (15 minutes).\n\nThen after that, plan for John and Kenneth.\n\nBut this schedule includes Nancy, Andrew, Lisa, Joshua. Then John and Kenneth. So again six friends. Let's check the timings:\n\nAfter Joshua ends at 1:46 PM, next is John from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM. Travel time from Financial District to Bayview is 19 minutes. Arrive 2:05 PM, but John's not available until 4:45 PM. So wait until 4:45 PM. Then meet until 6:00 PM. Then travel to Kenneth: 25 minutes to Richmond District, arrive 6:25 PM. Wait until 9:15 PM. Meet Kenneth until 9:45 PM.\n\nThis schedule also includes six friends but with the same long waits.\n\nSo in this case, the problem is that meeting John and Kenneth requires significant waiting time. But if the goal is to meet as many friends as possible, even with waiting, then six friends is the maximum.\n\nBut is there a way to meet all six without such long waits?\n\nAlternative idea: After meeting Joshua at 1:11 PM, perhaps meet John earlier by adjusting his meeting time. But John's available from 4:45 PM. So no.\n\nWait, John's available from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM. So the earliest possible meeting is 4:45 PM. So any earlier is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way to include John and Kenneth is to have the long waits. But the problem says \"optimize the schedule\" considering travel times and constraints. Maybe the optimal schedule is to meet six friends, despite the waits, as it's the maximum possible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let's check another approach.\n\nAnother plan:\n\nStart at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM.\n\n1. Meet Lisa first. Embarcadero to Union Square: 10 minutes. Arrive 9:10 AM. Meet from 9:10 AM to 9:55 AM (45 minutes).\n\n2. Then go to Nancy at Pacific Heights. Union Square to Pacific Heights: 15 minutes. Arrive 10:10 AM. Meet from 10:10 AM to 11:40 AM (90 minutes). But Nancy's available until 11:30 AM. So this ends at 11:40 AM, which is 10 minutes over. Not possible. So invalid.\n\nAlternative: Meet Lisa from 9:10 AM to 9:55 AM. Then go to Nancy, arriving at 10:10 AM. Meet until 11:30 AM (exactly 1 hour 20 minutes, but Nancy needs 90 minutes. So this is insufficient. So can't do.\n\nThus, starting with Lisa first isn't feasible due to Nancy's time constraints.\n\nSo the initial plan of starting with Nancy seems unavoidable.\n\nAnother plan: Meet Joshua first. But Joshua is available from 12 PM. So after arriving at 9 AM, the user can't meet Joshua until 12 PM. So not optimal.\n\nAnother approach: Meet Andrew first. Andrew is available from 11:30 AM. But the user starts at 9 AM. So can't meet Andrew until 11:30 AM.\n\nSo the best initial meeting is Nancy, followed by Lisa, Andrew, Joshua, John, and Kenneth, even with the long waits. This allows meeting all six friends.\n\nBut the problem is the waiting times. However, the instructions say to optimize for as many friends as possible. So even with waiting, this is the optimal solution.\n\nNow, verifying all travel times and meeting durations:\n\n1. Embarcadero to Pacific Heights: 11 minutes. Arrive 9:11 AM. Meet Nancy from 9:11 AM to 10:41 AM (90 minutes).\n\n2. Pacific Heights to Union Square: 12 minutes. Arrive 10:53 AM. Meet Lisa from 10:53 AM to 11:38 AM (45 minutes).\n\n3. Union Square to Nob Hill: 9 minutes. Arrive 11:47 AM. Meet Andrew from 11:47 AM to 12:47 PM (60 minutes).\n\n4. Nob Hill to Financial District: 9 minutes. Arrive 12:56 PM. Meet Joshua from 12:56 PM to 1:11 PM (15 minutes).\n\n5. Financial District to Bayview: 19 minutes. Arrive 1:30 PM. Wait until 4:45 PM. Meet John from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM (75 minutes).\n\n6. Bayview to Richmond District: 25 minutes. Arrive 6:25 PM. Wait until 9:15 PM. Meet Kenneth from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM (30 minutes).\n\nAll meetings meet the minimum duration requirements and are within the friends' availability. The travel times are correctly accounted for.\n\nThis schedule includes all six friends. Therefore, this is the optimal solution.",
