    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule meets all three friends while respecting the minimum meeting times and travel constraints. Starting at Bayview at 9:00 AM, the itinerary involves traveling to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Jason first, then to Embarcadero to meet Jessica, and finally to Richmond District to meet Sandra. The meeting times are scheduled to minimize waiting and ensure all minimum meeting durations are satisfied.  \n\n- Jason is met from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM (30 minutes) at Fisherman's Wharf, within his availability window (4:00 PM to 4:45 PM).  \n- Jessica is met from 4:45 PM to 6:09 PM (84 minutes) at Embarcadero, within her availability window (4:45 PM to 7:00 PM), exceeding the minimum 30 minutes.  \n- Sandra is met from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM (120 minutes) at Richmond District, within her availability window (6:30 PM to 9:45 PM), satisfying the minimum 120 minutes.  \n\nTravel times:  \n- Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf: 25 minutes, departing Bayview at 3:35 PM to arrive at 4:00 PM.  \n- Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero: 8 minutes, departing at 4:30 PM to arrive at 4:38 PM, with a 7-minute wait until Jessica's availability at 4:45 PM.  \n- Embarcadero to Richmond District: 21 minutes, departing at 6:09 PM to arrive at 6:30 PM just in time for Sandra.  \n\nThis schedule meets all friends with no overlap, adheres to the constraints, and minimizes unnecessary waiting by leveraging the proximity between Fisherman's Wharf and Embarcadero.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:09\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
