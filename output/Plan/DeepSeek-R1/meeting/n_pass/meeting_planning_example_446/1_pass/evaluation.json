    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nI have optimized the schedule to meet all five friends while respecting the minimum meeting durations and travel times. The itinerary starts from Richmond District at 9:00 AM. After considering various sequences, the best schedule minimizes idle time and ensures all meetings fit within the friends' availability windows. Travel times are accounted for between meetings, and meetings are scheduled to start as soon as possible after arrival, with buffer for punctuality.  \n\nThe final itinerary in JSON format is:  \n\n{\"itinerary\": [  \n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Margaret\", \"start_time\": \"9:30AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:00AM\"},  \n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"12:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"12:30PM\"},  \n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Rebecca\", \"start_time\": \"1:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:30PM\"},  \n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kimberly\", \"start_time\": \"2:47PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:02PM\"},  \n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"7:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:45PM\"}  \n]}  \n\n### Explanation of the Schedule:\n- **Margaret at Bayview (9:30AM\u201310:00AM)**: Depart Richmond at 9:00AM (26 min travel), arrive 9:26AM, wait until 9:30AM to start the 30-minute meeting.\n- **Robert at Chinatown (12:15PM\u201312:30PM)**: Depart Bayview at 11:57AM (18 min travel), arrive 12:15PM for a 15-minute meeting.\n- **Rebecca at Financial District (1:15PM\u20132:30PM)**: Depart Chinatown at 1:10PM (5 min travel), arrive 1:15PM for a 75-minute meeting.\n- **Kimberly at Marina District (2:47PM\u20133:02PM)**: Depart Financial District at 2:30PM (17 min travel), arrive 2:47PM for a 15-minute meeting.\n- **Kenneth at Union Square (7:30PM\u20138:45PM)**: Depart Marina District at 7:14PM (16 min travel), arrive 7:30PM for a 75-minute meeting.\n\nIdle time is minimized and occurs between meetings (e.g., after Kimberly until departure for Kenneth), but all friends are met within their windows and minimum durations. Travel times are based on the provided matrix and are consistent (e.g., Financial District to Marina District is 17 minutes). This schedule meets all five friends, which is the maximum possible.",
