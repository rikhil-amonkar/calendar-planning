    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: I have considered various schedules to meet as many friends as possible while respecting the constraints and minimum meeting times. The optimal schedule allows me to meet all five friends: Margaret, Robert, Rebecca, Kimberly, and Kenneth. The key is to minimize waiting time and travel time by sequencing meetings based on availability windows and proximity. \n\n- Start at Richmond District at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Bayview (26 minutes) to meet Margaret first, as she has an early window. Meet from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM (30 minutes, meeting the 30-minute minimum).\n- Travel to Chinatown (18 minutes from Bayview) to meet Robert at the start of his availability. Meet from 12:15 PM to 12:30 PM (15 minutes, meeting the 15-minute minimum).\n- Travel to Financial District (5 minutes from Chinatown) for Rebecca, starting at her availability time. Meet from 1:15 PM to 2:30 PM (75 minutes, meeting the 75-minute minimum).\n- Travel to Marina District (15 minutes from Financial District) to meet Kimberly. Meet from 2:45 PM to 3:00 PM (15 minutes, meeting the 15-minute minimum within her window).\n- Travel to Union Square (16 minutes from Marina District) to meet Kenneth at his start time. Meet from 7:30 PM to 8:45 PM (75 minutes, meeting the 75-minute minimum and ending before his 9:15 PM end).\n\nThis schedule accounts for all travel times and ensures meetings occur within the friends' availability windows. The free time from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM is used for rest or flexible activities, but no other meetings are scheduled as all friends are already covered.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:30 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:00 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"12:30 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:30 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:00 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:45 PM\"}]}",
