    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nI have considered multiple schedules to meet as many friends as possible while respecting the minimum meeting times, availability constraints, and travel times. After evaluating different sequences, I determined that it is possible to meet all four friends: Betty, Mary, Charles, and Lisa. The optimal schedule minimizes conflicts and idle time where possible, though some idle time is unavoidable due to Lisa's late availability.\n\nThe chosen schedule is as follows:\n1. Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Haight-Ashbury (19 minutes), arriving at 9:19 AM to meet Betty.\n3. Meet Betty for 90 minutes from 9:19 AM to 10:49 AM (within her availability from 7:15 AM to 5:15 PM).\n4. Travel to Pacific Heights (12 minutes), arriving at 11:01 AM to meet Mary.\n5. Meet Mary for 45 minutes from 11:01 AM to 11:46 AM (within her availability from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM).\n6. Travel to Financial District (13 minutes), arriving at 11:59 AM to meet Charles.\n7. Meet Charles for 120 minutes from 11:59 AM to 1:59 PM (within his availability from 11:15 AM to 3:00 PM; ends at 1:59 PM, before 3:00 PM).\n8. Remain at Financial District or move to Mission District later (idle time from 1:59 PM to departure for Lisa).\n9. Travel to Mission District (17 minutes), departing Financial District at 8:13 PM to arrive at 8:30 PM for Lisa.\n10. Meet Lisa for 75 minutes from 8:30 PM to 9:45 PM (within her availability from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM; ends at 9:45 PM, before 10:00 PM).\n\nThis schedule meets all minimum time requirements and availability constraints. The itinerary in JSON format includes only the meeting actions, as specified.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Betty\", \"start_time\": \"09:19 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:49 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"11:01 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:46 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Charles\", \"start_time\": \"11:59 AM\", \"end_time\": \"01:59 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Lisa\", \"start_time\": \"08:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"09:45 PM\"}]}",
