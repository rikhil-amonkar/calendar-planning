    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo maximize the number of friends met, the optimal schedule involves meeting Patricia, Laura, Ronald, and Emily, skipping Mary due to a time conflict between Ronald and Mary that cannot be resolved given their availability windows and travel times. The schedule is as follows:  \n\n- Start at the Financial District at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel to Sunset District (31 minutes) to meet Patricia from 9:31 AM to 10:31 AM (60 minutes).  \n- Travel to North Beach (29 minutes, departing Sunset District at 12:01 PM to arrive at 12:30 PM) to meet Laura from 12:30 PM to 12:45 PM (15 minutes).  \n- Travel to Russian Hill (4 minutes) to arrive at 12:49 PM; wait until Ronald is available. Meet Ronald from 1:45 PM to 3:30 PM (105 minutes).  \n- Travel to The Castro (21 minutes) to arrive at 3:51 PM; wait until Emily is available. Meet Emily from 4:15 PM to 5:15 PM (60 minutes).  \n\nThis schedule meets four friends and accounts for all travel times and constraints. Mary is not met due to the conflict with Ronald's longer meeting requirement and travel time, which prevents meeting both within their available windows.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Day 1\", \"start_time\": \"09:31\", \"end_time\": \"10:31\"}, {\"day\": \"Day 1\", \"start_time\": \"12:30\", \"end_time\": \"12:45\"}, {\"day\": \"Day 1\", \"start_time\": \"13:45\", \"end_time\": \"15:30\"}, {\"day\": \"Day 1\", \"start_time\": \"16:15\", \"end_time\": \"17:15\"}]}",
