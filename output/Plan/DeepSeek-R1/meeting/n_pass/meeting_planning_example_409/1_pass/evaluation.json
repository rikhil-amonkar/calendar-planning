    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nI have optimized the schedule to meet all five friends while respecting the time constraints and minimizing travel time. The schedule starts at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM, and meetings are arranged in chronological order. Key decisions:\n- Meet Laura first at Nob Hill since it is close to the starting point and her availability starts early.\n- Meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM at Bayview to fulfill the 120-minute requirement within his window.\n- Meet Patricia next at Embarcadero, arriving shortly after her start time due to travel.\n- Meet Stephanie at Golden Gate Park, then Betty at Marina District, as this sequence minimizes travel time between locations.\n\nTravel times are accounted for between meetings, and all minimum meeting durations are satisfied. The day is labeled as \"1\" for simplicity.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:11\", \"end_time\": \"09:41\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"17:30\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:49\", \"end_time\": \"18:34\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:59\", \"end_time\": \"19:29\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:45\", \"end_time\": \"20:30\"}]}",
