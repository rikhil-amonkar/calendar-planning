        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nTo maximize the number of friends met, the optimal schedule involves meeting Kimberly, Brian, Kenneth, Joshua, Betty, Melissa, and Barbara. This schedule meets 7 friends while respecting all constraints and minimum meeting durations. The conflicts prevent meeting Joseph (due to overlap with Joshua) and Steven (due to overlap with Betty). The schedule starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM and efficiently sequences meetings to minimize travel time and waiting, with meeting times adjusted to fit within availability windows and travel durations.\n\n**Meeting Schedule in JSON Format:**  \n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:10\", \"end_time\": \"09:25\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:30\", \"end_time\": \"12:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:15\", \"end_time\": \"16:13\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"16:30\", \"end_time\": \"18:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:00\", \"end_time\": \"20:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"20:36\", \"end_time\": \"21:06\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"21:14\", \"end_time\": \"21:29\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Schedule:**  \n- **Kimberly at North Beach (09:10\u201309:25):** Arrive at 9:10 AM after 10 min travel from Union Square. Meet for 15 min (minimum met) within her 7:00 AM\u201310:30 AM window.  \n- **Brian at Fisherman's Wharf (09:30\u201312:00):** Arrive at 9:30 AM after 5 min travel from North Beach. Meet for 150 min (exceeds minimum 45 min) within his 9:30 AM\u20133:30 PM window.  \n- **Kenneth at Nob Hill (12:15\u201316:13):** Arrive at 12:15 PM after 11 min travel from Fisherman's Wharf. Meet for 238 min (exceeds minimum 105 min) within his 12:15 PM\u20135:15 PM window. End time allows for travel to Presidio.  \n- **Joshua at Presidio (16:30\u201318:15):** Arrive at 4:30 PM after 17 min travel from Nob Hill. Meet for exactly 105 min (minimum met) within his 4:30 PM\u20136:15 PM window.  \n- **Betty at Haight-Ashbury (19:00\u201320:30):** Arrive at 7:00 PM after 15 min travel from Presidio and 30 min wait. Meet for exactly 90 min (minimum met) within her 7:00 PM\u20138:30 PM window.  \n- **Melissa at The Castro (20:36\u201321:06):** Arrive at 8:36 PM after 6 min travel from Haight-Ashbury. Meet for 30 min (minimum met) within her 8:15 PM\u20139:15 PM window.  \n- **Barbara at Alamo Square (21:14\u201321:29):** Arrive at 9:14 PM after 8 min travel from The Castro. Meet for 15 min (minimum met) within her 8:45 PM\u20139:45 PM window.  \n\n**Why this schedule is optimal:**  \n- **7 friends met:** Maximizes the number given constraints (Joseph and Steven cannot be included without violating minimum times or availability).  \n- **Travel minimized:** Sequence leverages short travel times (e.g., North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: 5 min; Haight-Ashbury to The Castro: 6 min).  \n- **Waiting minimized:** Brief waits (e.g., 30 min before Betty) are unavoidable but reduced by extending meetings (e.g., Brian and Kenneth).  \n- **All minimums met:** Each meeting satisfies the minimum duration within the friend's availability.  \n\n**Friends not met:**  \n- Joseph: Conflicts with Joshua; meeting Joseph for 75 min would require time overlapping with Joshua's fixed 4:30\u20136:15 PM window, and travel makes it impossible.  \n- Steven: Conflicts with Betty; meeting Steven would require skipping Betty, Melissa, and Barbara, reducing total meetings."
