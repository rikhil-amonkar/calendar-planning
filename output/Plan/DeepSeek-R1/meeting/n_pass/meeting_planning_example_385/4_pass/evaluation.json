    "execution_output": "After reviewing the time format constraints, I adjusted the schedule to represent all minutes in two-digit format without leading zeros (e.g., \"9:15 AM\" instead of \"9:08 AM\"). The revised schedule meets John, Steven, and Barbara while fully respecting their minimum meeting times, travel constraints, and availability windows. Jeffrey is skipped because his minimum time requirement cannot be satisfied.\n\n**Revised Schedule:**\n1. **John at Pacific Heights:**  \n   - Travel from Nob Hill (9:00 AM) takes 8 minutes \u2192 arrive at 9:08 AM.  \n   - Meeting: 9:15 AM to 1:20 PM (245 minutes, exceeds 15-minute minimum).  \n   - Depart at 1:20 PM \u2192 arrive at North Beach at 1:29 PM (9-minute travel), then wait 1 minute.\n\n2. **Steven at North Beach:**  \n   - Meeting: 1:30 PM to 5:55 PM (265 minutes, exceeds 45-minute minimum).  \n   - Depart at 5:55 PM \u2192 arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 6:00 PM (5-minute travel).\n\n3. **Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf:**  \n   - Meeting: 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM (exactly 30-minute minimum).  \n\n**Key Adjustments:**\n- John's start time shifted to 9:15 AM (from 9:08 AM) to avoid single-digit minutes in the time string.\n- John's end time adjusted to 1:20 PM (from 1:21 PM) to maintain consistent two-digit minute formatting.\n- Total meeting time with John remains well above the 15-minute minimum (245 minutes).\n\nThis schedule meets all constraints for the three friends and adheres to the required time format.\n\nSOLUTION:\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:15 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:20 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:30 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"5:55 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"6:00 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"6:30 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
