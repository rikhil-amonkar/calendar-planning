    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nThe optimal schedule meets all four friends, maximizing the number of friends met, though the minimum time for Jeffrey is not fully met due to his limited availability. The schedule accounts for travel times to ensure arrivals at each location align with the friends' availability windows. Jeffrey is met first for the maximum possible time (43 minutes, less than the desired 105 minutes), followed by John, Steven, and Barbara, all of whom are met for at least their minimum times. The meetings are scheduled on the same day, denoted as day \"1\".\n\n- Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Presidio (17 minutes) to meet Jeffrey from 9:17 AM to 10:00 AM (43 minutes).\n- Travel to Pacific Heights (11 minutes) to meet John from 10:11 AM to 1:21 PM (190 minutes, exceeding the 15-minute minimum).\n- Travel to North Beach (9 minutes) to meet Steven from 1:30 PM to 5:55 PM (265 minutes, exceeding the 45-minute minimum).\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (5 minutes) to meet Barbara from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM (30 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n\nThis schedule ensures three friends (John, Steven, Barbara) meet or exceed their minimum time, while Jeffrey is met for the available time, allowing all four friends to be met in one day.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:17 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:00 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:11 AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:21 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:55 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:30 PM\"}]}",
