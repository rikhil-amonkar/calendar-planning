    "execution_output": "The constraints require meeting Jeffrey for a minimum of 105 minutes, but his availability (8:00 AM to 10:00 AM) combined with the 17-minute travel time from Nob Hill to Presidio limits the meeting to 43 minutes (9:17 AM to 10:00 AM). This constraint is impossible to satisfy fully. However, the schedule maximizes the meeting time with Jeffrey while meeting all other constraints:\n\n- **Jeffrey (Presidio)**: Met for the maximum possible 43 minutes (9:17 AM to 10:00 AM).\n- **John (Pacific Heights)**: Met for 190 minutes (10:11 AM to 1:21 PM), exceeding the 15-minute minimum.\n- **Steven (North Beach)**: Met for 265 minutes (1:30 PM to 5:55 PM), exceeding the 45-minute minimum.\n- **Barbara (Fisherman's Wharf)**: Met for 30 minutes (6:00 PM to 6:30 PM), meeting the minimum.\n\nTravel times are accounted for:\n- Nob Hill to Presidio: 17 minutes (9:00 AM \u2192 9:17 AM).\n- Presidio to Pacific Heights: 11 minutes (10:00 AM \u2192 10:11 AM).\n- Pacific Heights to North Beach: 9 minutes (1:21 PM \u2192 1:30 PM).\n- North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: 5 minutes (5:55 PM \u2192 6:00 PM).\n\nThis schedule meets all four friends, adheres to travel times, and satisfies minimum meeting durations for John, Steven, and Barbara. Jeffrey\u2019s time is maximized given his availability.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:17 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:00 AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:11 AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:21 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:55 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:30 PM\"}\n]}",
