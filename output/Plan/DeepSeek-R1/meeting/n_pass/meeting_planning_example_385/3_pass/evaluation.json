    "has_execution_error": false,
    "execution_output": "After reevaluating the constraints, I recognize that meeting Jeffrey for the required 105 minutes is impossible given his availability window (8:00 AM to 10:00 AM) and our 9:00 AM arrival at Nob Hill. Since we cannot satisfy this constraint, we must skip Jeffrey to focus on meeting other friends while fully honoring all minimum time requirements. The optimal schedule meets John, Steven, and Barbara while respecting travel times and availability windows.\n\n**Revised Schedule:**\n1. **John at Pacific Heights:**  \n   - Travel from Nob Hill (9:00 AM) takes 8 minutes.  \n   - Meeting: 9:08 AM to 1:21 PM (253 minutes, exceeds 15-minute minimum).  \n   - Depart Pacific Heights at 1:21 PM to reach North Beach by 1:30 PM (9-minute travel).\n\n2. **Steven at North Beach:**  \n   - Arrive at 1:30 PM.  \n   - Meeting: 1:30 PM to 5:55 PM (265 minutes, exceeds 45-minute minimum).  \n   - Depart North Beach at 5:55 PM to reach Fisherman's Wharf by 6:00 PM (5-minute travel).\n\n3. **Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf:**  \n   - Arrive at 6:00 PM.  \n   - Meeting: 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM (exactly 30-minute minimum).  \n\nThis schedule meets three friends (John, Steven, Barbara) without violating any constraints.\n\nSOLUTION:\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:08 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:21 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:30 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"5:55 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"6:00 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"6:30 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
