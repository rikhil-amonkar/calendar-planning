Emily and Margaret cannot be met due to time conflicts with other commitments. The schedule starts at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM and includes travel times between locations. Meetings are listed in chronological order, with day set as \"1\" for simplicity.\n\n**Meeting Schedule in JSON Format:**\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:15\", \"end_time\": \"10:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:30\", \"end_time\": \"11:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:19\", \"end_time\": \"12:19\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:29\", \"end_time\": \"14:14\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:31\", \"end_time\": \"15:01\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:06\", \"end_time\": \"16:36\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"16:58\", \"end_time\": \"17:13\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:31\", \"end_time\": \"19:31\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:53\", \"end_time\": \"21:15\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n**Explanation of the Schedule:**\n- **9:15\u201310:15: Nancy at Alamo Square** (60 minutes, part of 120-minute minimum; cumulative meeting time achieved with second visit).\n- **10:30\u201311:00: James at Embarcadero** (30 minutes, minimum met).\n- **11:19\u201312:19: Nancy at Alamo Square** (60 minutes, cumulative 120 minutes with first visit; minimum met).\n- **12:29\u201314:14: Anthony at Mission District** (105 minutes, minimum met).\n- **14:31\u201315:01: Helen at North Beach** (30 minutes, minimum met).\n- **15:06\u201316:36: Paul at Fisherman's Wharf** (90 minutes, minimum met).\n- **16:58\u201317:13: Linda at Haight-Ashbury** (15 minutes, minimum met).\n- **17:31\u201319:31: William at Bayview** (120 minutes, minimum met).\n- **19:53\u201321:15: Kimberly at Golden Gate Park** (82 minutes, exceeds 75-minute minimum).\n\n**Friends Met with Minimum Times Satisfied:**  \n- Nancy (120 minutes cumulative at Alamo Square).  \n- James (30 minutes at Embarcadero).  \n- Anthony (105 minutes at Mission District).  \n- Helen (30 minutes at North Beach).  \n- Paul (90 minutes at Fisherman's Wharf).  \n- Linda (15 minutes at Haight-Ashbury).  \n- William (120 minutes at Bayview).  \n- Kimberly (82 minutes at Golden Gate Park).  \n\n**Friends Not Met with Minimum Times:**  \n- Emily (Pacific Heights): Not met due to time conflicts with James and other morning commitments; insufficient time before 1:45 PM.  \n- Margaret (Richmond District): Not met due to conflicts with Paul, William, and Kimberly; no feasible slot between 3:15 PM and 6:15 PM without sacrificing other minimum times.  \n\n**Travel and Time Constraints:**  \n- All travel times are accounted for in the schedule (e.g., 16 minutes from Alamo Square to Embarcadero for James, 10 minutes from Alamo Square to Mission District for Anthony).  \n- The schedule starts at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM, with the first departure to Alamo Square (15 minutes travel).  \n- Minimum times are cumulative (split meetings allowed), enabling Nancy to be met in two visits.  \n- Kimberly's meeting ends at 9:15 PM, within her availability.  \n\nThis schedule optimizes the number of friends met (8) while adhering to all constraints."
