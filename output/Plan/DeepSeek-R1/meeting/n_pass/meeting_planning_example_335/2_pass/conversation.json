The evening conflict between Betty and Amanda makes meeting all four impossible within their time windows and minimum meeting durations. The revised schedule maximizes meetings while respecting all constraints:\n\n1. **Helen at North Beach**: Met from 9:09 AM to 10:27 AM (78 minutes, exceeding the 15-minute minimum).  \n   - Travel from Pacific Heights to North Beach takes 9 minutes (arrive at 9:09 AM).  \n   - Helen is available until 5:00 PM, allowing a flexible meeting window.  \n\n2. **Kevin at Mission District**: Met from 10:45 AM to 11:30 AM (45 minutes, meeting the minimum).  \n   - Travel from North Beach to Mission District takes 18 minutes (leave at 10:27 AM, arrive at 10:45 AM).  \n   - Kevin's window (10:45 AM to 2:45 PM) is fully respected.  \n\n3. **Amanda at Alamo Square**: Met from 7:45 PM to 8:45 PM (60 minutes, meeting the minimum).  \n   - Travel from Mission District to Alamo Square takes 11 minutes (leave at 7:34 PM, arrive at 7:45 PM).  \n   - Amanda's window (7:45 PM to 9:00 PM) accommodates the meeting.  \n\n**Why Betty cannot be included**:  \n- Betty requires 90 minutes (7:00 PM to 8:30 PM) and Amanda requires 60 minutes (7:45 PM to 8:45 PM), but their windows overlap.  \n- Travel between Financial District and Alamo Square takes 17 minutes. Attempting both would violate one friend's minimum meeting time (e.g., meeting Betty first leaves only 13 minutes for Amanda; meeting Amanda first leaves only 43 minutes for Betty).  \n\n**Travel validation**:  \n- Pacific Heights \u2192 North Beach: 9 minutes (on time for Helen).  \n- North Beach \u2192 Mission District: 18 minutes (on time for Kevin).  \n- Mission District \u2192 Alamo Square: 11 minutes (on time for Amanda).  \n\nThis schedule meets three friends, which is the maximum possible given the constraints.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:09AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:27AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:30AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:45PM\"}]}"
