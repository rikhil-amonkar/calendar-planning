    "execution_output": "After re-evaluating the constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule meets three friends: Kevin, Helen, and Betty. The evening conflict between Betty and Amanda makes meeting all four impossible within their time windows and minimum meeting durations. The revised schedule maximizes meetings while respecting all constraints by adjusting Helen's meeting duration to the minimum required 15 minutes and optimizing the sequence to ensure all travel times are properly accounted for.\n\n**Revised Schedule:**\n1. **Kevin at Mission District**: Met from 10:45 AM to 11:30 AM (45 minutes, meeting his minimum).  \n   - Travel from Pacific Heights (start at 9:00 AM) takes 15 minutes. Arrive at 9:15 AM and wait until Kevin's availability begins at 10:45 AM (idle time allowed).  \n   - Kevin's window (10:45 AM to 2:45 PM) is fully respected.  \n\n2. **Helen at North Beach**: Met from 11:48 AM to 12:03 PM (15 minutes, meeting her minimum).  \n   - Travel from Mission District to North Beach takes 18 minutes. Leave at 11:30 AM, arrive at 11:48 AM.  \n   - Helen's window (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM) accommodates the meeting.  \n\n3. **Betty at Financial District**: Met from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM (90 minutes, meeting her minimum).  \n   - Travel from North Beach to Financial District takes 8 minutes. Leave at 6:52 PM, arrive at 7:00 PM.  \n   - Betty's window (7:00 PM to 9:45 PM) is fully respected.  \n\n**Why Amanda cannot be included**:  \n- Betty requires 90 minutes (7:00 PM to 8:30 PM) and Amanda requires 60 minutes (7:45 PM to 8:45 PM), but their windows overlap.  \n- Travel between Financial District and Alamo Square takes 17 minutes. Attempting both would violate one friend's minimum meeting time (e.g., meeting Betty first leaves only 13 minutes for Amanda; meeting Amanda first leaves only 43 minutes for Betty).  \n\n**Travel Validation**:  \n- Pacific Heights \u2192 Mission District: 15 minutes (arrive at 9:15 AM).  \n- Mission District \u2192 North Beach: 18 minutes (arrive at 11:48 AM).  \n- North Beach \u2192 Financial District: 8 minutes (arrive at 7:00 PM).  \n\nThis schedule meets three friends while fully satisfying all constraints and minimum meeting durations.\n\nSOLUTION:\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:45AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:48AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:03PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"7:00PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"8:30PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
