    "execution_output": "After re-evaluating the constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule meets three friends: Helen, Kevin, and Betty. The evening conflict between Betty and Amanda makes meeting all four impossible within their time windows and minimum meeting durations. The revised schedule maximizes meetings while respecting all constraints:\n\n1. **Helen at North Beach**: Met from 9:09 AM to 10:27 AM (78 minutes, exceeding the 15-minute minimum).  \n   - Travel from Pacific Heights to North Beach takes 9 minutes (arrive at 9:09 AM).  \n   - Helen is available until 5:00 PM, allowing a flexible meeting window.  \n\n2. **Kevin at Mission District**: Met from 10:45 AM to 11:30 AM (45 minutes, meeting the minimum).  \n   - Travel from North Beach to Mission District takes 18 minutes (leave at 10:27 AM, arrive at 10:45 AM).  \n   - Kevin's window (10:45 AM to 2:45 PM) is fully respected.  \n\n3. **Betty at Financial District**: Met from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM (90 minutes, meeting the minimum).  \n   - Travel from Mission District to Financial District takes 17 minutes (leave at 6:43 PM, arrive at 7:00 PM).  \n   - Betty's window (7:00 PM to 9:45 PM) accommodates the meeting.  \n\n**Why Amanda cannot be included**:  \n- Betty requires 90 minutes (7:00 PM to 8:30 PM) and Amanda requires 60 minutes (7:45 PM to 8:45 PM), but their windows overlap.  \n- Travel between Financial District and Alamo Square takes 17 minutes. Attempting both would violate one friend's minimum meeting time (e.g., meeting Betty first leaves only 13 minutes for Amanda; meeting Amanda first leaves only 43 minutes for Betty).  \n\n**Travel validation**:  \n- Pacific Heights \u2192 North Beach: 9 minutes (on time for Helen).  \n- North Beach \u2192 Mission District: 18 minutes (on time for Kevin).  \n- Mission District \u2192 Financial District: 17 minutes (on time for Betty).  \n\nThis schedule meets three friends while fully satisfying all constraints and minimum meeting durations.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:09AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:27AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:30AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:30PM\"}]}",
