    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: I can meet three friends: Kevin, Helen, and Betty. Meeting all four friends is impossible due to the time conflict between Betty and Amanda in the evening, as the minimum meeting times and travel time between Financial District and Alamo Square exceed the available window. Specifically, the combined minimum meeting time of 150 minutes (90 for Betty and 60 for Amanda) plus the 17-minute travel time totals 167 minutes, but only 165 minutes are available from 7:00 PM to 9:45 PM. Therefore, I must choose one evening friend; I selected Betty to minimize travel time from North Beach (where I meet Helen) to Financial District.\n\nThe optimal schedule is:\n- Meet Kevin at Mission District from 10:45 AM to 11:30 AM (45 minutes, within his 10:45 AM to 2:45 PM availability).\n- Meet Helen at North Beach from 11:47 AM to 12:02 PM (15 minutes, within her 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM availability).\n- Meet Betty at Financial District from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM (90 minutes, within her 7:00 PM to 9:45 PM availability).\n\nTravel details:\n- From Pacific Heights (start at 9:00 AM), leave at 10:30 AM to arrive at Mission District by 10:45 AM (15-minute travel).\n- After meeting Kevin, leave Mission District at 11:30 AM to arrive at North Beach by 11:47 AM (17-minute travel).\n- After meeting Helen, leave North Beach at 6:52 PM to arrive at Financial District by 7:00 PM (8-minute travel).\n- Amanda is not met due to the evening conflict.\n\nThis schedule meets the minimum time requirements for three friends and minimizes idle time.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:30AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:47AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:02PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:30PM\"}]}",
