    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: After evaluating various schedules to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints and minimum meeting times, the optimal schedule allows meeting three friends: Helen, Kevin, and Amanda. Meeting both Betty and Amanda in the evening is impossible due to conflicting availabilities and travel times, as the minimum meeting times cannot be satisfied when accounting for the 17-minute travel between Financial District and Alamo Square. Helen and Kevin are met during the day with no idle time by extending the meeting with Helen to avoid waiting for Kevin. Amanda is chosen for the evening meeting over Betty because the travel time from Mission District (where Kevin is met) to Alamo Square is shorter (11 minutes vs. 17 minutes to Financial District), though both options result in meeting three friends. The meeting with Helen exceeds the minimum 15 minutes, Kevin meets the minimum 45 minutes, and Amanda meets the minimum 60 minutes.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Helen\", \"start_time\": \"9:09 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:27 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kevin\", \"start_time\": \"10:45 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:30 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Amanda\", \"start_time\": \"7:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:45 PM\"}]}",
