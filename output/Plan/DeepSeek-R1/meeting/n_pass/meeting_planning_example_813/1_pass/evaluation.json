    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nThe optimal schedule allows meeting 8 friends while respecting all constraints and minimum meeting durations. Elizabeth cannot be met because the travel time from Marina District to Sunset District (19 minutes) results in arrival at 9:19 AM, leaving only 26 minutes before her availability ends at 9:45 AM, which is less than the required 45 minutes. The schedule below meets Joshua, Jeffrey, Charles, Joseph, Matthew, Carol, Paul, and Rebecca, with travel times accounted for between meetings.\n\nThe meeting schedule in the specified JSON format is:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:15AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:15AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:00AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:09AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:09PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:20PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:05PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"3:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:15PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:38PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:53PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:06PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:51PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:30PM\"}]}\n\n### Explanation of the Schedule:\n- **9:15 AM to 10:15 AM: Meet Joseph at Chinatown**  \n  Start at Marina District at 9:00 AM, travel to Chinatown (15 min), arrive at 9:15 AM. Meet for exactly 60 minutes (minimum required).\n\n- **10:45 AM to 11:00 AM: Meet Carol at Financial District**  \n  Travel from Chinatown to Financial District (5 min), arrive at 10:20 AM. Wait until Carol's availability starts at 10:45 AM. Meet for 15 minutes (minimum required).\n\n- **11:09 AM to 1:09 PM: Meet Charles at Union Square**  \n  Travel from Financial District to Union Square (9 min), arrive at 11:09 AM. Meet for 120 minutes (minimum required).\n\n- **1:20 PM to 3:05 PM: Meet Joshua at Embarcadero**  \n  Travel from Union Square to Embarcadero (11 min), arrive at 1:20 PM. Meet for 105 minutes (minimum required).\n\n- **3:30 PM to 4:15 PM: Meet Matthew at Golden Gate Park**  \n  Travel from Embarcadero to Golden Gate Park (25 min), arrive at 3:30 PM. Meet for 45 minutes (minimum required).\n\n- **4:38 PM to 5:53 PM: Meet Jeffrey at Bayview**  \n  Travel from Golden Gate Park to Bayview (23 min), arrive at 4:38 PM. Meet for 75 minutes (minimum required).\n\n- **6:06 PM to 6:51 PM: Meet Rebecca at Mission District**  \n  Travel from Bayview to Mission District (13 min), arrive at 6:06 PM. Meet for 45 minutes (minimum required).\n\n- **7:15 PM to 7:30 PM: Meet Paul at Haight-Ashbury**  \n  Travel from Mission District to Haight-Ashbury (12 min), arrive at 7:03 PM. Wait until Paul's availability starts at 7:15 PM. Meet for 15 minutes (minimum required).\n\n### Key Notes:\n- **Total Friends Met**: 8 out of 9 (Elizabeth excluded due to time constraints).\n- **Travel and Waiting**: Incorporated between meetings; no meetings occur during travel or waiting periods.\n- **Efficiency**: The schedule groups meetings geographically where possible (e.g., central districts like Chinatown, Financial District, Union Square, and Embarcadero are handled consecutively in the morning, followed by peripheral districts later).\n- **Constraint Adherence**: All minimum meeting times are met exactly or within availability windows, and start times respect travel delays. For example:\n  - Charles starts slightly after his availability begins (10:45 AM) due to travel, but this is within his window.\n  - Rebecca starts after 5:00 PM but within her availability.\n- **Day Specification**: The day is set to \"1\" as a placeholder since the problem does not specify a date.",
