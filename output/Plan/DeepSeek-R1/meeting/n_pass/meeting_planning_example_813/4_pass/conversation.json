Meet for 120 minutes (minimum required).\n\n- **1:20 PM to 3:05 PM: Meet Joshua at Embarcadero**  \n  Travel from Union Square to Embarcadero (11 min), arrive at 1:20 PM. Meet for 105 minutes (minimum required).\n\n- **3:30 PM to 4:15 PM: Meet Matthew at Golden Gate Park**  \n  Travel from Embarcadero to Golden Gate Park (25 min), arrive at 3:30 PM.
