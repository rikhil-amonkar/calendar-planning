    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nI considered multiple schedules to meet all three friends while minimizing travel time and ensuring all constraints are met. The optimal schedule meets Karen first thing in the morning since her availability ends at 3:00 PM, followed by Anthony for his 105-minute meeting, and ends with Betty in the evening during her availability window. Travel times are incorporated to ensure punctuality.\n\n- Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Financial District to meet Anthony first (19 minutes; arrive at 9:19 AM). Anthony is available from 9:15 AM, so this is feasible. Meet from 9:19 AM to 11:04 AM (105 minutes).\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (10 minutes; arrive at 11:14 AM). Meet Karen from 11:14 AM to 11:44 AM (30 minutes), well within her 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM window.\n- Remain at Fisherman's Wharf or explore until evening. Travel to Embarcadero for Betty (8 minutes; leave at 7:37 PM to arrive at 7:45 PM). Meet Betty from 7:45 PM to 8:00 PM (15 minutes), within her 7:45 PM to 9:45 PM availability.\n\nTotal travel time is 37 minutes, which is the minimum among considered schedules. All minimum meeting times are satisfied, and no availability windows are violated.\n\nJSON output:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:19 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:04 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:14 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:44 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"07:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"08:00 PM\"}]}",
