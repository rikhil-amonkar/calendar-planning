The optimal schedule meets Karen first thing in the morning since her availability ends at 3:00 PM, followed by Anthony for his 105-minute meeting, and ends with Betty in the evening during her availability window. Travel times are incorporated to ensure punctuality.\n\n- Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Financial District to meet Anthony first (19 minutes; arrive at 9:19 AM). Anthony is available from 9:15 AM, so this is feasible. Meet from 9:19 AM to 11:04 AM (105 minutes).\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (10 minutes; arrive at 11:14 AM). Meet Karen from 11:14 AM to 11:44 AM (30 minutes), well within her 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM window.\n- Remain at Fisherman's Wharf or explore until evening.
