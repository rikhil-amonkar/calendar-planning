Since no other friends or their availabilities are provided, the optimal schedule focuses solely on meeting Timothy for the required 45 minutes within his availability period. To meet Timothy at Richmond District from 8:45 PM to 9:30 PM, accounting for the 12-minute travel time from Alamo Square, you must depart Alamo Square at 8:33 PM. You start at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM and can potentially meet other friends there throughout the day, but without specific details, only the Timothy meeting is scheduled. The meeting with Timothy is fixed and cannot be adjusted due to the exact 45-minute availability matching the minimum requirement.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"08:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"09:30 PM\"}]}",
