    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nIt is impossible to meet Rebecca because she is only available from 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM, and you arrive at the Financial District at 9:00 AM, which is after her availability window. Therefore, the best schedule is to meet Nancy, Mary, and Jessica, as their meeting times and travel constraints allow for all three to be met within their availability windows and minimum meeting durations. The optimized schedule involves starting with Nancy in Chinatown (closest to your starting point), then traveling to Jessica in Bayview to meet within her tighter availability window, and finally meeting Mary in Alamo Square, as she has all-day availability.\n\nThe detailed schedule with meeting times, considering travel, is as follows:\n- Meet Nancy from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM (90 minutes) at Chinatown.\n- Travel from Chinatown to Bayview takes 22 minutes, arriving at 11:22 AM.\n- Meet Jessica from 11:22 AM to 12:07 PM (45 minutes) at Bayview.\n- Travel from Bayview to Alamo Square takes 16 minutes, arriving at 12:23 PM.\n- Meet Mary from 12:23 PM to 1:38 PM (75 minutes) at Alamo Square.\n\nThis schedule meets all constraints and maximizes the number of friends met (3 out of 4).\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:30AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:00AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:22AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:07PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:23PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:38PM\"}]}",
