    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints and the previous schedules, I realize the issue lies in the meeting with Jessica. Her availability starts at 11:15 AM, but in previous schedules, we arrived exactly at 11:22 AM, leaving no buffer. The optimal solution is to adjust the Nancy meeting to end earlier, ensuring we arrive at Jessica's location by 11:15 AM.\n\n**Revised Optimal Schedule:**\n1. **Meet Nancy in Chinatown** (90 mins):  \n   - Start: 9:30 AM (when her availability begins)  \n   - End: 11:00 AM  \n   - *Travel to Bayview (22 mins): Arrive at 11:22 AM \u2192 **Violates Jessica's 11:15 AM start***\n\n2. **Solution:** Shorten Nancy's meeting by 7 minutes to end at 10:53 AM:  \n   - Travel time: 22 mins \u2192 Arrive at Bayview at 11:15 AM (exactly when Jessica's availability starts)  \n   - Meet Jessica from 11:15 AM to 12:00 PM (45 mins minimum met).  \n\n3. **Then meet Mary in Alamo Square** (75 mins):  \n   - Travel from Bayview to Alamo Square (16 mins): Arrive 12:16 PM  \n   - Meet 12:16 PM to 1:31 PM (within her all-day availability).\n\n**Final Schedule:**  \n- Nancy: 9:30 AM \u2013 10:53 AM (83 mins \u2192 still exceeds her 60-min minimum)  \n- Jessica: 11:15 AM \u2013 12:00 PM (45 mins, exact minimum)  \n- Mary: 12:16 PM \u2013 1:31 PM (75 mins, exact minimum)  \n\nThis ensures:  \n\u2705 All meetings start/end within availability windows  \n\u2705 All minimum durations met  \n\u2705 Travel times fully accounted for  \n\u2705 Maximizes 3 meetings (Rebecca remains impossible)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:30 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:53 AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:00 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:16 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:31 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
