Rebecca cannot be met because her availability (7:00 AM to 8:30 AM) ends before your arrival at 9:00 AM. The optimal schedule maximizes the number of friends met while respecting all constraints and travel times:\n\n- Start at Financial District at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Chinatown (5 minutes), arriving at 9:05 AM. Wait until Nancy's availability starts at 9:30 AM.\n- Meet Nancy at Chinatown from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM (90 minutes), within her window (9:30 AM to 1:30 PM).\n- Travel to Bayview (22 minutes from Chinatown), arriving at 11:22 AM.\n- Meet Jessica at Bayview from 11:22 AM to 12:07 PM (45 minutes), within her window (11:15 AM to 1:45 PM; start is after 11:15 AM but within availability, and duration is met).\n- Travel to Alamo Square (16 minutes from Bayview), arriving at 12:23 PM.\n- Meet Mary at Alamo Square from 12:23 PM to 1:38 PM (75 minutes), within her window (7:00 AM to 9:00 PM).\n\nThis schedule meets all minimum duration requirements and availability constraints, with travel times fully accounted for. No constraints are violated.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:30AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:00AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:22AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:07PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:23PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:38PM\"}]}",
