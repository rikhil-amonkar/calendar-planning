Meet Mary first at Alamo Square since it's the next feasible location after arrival. Travel time from Financial District is 17 minutes (arrive 9:17 AM), meeting for 75 minutes until 10:32 AM.\n\n2. Travel to Chinatown (16 minutes) to meet Nancy, arriving at 10:48 AM. Meet for 90 minutes until 12:18 PM.\n\n3. Travel to Bayview (22 minutes) to meet Jessica, arriving at 12:40 PM. Meet for 45 minutes until 1:25 PM, within her availability.\n\nThis schedule satisfies all minimum meeting durations and availability constraints while maximizing the number of friends met.\n\n{\"meetings\": [\n{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:17AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:32AM\"},\n{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:48AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:18PM\"},\n{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:40PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:25PM\"}\n]}",
