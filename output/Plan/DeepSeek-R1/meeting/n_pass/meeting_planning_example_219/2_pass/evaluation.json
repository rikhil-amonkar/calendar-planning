    "execution_output": "After reevaluating the constraints and travel times, it remains impossible to meet all three friends while satisfying the minimum meeting durations due to the conflict between Barbara's and William's overlapping availability windows. Meeting both Barbara and William would require:\n- At least 60 minutes with Barbara between 4:45 PM and 6:15 PM\n- At least 105 minutes with William between 5:15 PM and 7:00 PM\n- 7 minutes of travel time between Union Square (Barbara) and Chinatown (William)\n\nHowever:\n- If we prioritize Barbara first (e.g., 4:45 PM\u20135:45 PM), we arrive at Chinatown at 5:52 PM, leaving only 68 minutes with William (5:52 PM\u20137:00 PM) < 105 minutes.\n- If we prioritize William first (e.g., 5:15 PM\u20137:00 PM), Barbara's window ends at 6:15 PM before we can reach her.\n\nThus, the optimal schedule meets **two friends** (Emily and William) to maximize the number of friends visited while honoring all constraints:\n1. **Emily (Alamo Square):** Met for 210 minutes (exceeds 105-minute minimum) from 11:45 AM to 3:15 PM.  \n   - Depart The Castro at 11:37 AM (8-minute travel).  \n2. **William (Chinatown):** Met for 105 minutes from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM.  \n   - Depart Alamo Square at 3:15 PM (16-minute travel, arrive Chinatown at 3:31 PM; wait until 5:15 PM).  \n\nBarbara cannot be included without violating William\u2019s minimum duration. This schedule adheres to all travel times and availability constraints.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"15:15\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:00\"}]}",
