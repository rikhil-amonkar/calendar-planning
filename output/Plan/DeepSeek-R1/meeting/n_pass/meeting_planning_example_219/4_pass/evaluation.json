    "execution_output": "After careful re-evaluation of the constraints and travel times, I confirm that meeting all three friends while satisfying minimum meeting durations is impossible due to the fundamental conflict between Barbara's and William's overlapping availability windows combined with travel time requirements. \n\nThe optimal solution meets **Emily and William**, which:\n- Maximizes the number of friends met (2 friends)\n- Satisfies all minimum meeting times\n- Achieves the highest total meeting time (315 minutes) compared to alternatives\n\n### Detailed Schedule\n1. **Emily at Alamo Square (11:45-15:15)**  \n   - Minimum required: 105 minutes | Actual: 210 minutes  \n   - Travel: Depart The Castro at 11:37 (8 min travel), arrive at 11:45  \n   - Meeting: 11:45 to 15:15 (exceeds minimum)\n\n2. **William at Chinatown (17:15-19:00)**  \n   - Minimum required: 105 minutes | Actual: 105 minutes  \n   - Travel: Depart Alamo Square at 15:15 (16 min travel), arrive at Chinatown at 15:31  \n   - Wait: 15:31 to 17:15 (acceptable idle time)  \n   - Meeting: 17:15 to 19:00 (exactly meets minimum)\n\n### Why Barbara cannot be included\n- Barbara's window (16:45-18:15 at Union Square) requires \u226560 minutes.  \n- To meet William for 105 minutes (17:15-19:00), we must be at Chinatown by 17:15.  \n- Travel from Union Square to Chinatown takes 7 minutes.  \n- **Conflict**:  \n  - If we meet Barbara first (e.g., 16:45-17:38), we arrive at Chinatown at 17:45 \u2192 William gets only 75 minutes (<105).  \n  - If we meet William first, we finish at 19:00 \u2192 Barbara's window ends at 18:15 (too late).  \n\n### Comparison to alternatives\n| Option             | Total Meeting Time | Notes |\n|--------------------|--------------------|-------|\n| **Emily + William** | 315 min (210+105) | **Optimal**: Highest meeting time |\n| Emily + Barbara   | 300 min (210+90)  | Lower meeting time (90<105) |\n| Barbara + William | \u2264173 min          | Fails William's minimum (max 68 min) |\n\n### JSON Output\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"15:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:00\"}\n  ]\n}",
