Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nThe Castro to Alamo Square: 8.\nThe Castro to Union Square: 19.\nThe Castro to Chinatown: 20.\nAlamo Square to The Castro: 8.\nAlamo Square to Union Square: 14.\nAlamo Square to Chinatown: 16.\nUnion Square to The Castro: 19.\nUnion Square to Alamo Square: 15.\nUnion Square to Chinatown: 7.\nChinatown to The Castro: 22.\nChinatown to Alamo Square: 17.\nChinatown to Union Square: 7.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at The Castro at 9:00AM. Emily will be at Alamo Square from 11:45AM to 3:15PM. You'd like to meet Emily for a minimum of 105 minutes. Barbara will be at Union Square from 4:45PM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 60 minutes. William will be at Chinatown from 5:15PM to 7:00PM. You'd like to meet William for a minimum of 105 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nPlease output the meeting schedule in the following JSON format:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"<DAY>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}]}"

        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nIt is not possible to meet all three friends for the minimum desired times due to the overlap between Barbara's and William's availability windows, combined with travel times. Specifically, Barbara is available from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM (a 90-minute window) with a minimum desired meeting time of 60 minutes, and William is available from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (a 105-minute window) with a minimum desired meeting time of 105 minutes. To meet William for the full 105 minutes, you must be at Chinatown from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM. Travel from Union Square (where Barbara is) to Chinatown takes 7 minutes, so to arrive at Chinatown by 5:15 PM, you must leave Union Square by 5:08 PM. However, Barbara starts at 4:45 PM, so the latest you can leave her to meet William on time is 5:08 PM, allowing only a 23-minute meeting with Barbara (from 4:45 PM to 5:08 PM), which is less than the 60-minute minimum. Meeting Barbara after William is impossible, as she leaves at 6:15 PM, and you are with William until 7:00 PM. Therefore, only one of Barbara or William can be met for their minimum time, but not both.\n\nThe optimal schedule is to meet Emily and William, as this allows you to satisfy both minimum meeting times:\n- Meet Emily at Alamo Square for the full available window (11:45 AM to 3:15 PM, 210 minutes, exceeding the 105-minute minimum).\n- Meet William at Chinatown for the full window (5:15 PM to 7:00 PM, 105 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n\nMeeting Barbara instead of William would also allow you to meet two friends (Emily and Barbara), but William's minimum time is higher (105 minutes vs. Barbara's 60 minutes), and meeting William fully utilizes his tight window. Thus, meeting Emily and William is chosen to optimize for the constraints.\n\nSchedule details:\n- Start at The Castro at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Alamo Square (8 minutes) departing at 11:37 AM to arrive at 11:45 AM for Emily.\n- Meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 3:15 PM.\n- Travel to Chinatown (16 minutes) departing at 3:15 PM to arrive at 3:31 PM; wait until 5:15 PM.\n- Meet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nBarbara is not met, as it is impossible to satisfy her minimum 60-minute meeting while also meeting William for 105 minutes.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"15:15\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:00\"}]}"
