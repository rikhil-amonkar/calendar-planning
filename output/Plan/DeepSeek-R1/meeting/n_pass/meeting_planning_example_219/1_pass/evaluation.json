    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: After considering various schedules, it is only possible to meet two friends with the minimum meeting times due to the time conflict between Barbara and William. Specifically, William must be met from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM to satisfy the 105-minute minimum, and Barbara must be met for at least 60 minutes between 4:45 PM and 6:15 PM. However, the travel time between Union Square (Barbara) and Chinatown (William) is 7 minutes, making it impossible to meet both without violating one of the minimum time constraints. For example:\n- Meeting Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM (60 minutes) and then traveling to Chinatown would arrive at 5:52 PM, leaving only 68 minutes with William (less than 105 minutes).\n- Meeting William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM overlaps with Barbara's availability, but you cannot be in two places at once.\n\nTherefore, the best schedule is to meet Emily and William, as this allows both minimum times to be satisfied:\n- Emily is met from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM (105 minutes) at Alamo Square.\n- William is met from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 minutes) at Chinatown.\n\nThis schedule includes:\n- Travel from The Castro to Alamo Square: Depart at 11:37 AM (8-minute travel) to arrive at 11:45 AM.\n- After meeting Emily, free time from 1:30 PM to 4:59 PM (at Alamo Square or en route).\n- Travel from Alamo Square to Chinatown: Depart at 4:59 PM (16-minute travel) to arrive at 5:15 PM.\n\nBarbara cannot be met without compromising William's minimum time, so she is excluded to meet two friends.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Emily\", \"start_time\": \"11:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:30PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"William\", \"start_time\": \"5:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:00PM\"}]}",
