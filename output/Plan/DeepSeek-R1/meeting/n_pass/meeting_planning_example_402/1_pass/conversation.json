The schedule starts at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM and proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Matthew at Marina District**: After traveling from Golden Gate Park (16 minutes), arrive at 9:16 AM. Meet from 9:16 AM to 9:31 AM (15 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n2. **Robert at Union Square**: After traveling from Marina District (16 minutes), arrive at 9:47 AM. Robert is available from 10:15 AM, so wait until then. Meet from 10:15 AM to 10:30 AM (15 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n3. **Joseph at Financial District**: After traveling from Union Square (9 minutes), leave at 2:06 PM to arrive at 2:15 PM. Meet from 2:15 PM to 2:45 PM (30 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n4. **Sarah at Haight-Ashbury**: After traveling from Financial District (19 minutes), leave at 4:41 PM to arrive at 5:00 PM.

The only idle time is from 10:30 AM to 2:06 PM at Union Square (after meeting Robert), but this is unavoidable due to Joseph's later availability. All constraints are satisfied.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:16 AM\", \"end_time\": \"9:31 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:15 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:30 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:45 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:45 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:45 PM\"}]}"
