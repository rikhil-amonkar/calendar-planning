Matthew is available from 9:15 AM, so you meet for 44 minutes (exceeding the 15-minute minimum).\n- **Meet Robert (10:16 AM to 4:34 PM at Union Square)**: Travel from Marina District to Union Square takes 16 minutes (leave 10:00 AM, arrive 10:16 AM). Robert is available all day, so you meet until it's time to leave for Sunset District, totaling over 6 hours (exceeding the 15-minute minimum).\n- **Meet Patricia (5:00 PM to 5:45 PM at Sunset District)**: Travel from Union Square to Sunset District takes 26 minutes (leave 4:34 PM, arrive 5:00 PM). You meet for exactly 45 minutes (meeting the minimum), ending at 5:45 PM.\n- **Meet Joseph (6:15 PM to 6:45 PM at Financial District)**: Travel from Sunset District to Financial District takes 30 minutes (leave 5:45 PM, arrive 6:15 PM). Joseph is available until 6:45 PM, so you meet for 30 minutes (meeting the minimum).\n- **Meet Sarah (7:04 PM to 8:49 PM at Haight-Ashbury)**: Travel from Financial District to Haight-Ashbury takes 19 minutes (leave 6:45 PM, arrive 7:04 PM). You meet for 105 minutes (meeting the minimum), ending at 8:49 PM, well within Sarah's availability until 9:30 PM.\n\n### Why this schedule optimizes meeting all friends:\n- **All friends are met** with their minimum time requirements satisfied.\n- **Travel times are minimized** by grouping meetings geographically where possible (e.g., Union Square is central for the afternoon, and Financial District is close to both Sunset and Haight-Ashbury in the evening).\n- **No idle time**: The long meeting with Robert fills the gap between morning and evening commitments, avoiding wasted time. The evening sequence (Patricia \u2192 Joseph \u2192 Sarah) ensures tight scheduling with no waiting, leveraging proximity and availability.\n- **Constraints honored**: All start times respect travel and availability windows (e.g., arriving at Sunset District exactly at 5:00 PM for Patricia, and meeting Sarah for the full 105 minutes within her window)."
