    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints again, I realize the previous solution violated Patricia's availability window. The schedule had Patricia's meeting starting at 5:00 PM and ending at 5:45 PM, but this doesn't account for the travel time to Sarah. More critically, the key violation was that Patricia's meeting should start no later than 7:45 PM, but the real issue is the sequencing. \n\nThe optimal solution meets friends in this order: Matthew (Marina), Robert (Union Square), Joseph (Financial District), Sarah (Haight-Ashbury), and Patricia (Sunset). This ensures:\n- All meetings respect minimum durations and availability windows\n- Travel times are fully accounted for between locations\n- Patricia's meeting ends exactly at her availability end time (7:45 PM)\n\nRevised schedule:\n1. **Matthew at Marina District**: Start at 9:16 AM (after 16 min travel from Golden Gate Park), meet 15 min until 9:31 AM\n2. **Robert at Union Square**: Start at 10:15 AM (after 16 min travel + wait), meet 15 min until 10:30 AM\n3. **Joseph at Financial District**: Start at 2:15 PM (after 9 min travel + wait), meet 30 min until 2:45 PM\n4. **Sarah at Haight-Ashbury**: Start at 5:00 PM (after 19 min travel + wait), meet 105 min until 6:45 PM\n5. **Patricia at Sunset District**: Start at 7:00 PM (after 15 min travel), meet 45 min until 7:45 PM\n\nThis schedule satisfies all constraints:\n- Matthew: 9:16-9:31 AM (within 9:15 AM-12:00 PM)\n- Robert: 10:15-10:30 AM (within 10:15 AM-4:00 PM)\n- Joseph: 2:15-2:45 PM (within 2:15 PM-4:00 PM)\n- Sarah: 5:00-6:45 PM (within 5:00 PM-9:30 PM)\n- Patricia: 7:00-7:45 PM (ends exactly at 7:45 PM cutoff)\n- All travel times (16 min, 9 min, 19 min, 15 min) are accounted for\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [\n  {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:16 AM\", \"end_time\": \"9:31 AM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:15 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:30 AM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:45 PM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:45 PM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:45 PM\"}\n]}",
