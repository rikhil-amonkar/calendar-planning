    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints and travel times, I identified that the previous schedule violated the requirement to meet Sarah for 105 minutes by scheduling her meeting too late in the evening, which created a chain reaction that compressed the meeting with Patricia against her end-time constraint. Here's the optimized schedule that meets all friends while respecting all constraints and minimum meeting times:\n\n1. **Matthew at Marina District**: Starts at 9:16 AM (immediately after 16-minute travel from Golden Gate Park), meeting for the minimum 15 minutes.\n2. **Robert at Union Square**: Starts at 10:15 AM (after 16-minute travel and waiting period), meeting for the minimum 15 minutes.\n3. **Joseph at Financial District**: Starts at 2:15 PM (after 9-minute travel from Union Square), meeting for the minimum 30 minutes.\n4. **Patricia at Sunset District**: Starts at 5:00 PM (after 31-minute travel and waiting period), meeting for 45 minutes.\n5. **Sarah at Haight-Ashbury**: Starts at 6:00 PM (after 15-minute travel), meeting for 105 minutes.\n\nThis schedule ensures:\n- Matthew is met within 9:15 AM\u201312:00 PM window\n- Robert is met after 10:15 AM start time\n- Joseph starts exactly at 2:15 PM\n- Patricia meets full 45 minutes before her 7:45 PM end time\n- Sarah gets full 105 minutes within her 5:00 PM\u20139:30 PM window\n- All travel times are accounted for between meetings\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [\n  {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:16 AM\", \"end_time\": \"9:31 AM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:15 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:30 AM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:45 PM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:45 PM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:45 PM\"}\n]}",
