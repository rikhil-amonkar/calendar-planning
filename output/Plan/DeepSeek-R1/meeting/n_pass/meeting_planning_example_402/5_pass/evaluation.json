    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints and travel times, I identified that the previous solution violated the travel time constraint between Union Square and Sunset District by using an indirect route (43 minutes) instead of the direct 31-minute route. Here's the optimized schedule that respects all travel times and constraints:\n\n1. **Matthew at Marina District**: Starts at 9:16 AM (after 16-minute travel from Golden Gate Park), meets for 15 minutes (ends 9:31 AM)\n2. **Robert at Union Square**: Starts at 10:15 AM (after 16-minute travel + waiting period), meets for 15 minutes (ends 10:30 AM)\n3. **Patricia at Sunset District**: Starts at 11:01 AM (after 31-minute direct travel from Union Square), meets for 45 minutes (ends 11:46 AM)\n4. **Joseph at Financial District**: Starts at 2:15 PM (after 34-minute travel via Haight-Ashbury + waiting period), meets for 30 minutes (ends 2:45 PM)\n5. **Sarah at Haight-Ashbury**: Starts at 5:00 PM (after 19-minute travel + waiting period), meets for 105 minutes (ends 6:45 PM)\n\nThis schedule ensures:\n- All minimum meeting times are satisfied\n- All availability windows are respected\n- Direct travel times are used where available (Union Square \u2192 Sunset = 31 mins)\n- Indirect travel uses shortest paths (Sunset \u2192 Financial District via Haight-Ashbury = 34 mins)\n- Patricia's meeting ends well before her 7:45 PM deadline\n- Sarah gets full 105 minutes within her 5:00-9:30 PM window\n- Joseph starts exactly at 2:15 PM as required\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:16 AM\", \"end_time\": \"9:31 AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:15 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:30 AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:01 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:46 AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:45 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:45 PM\"}\n  ]\n}",
