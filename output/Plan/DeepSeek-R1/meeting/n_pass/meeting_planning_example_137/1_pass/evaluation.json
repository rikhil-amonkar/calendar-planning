This minimizes waiting time and meets both friends with their minimum required meeting times.  \n\n- Arrive at Financial District at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel to Golden Gate Park (23 minutes), arriving at 9:23 AM.  \n- Meet Barbara from 9:23 AM to 11:37 AM (134 minutes, exceeding the 45-minute minimum).  \n- Travel to Chinatown (23 minutes), arriving at 12:00 PM.  \n- Meet Kenneth from 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM (90 minutes, meeting the minimum requirement within his 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM window).  \n\nThis schedule ensures no waiting time, as travel is timed to arrive just in time for meetings. Barbara is met for more than the minimum, and Kenneth is met for exactly 90 minutes starting at 12:00 PM.  \n\nOutput in the required JSON format:  \n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"9:23AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:37AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"12:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:30PM\"}]}",
