Since no other friends or activities are specified, you can spend the time from 9:00 AM until you need to travel to Chinatown at Golden Gate Park, but no meetings can be scheduled there due to lack of information.  \n- David is available at Chinatown from 4:00 PM to 9:45 PM, and you must meet him for at least 105 minutes.  \n- Travel from Golden Gate Park to Chinatown takes 23 minutes. To meet David starting at 4:00 PM, you leave Golden Gate Park at 3:37 PM to arrive on time.  \n- The meeting with David is scheduled from 4:00 PM (16:00) to 5:45 PM (17:45), which is exactly 105 minutes, meeting the minimum requirement. This frees up the rest of the evening for potential other activities, but no other friends are specified.  \n- With only David mentioned, this schedule meets one friend, which is the maximum possible given the constraints. The times are in 24-hour format as specified.",
