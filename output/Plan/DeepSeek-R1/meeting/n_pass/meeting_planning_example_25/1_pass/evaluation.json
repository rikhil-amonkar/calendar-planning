    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nTo meet as many friends as possible while satisfying the constraints, the optimal schedule involves spending time at Golden Gate Park to meet friends there before traveling to Chinatown to meet David for the minimum required 105 minutes. Since no other specific friends or locations are mentioned beyond Golden Gate Park and Chinatown, the maximum number of distinct friends that can be met is two: one group at Golden Gate Park and David at Chinatown. \n\n- Start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM to meet friends there. Stay until 3:37 PM to allow for travel time to Chinatown, arriving exactly at 4:00 PM when David becomes available. This avoids waiting time at Chinatown.\n- Meet David at Chinatown from 4:00 PM to 5:45 PM for exactly 105 minutes, satisfying the minimum duration requirement. Although David is available until 9:45 PM, meeting for the minimum frees up time, but since no other friends are specified, this duration is sufficient.\n\nThis schedule ensures two distinct meetings:\n1. At Golden Gate Park from 9:00 AM to 3:37 PM.\n2. With David at Chinatown from 4:00 PM to 5:45 PM.\n\nAttempting to return to Golden Gate Park after meeting David (e.g., arriving around 6:08 PM) would not increase the number of distinct friends met, as it would likely involve the same friends at Golden Gate Park. Thus, two meetings are optimal.\n\nThe meeting schedule in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Saturday\", \"start_time\": \"9:00AM\", \"end_time\": \"3:37PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Saturday\", \"start_time\": \"4:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:45PM\"}]}",
