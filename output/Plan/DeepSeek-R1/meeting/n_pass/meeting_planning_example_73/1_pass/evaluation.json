The earliest you can arrive at Pacific Heights is 9:07 AM. Barbara is available from 7:15 AM to 10:00 PM, so meeting from 9:07 AM to 10:07 AM satisfies the 60-minute minimum requirement. Since no other friends or constraints are provided, this schedule allows you to meet the only specified friend efficiently.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:07\", \"end_time\": \"10:07\"}]}",
