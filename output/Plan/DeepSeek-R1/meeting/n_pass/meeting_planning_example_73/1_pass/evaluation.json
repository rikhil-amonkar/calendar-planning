I start at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM and can leave immediately for Pacific Heights, arriving at 9:07 AM. Barbara is available from 7:15 AM to 10:00 PM, so meeting from 9:07 AM to 10:07 AM satisfies the 60-minute requirement and allows for flexibility later in the day.\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:07\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:07\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
