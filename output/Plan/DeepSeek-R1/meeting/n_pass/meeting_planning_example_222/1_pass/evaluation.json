Starting at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM, travel to North Beach first to meet Helen. Schedule the Helen meeting to end just in time to travel to Fisherman's Wharf for Kimberly, starting Kimberly's meeting late enough to avoid waiting for Patricia at Bayview. The sequence is Helen \u2192 Kimberly \u2192 Patricia.  \n\n- Helen at North Beach: Meeting from 2:44 PM to 4:44 PM (120 minutes, within availability 7:00 AM to 4:45 PM).  \n- Kimberly at Fisherman's Wharf: Meeting from 4:49 PM to 5:34 PM (45 minutes, within availability 4:30 PM to 9:00 PM).  \n- Patricia at Bayview: Meeting from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM (120 minutes, within availability 6:00 PM to 9:15 PM).  \n\nTravel details:  \n- Arrive North Beach at 9:08 AM (8 min from Nob Hill), but formal meeting starts at 2:44 PM to optimize schedule.  \n- Leave North Beach at 4:44 PM, arrive Fisherman's Wharf at 4:49 PM (5 min travel).  \n- Leave Fisherman's Wharf at 5:34 PM, arrive Bayview at 6:00 PM (26 min travel; no waiting as Patricia starts at 6:00 PM).  \n\nThis schedule avoids idle time except the period from 9:08 AM to 2:44 PM at North Beach, which is handled by being with Helen informally before the formal meeting starts.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:44 PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:44 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:49 PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:34 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:00 PM\"}]}",
