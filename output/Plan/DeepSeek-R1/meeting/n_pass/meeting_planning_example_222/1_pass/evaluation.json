    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo meet all three friends while adhering to the constraints and minimizing idle time, the optimal schedule involves meeting Helen last within her availability window to reduce waiting time before meeting Kimberly. Helen is met from 2:45 PM to 4:45 PM at North Beach for exactly 120 minutes. After traveling for 5 minutes to Fisherman's Wharf, Kimberly is met from 4:50 PM to 5:35 PM for 45 minutes. Then, after traveling 26 minutes to Bayview, Patricia is met from 6:01 PM to 8:01 PM for 120 minutes. This schedule ensures all meetings start and end within the friends' availability, with travel times accounted for and minimum meeting durations satisfied.
