    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nThe optimal schedule meets all five friends while respecting the minimum meeting times and availability constraints. The itinerary minimizes waiting time and travel time by grouping meetings geographically: starting with Elizabeth at Golden Gate Park (close to Presidio), then Brian at Financial District, followed by Jason at Richmond District (after his availability starts), Laura at Union Square, and finally Melissa at North Beach during her availability window. Travel times are accounted for between meetings, but only meeting actions are included in the JSON output.\n\nThe final meeting schedule is as follows:\n- Meet Elizabeth from 9:12 AM to 10:57 AM (105 minutes at Golden Gate Park).\n- Meet Brian from 11:23 AM to 11:38 AM (15 minutes at Financial District).\n- Meet Jason from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM (90 minutes at Richmond District).\n- Meet Laura from 2:51 PM to 4:06 PM (75 minutes at Union Square).\n- Meet Melissa from 6:45 PM to 7:30 PM (45 minutes at North Beach).\n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met with minimal waiting:\n- After starting at Presidio at 9:00 AM, travel to Golden Gate Park (12 minutes) allows meeting Elizabeth to start at 9:12 AM.\n- Travel from Golden Gate Park to Financial District (26 minutes) allows meeting Brian to start at 11:23 AM.\n- Travel from Financial District to Richmond District (21 minutes) results in arrival at 11:59 AM, with a short wait until Jason's availability at 1:00 PM.\n- Travel from Richmond District to Union Square (21 minutes) allows meeting Laura to start at 2:51 PM (within her availability from 2:15 PM).\n- Travel from Union Square to North Beach (10 minutes) is timed to arrive at 6:45 PM for Melissa's availability.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied, and all friends are met.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Elizabeth\", \"start_time\": \"09:12 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:57 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"11:23 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:38 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jason\", \"start_time\": \"01:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"02:30 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Laura\", \"start_time\": \"02:51 PM\", \"end_time\": \"04:06 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Melissa\", \"start_time\": \"06:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"07:30 PM\"}]}",
