    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo meet as many friends as possible while respecting the constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule involves meeting all five friends: Elizabeth, Brian, Jason, Laura, and Melissa. The schedule is designed to minimize waiting time and ensure that each meeting lasts at least the minimum required duration, with travel times accounted for between locations. The day is assumed to be the same as the arrival date (e.g., \"2023-10-07\" as a placeholder).\n\n### Schedule Summary:\n- **Elizabeth at Golden Gate Park:** Start after arrival and travel (9:12 AM), meet for minimum 105 minutes, ending at 11:57 AM.\n- **Jason at Richmond District:** Start at 1:00 PM (when available), meet for 90 minutes, ending at 2:30 PM.\n- **Brian at Financial District:** Start after travel from Richmond District (2:51 PM), meet for 15 minutes, ending at 3:06 PM.\n- **Laura at Union Square:** Start at 5:20 PM (to align with Melissa's window), meet for 75 minutes, ending at 6:35 PM.\n- **Melissa at North Beach:** Start at 6:45 PM (when available), meet for 45 minutes, ending at 7:30 PM.\n\n### Key Details:\n- **Start at Presidio:** 9:00 AM.\n- **Travel Times Used:**\n  - Presidio to Golden Gate Park: 12 minutes (arrive 9:12 AM).\n  - Golden Gate Park to Richmond District: 7 minutes (arrive 12:15 PM, but wait until 1:00 PM for Jason).\n  - Richmond District to Financial District: 21 minutes (arrive 2:51 PM).\n  - Financial District to Union Square: 9 minutes (arrive 3:15 PM, but wait until 5:20 PM for Laura).\n  - Union Square to North Beach: 10 minutes (arrive 6:45 PM for Melissa).\n- **Waiting Times:** \n  - 45 minutes at Richmond District (12:15 PM to 1:00 PM) before meeting Jason.\n  - Approximately 2 hours at Union Square (3:15 PM to 5:20 PM) before meeting Laura. This is minimized by scheduling Laura later to connect with Melissa.\n- **Feasibility:** All friends are met within their availability windows, with minimum durations satisfied. No conflicts with travel times.\n\n### JSON Output:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"2023-10-07\", \"start_time\": \"09:12\", \"end_time\": \"11:57\"}, {\"day\": \"2023-10-07\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:30\"}, {\"day\": \"2023-10-07\", \"start_time\": \"14:51\", \"end_time\": \"15:06\"}, {\"day\": \"2023-10-07\", \"start_time\": \"17:20\", \"end_time\": \"18:35\"}, {\"day\": \"2023-10-07\", \"start_time\": \"18:45\", \"end_time\": \"19:30\"}]}",
