    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nAfter evaluating various schedules, the optimal plan meets six friends: Elizabeth, Helen, Brian, Laura, Mary, and Deborah. This schedule maximizes the number of friends met while respecting all minimum meeting durations and travel times. The meetings are ordered to minimize travel conflicts and ensure timely arrivals. Sandra, Stephanie, and Karen cannot be included without violating minimum time constraints or causing scheduling conflicts.  \n\nThe meeting schedule in JSON format is as follows:  \n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:19\", \"end_time\": \"11:04\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:30\", \"end_time\": \"13:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"13:41\", \"end_time\": \"14:11\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:30\", \"end_time\": \"15:45\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"16:45\", \"end_time\": \"18:45\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:00\", \"end_time\": \"20:45\"}\n  ]\n}  \n\n### Explanation of the Schedule:\n- **Elizabeth at Marina District (9:19 AM to 11:04 AM)**: Start at Mission District at 9:00 AM, travel 19 minutes to arrive at 9:19 AM. Meet for 105 minutes, ending at 11:04 AM.\n- **Helen at Golden Gate Park (11:30 AM to 1:30 PM)**: Travel 18 minutes from Marina District, arriving at 11:22 AM. Wait until Helen's availability starts at 11:30 AM, then meet for 120 minutes, ending at 1:30 PM.\n- **Brian at Presidio (1:41 PM to 2:11 PM)**: Travel 11 minutes from Golden Gate Park, arriving at 1:41 PM. Meet for 30 minutes, ending at 2:11 PM.\n- **Laura at Alamo Square (2:30 PM to 3:45 PM)**: Travel 19 minutes from Presidio, arriving at 2:30 PM. Meet for 75 minutes, ending at 3:45 PM.\n- **Mary at Embarcadero (4:45 PM to 6:45 PM)**: Travel 16 minutes from Alamo Square, arriving at 4:01 PM. Wait until Mary's availability starts at 4:45 PM, then meet for 120 minutes, ending at 6:45 PM.\n- **Deborah at Financial District (7:00 PM to 8:45 PM)**: Travel 5 minutes from Embarcadero, arriving at 6:50 PM. Wait until Deborah's availability starts at 7:00 PM, then meet for 105 minutes, ending at 8:45 PM.\n\n### Why Other Friends Could Not Be Met:\n- **Sandra (Richmond District)**: Attempts to include Sandra (e.g., early morning) resulted in arriving late for Laura or other meetings, failing to meet Laura's 75-minute minimum.\n- **Stephanie (North Beach)**: No feasible slot between 10:15 AM and 4:00 PM that fits the 75-minute minimum without conflicting with Helen or Laura (e.g., arriving late for Laura by 2-3 minutes, insufficient for 75 minutes).\n- **Karen (Russian Hill)**: Conflicts with Mary and Deborah; meeting Karen requires 90 minutes ending by 6:49 PM to reach Deborah on time, but Karen's earliest end for 90 minutes is 7:30 PM, which is too late. After Mary, only 82 minutes are available before Karen's window closes, insufficient for 90 minutes. Skipping Mary or Deborah for Karen reduces the total number of meetings.",
