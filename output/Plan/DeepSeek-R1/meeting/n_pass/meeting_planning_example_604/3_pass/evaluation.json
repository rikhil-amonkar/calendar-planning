The schedule is optimized as follows:\n\n- **Joseph** at Alamo Square: 15-minute meeting within availability (11:30 AM-12:45 PM). Depart Fisherman's Wharf at 11:10 AM (20 min travel) to arrive at 11:30 AM.\n- **Karen** at Russian Hill: 30-minute meeting within availability (2:30 PM-7:45 PM). Depart Alamo Square at 11:45 AM (13 min travel) to arrive at 11:58 AM, then wait until 2:30 PM.\n- **Kimberly** at North Beach: 30-minute meeting within availability (3:45 PM-7:15 PM). Depart Russian Hill at 3:40 PM (5 min travel) to arrive at 3:45 PM.\n- **Laura** at The Castro: 105-minute meeting within availability (7:45 PM-9:30 PM). Depart North Beach at 7:23 PM (22 min travel) to arrive at 7:45 PM.\n\nWilliam and Stephanie cannot be met due to our 9:00 AM arrival at Fisherman's Wharf conflicting with their early availability. Daniel cannot be met as travel from Laura's meeting to Golden Gate Park would arrive at 9:41 PM, leaving only 4 minutes before his availability ends.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
