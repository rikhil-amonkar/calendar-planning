The schedule starts at Sunset District at 9:00 AM and sequences the meetings to minimize waiting time and ensure all meetings fit within the availability windows, with travel times accounted for. Matthew is met first in Richmond District due to proximity and early availability, with the meeting extended to reduce idle time later.

The final schedule includes all friends with meetings occurring within their specified time frames and meeting or exceeding the minimum duration requirements.\n\nOutput in the required JSON format:\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"09:12\", \"end_time\": \"10:24\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"10:45\", \"end_time\": \"11:15\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"11:33\", \"end_time\": \"12:48\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"12:59\", \"end_time\": \"15:23\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"15:45\", \"end_time\": \"16:45\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"16:56\", \"end_time\": \"18:26\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"20:45\", \"end_time\": \"21:45\"}]}"
