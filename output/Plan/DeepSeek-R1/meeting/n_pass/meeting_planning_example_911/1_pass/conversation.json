        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nTo maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints (minimum meeting durations, time windows, and travel times), the optimal schedule meets 8 friends: Nancy, Stephanie, Elizabeth, Robert, James, Sarah, Melissa, and Steven. This schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are satisfied and accounts for travel times between locations. Brian and David cannot be included without violating constraints for other friends.  \n\nThe meeting schedule in JSON format is as follows:  \n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:16\", \"end_time\": \"10:46\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:59\", \"end_time\": \"12:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:34\", \"end_time\": \"13:34\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"13:43\", \"end_time\": \"14:38\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:00\", \"end_time\": \"17:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:12\", \"end_time\": \"18:27\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:34\", \"end_time\": \"19:04\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:21\", \"end_time\": \"20:30\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n**Explanation of the schedule:**\n- **Nancy (Nob Hill):** Met from 09:16 to 10:46 (90 minutes, within 08:15\u201312:45 window).\n- **Stephanie (Haight-Ashbury):** Met from 10:59 to 12:15 (76 minutes, within 10:15\u201312:15 window).\n- **Elizabeth (Union Square):** Met from 12:34 to 13:34 (60 minutes, within 11:30\u201321:00 window).\n- **Robert (Financial District):** Met from 13:43 to 14:38 (55 minutes, within 13:15\u201315:15 window; min 45 minutes satisfied).\n- **James (Presidio):** Met from 15:00 to 17:00 (120 minutes, within 15:00\u201318:15 window).\n- **Sarah (Golden Gate Park):** Met from 17:12 to 18:27 (75 minutes, within 17:00\u201319:15 window).\n- **Melissa (Richmond District):** Met from 18:34 to 19:04 (30 minutes, within 14:00\u201319:30 window).\n- **Steven (North Beach):** Met from 19:21 to 20:30 (69 minutes, within 17:30\u201320:30 window; min 15 minutes satisfied).\n\n**Key details:**\n- **Start:** Arrive at The Castro at 09:00. Travel to first meeting (Nob Hill) takes 16 minutes, arriving at 09:16.\n- **Travel times:** Fully accounted for between meetings (e.g., 13 minutes from Nob Hill to Haight-Ashbury, 19 minutes from Haight-Ashbury to Union Square, etc.).\n- **Unmet friends:** Brian (Embarcadero, 14:15\u201316:00) and David (Marina District, 11:15\u201313:15) could not be included without conflicting with other meetings (e.g., David conflicts with Nancy/Stephanie; Brian conflicts with Robert/James).\n- **Optimization:** This schedule achieves 8 meetings, the maximum possible given the constraints. Adjustments like leaving Sarah early (at 18:27 instead of 19:15) allow Melissa to be included while meeting all minimum durations."
