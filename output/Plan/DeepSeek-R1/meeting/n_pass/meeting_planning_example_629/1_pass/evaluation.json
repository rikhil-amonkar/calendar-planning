    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: I have created an optimized schedule that allows you to meet all seven friends while satisfying the minimum time requirements and accounting for travel times between locations. The schedule is designed to minimize waiting time and ensure that you arrive at each location within the friend's availability window. \n\nHere is the meeting schedule in the required JSON format:\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:15 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:45 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:06 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:36 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"01:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"03:00 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"03:16 PM\", \"end_time\": \"03:31 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"03:53 PM\", \"end_time\": \"04:53 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"07:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"08:45 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"10:15 PM\"}]}\n\n### Explanation of the Schedule:\n- **Margaret (Chinatown):** Start at 9:15 AM, end at 10:45 AM (90 minutes). You start at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM, travel to Chinatown (9 minutes), arriving at 9:09 AM, and wait until Margaret's availability at 9:15 AM.\n- **Matthew (Presidio):** Start at 11:06 AM, end at 12:36 PM (90 minutes). Travel from Chinatown to Presidio takes 21 minutes; leave at 10:45 AM, arrive at 11:06 AM.\n- **Kimberly (Golden Gate Park):** Start at 1:00 PM, end at 3:00 PM (120 minutes). Travel from Presidio to Golden Gate Park takes 12 minutes; leave at 12:36 PM, arrive at 12:48 PM, and wait until Kimberly's availability at 1:00 PM.\n- **Nancy (Pacific Heights):** Start at 3:16 PM, end at 3:31 PM (15 minutes). Travel from Golden Gate Park to Pacific Heights takes 16 minutes; leave at 3:00 PM, arrive at 3:16 PM.\n- **Kenneth (Bayview):** Start at 3:53 PM, end at 4:53 PM (60 minutes). Travel from Pacific Heights to Bayview takes 22 minutes; leave at 3:31 PM, arrive at 3:53 PM.\n- **Helen (Richmond District):** Start at 7:45 PM, end at 8:45 PM (60 minutes). Travel from Bayview to Richmond District takes 25 minutes; leave at 7:20 PM (after free time), arrive at 7:45 PM.\n- **Rebecca (Fisherman's Wharf):** Start at 9:15 PM, end at 10:15 PM (60 minutes). Travel from Richmond District to Fisherman's Wharf takes 18 minutes; leave at 8:45 PM, arrive at 9:03 PM, and wait until Rebecca's availability at 9:15 PM.\n\n### Key Details:\n- **Total Friends Met:** All 7 friends are met, satisfying all minimum time requirements.\n- **Travel and Waiting Time:** Travel times are accounted for between meetings, with minor waiting periods (e.g., 12 minutes before Kimberly, 12 minutes before Rebecca). Free time occurs from approximately 4:53 PM to 7:20 PM, which can be used for rest or meals.\n- **Efficiency:** The schedule starts with the earliest available friend (Margaret) and sequences meetings geographically to minimize backtracking. For example, Chinatown to Presidio to Golden Gate Park flows well, and later meetings (Helen to Rebecca) are grouped to reduce travel.\n- **Constraints Adherence:** All friends are met within their availability windows, and minimum times are met (e.g., Nancy's short 15-minute meeting is scheduled efficiently between longer meetings).\n\nThis schedule optimizes your goal of meeting as many friends as possible in one day.",
