        "content": "SOLUTION:\nTo maximize the number of friends met while respecting the minimum meeting times and travel constraints, the optimal schedule meets 9 out of 10 friends. Sarah (Richmond District) is excluded because meeting her minimum 105 minutes would conflict with meeting Andrew, Melissa, or Daniel within their time windows. The schedule starts at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM and efficiently sequences meetings to minimize travel time and waiting, ensuring all other friends are met for at least their minimum duration.\n\nThe itinerary in JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joshua\", \"start_time\": \"09:21\", \"end_time\": \"09:36\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"09:51\", \"end_time\": \"10:36\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Betty\", \"start_time\": \"10:47\", \"end_time\": \"11:47\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Lisa\", \"start_time\": \"12:04\", \"end_time\": \"12:19\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"John\", \"start_time\": \"13:15\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Stephanie\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:00\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Melissa\", \"start_time\": \"17:00\", \"end_time\": \"19:00\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Daniel\", \"start_time\": \"19:07\", \"end_time\": \"20:07\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Andrew\", \"start_time\": \"20:15\", \"end_time\": \"22:00\"}]}"
