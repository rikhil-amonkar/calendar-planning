Starting at North Beach at 9:00 AM, I stay there until departing for Embarcadero to meet Mark. To minimize idle time, I meet Mark later in his availability window (from 3:45 PM to 5:45 PM), which satisfies the 120-minute minimum. After meeting Mark, I travel directly to Pacific Heights, departing Embarcadero at 6:34 PM to arrive exactly at 6:45 PM for Karen's meeting. I meet Karen for the full 90 minutes from 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM, as her availability window exactly matches the required minimum time. This schedule ensures I meet both friends with minimal idle time between activities.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"today\", \"start_time\": \"03:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"05:45 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"today\", \"start_time\": \"06:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"08:15 PM\"}]}",
