    "execution_output": "After re-evaluating the constraints, I identified a critical issue with the travel time from Mission District to Pacific Heights. The schedule must account for the full 16-minute travel time while ensuring arrival at Pacific Heights by 8:00 PM for James. The previous schedule ended Carol's meeting at 7:44 PM, leaving exactly 16 minutes for travel, but this risked being late if any delays occurred. To address this, I shortened Carol's meeting to the minimum required 15 minutes, allowing departure at 6:30 PM. This provides a 1.5-hour buffer before James' meeting, ensuring robust scheduling while meeting all minimum time requirements.\n\nRevised schedule:\n1. Start at North Beach (9:00 AM)\n2. Meet Sandra at Nob Hill (9:07-9:22 AM, 15 min)\n3. Meet Jeffrey at Union Square (9:30-11:30 AM, 120 min)\n4. Meet Mark at Golden Gate Park (11:52 AM-12:07 PM, 15 min)\n5. Meet Robert at Chinatown (12:30-2:00 PM, 90 min)\n6. Meet Carol at Mission District (6:15-6:30 PM, 15 min)\n7. Meet James at Pacific Heights (8:00-10:00 PM, 120 min)\n\nTravel validation:\n- Mission District \u2192 Pacific Heights: Depart 6:30 PM + 16 min = Arrive 6:46 PM (1h14m buffer before James)\n- All other travel times are within constraints\n- All minimum meeting times satisfied\n- All availability windows respected\n\nSOLUTION:\nThis schedule meets all 6 friends while ensuring robust travel buffers, particularly for the critical transition to James. The long gap between 2:00 PM and 6:15 PM is unavoidable given friend availabilities but is utilized for flexible travel to Carol.\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:07\", \"end_time\": \"09:22\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:30\", \"end_time\": \"11:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:52\", \"end_time\": \"12:07\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:30\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:15\", \"end_time\": \"18:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"22:00\"}\n  ]\n}",
