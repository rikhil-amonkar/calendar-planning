Starting at North Beach at 9:00 AM, the schedule is designed to minimize travel time and waiting, ensuring all meetings fit within the available windows. The meetings are as follows:\n\n- Meet Sandra at Nob Hill from 9:07 AM to 9:22 AM (15 minutes, within her availability 8:00 AM to 3:30 PM).\n- Meet Jeffrey at Union Square from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM (120 minutes, within his availability 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM).\n- Meet Mark at Golden Gate Park from 11:52 AM to 12:07 PM (15 minutes, within his availability 11:30 AM to 5:45 PM).\n- Meet Robert at Chinatown from 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM (90 minutes, within his availability 12:15 PM to 4:45 PM).\n- Meet Carol at Mission District from 6:15 PM to 7:44 PM (89 minutes, more than the minimum 15 minutes, within her availability 6:15 PM to 9:15 PM; departure at 7:44 PM allows travel to Pacific Heights by 8:00 PM).\n- Meet James at Pacific Heights from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM (120 minutes, exactly his availability window).\n\nTravel times are accounted for between meetings, and there is free time from 2:00 PM to 5:57 PM, which is used for transit or personal time before meeting Carol. All minimum meeting times are satisfied, and no friends are missed.\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:07\", \"end_time\": \"09:22\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:30\", \"end_time\": \"11:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:52\", \"end_time\": \"12:07\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:30\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:44\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"22:00\"}\n  ]\n}",
