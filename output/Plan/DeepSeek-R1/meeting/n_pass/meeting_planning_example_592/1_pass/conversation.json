        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nTo maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule involves meeting all six friends. The itinerary starts at North Beach at 9:00 AM and sequences meetings to minimize conflicts and idle time, accounting for travel between locations. Key decisions include:  \n- Meeting Sandra early at Nob Hill due to proximity and availability.  \n- Meeting Jeffrey immediately after at Union Square, starting as availability opens.  \n- Visiting Mark at Golden Gate Park next, arriving shortly after his availability begins.  \n- Meeting Robert at Chinatown after, with arrival timed to start shortly after his availability.  \n- Meeting Carol at Mission District early in her window to allow travel to James.  \n- Meeting James for the full 120 minutes at Pacific Heights from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM, requiring arrival by 8:00 PM.  \n\nTravel times are factored into the schedule (e.g., from Chinatown to Mission District takes 18 minutes). Idle time occurs between meetings (e.g., after Robert until Carol), but this is unavoidable given constraints. All minimum meeting times are satisfied.  \n\nThe itinerary in JSON format:  \n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:07\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:22\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:52\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:07\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"James\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
