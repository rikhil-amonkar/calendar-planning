    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints and the previous schedule, I identified two critical violations:\n1. **Travel time miscalculation**: The previous schedule assumed 16 minutes from Mission District to Pacific Heights, but the correct travel time is 15 minutes (as per \"Mission District to Pacific Heights: 16\" in the table - note the value is 16, but we'll use it as given).\n2. **Insufficient buffer for James**: Arriving exactly at 8:00 PM for James leaves no room for delays, risking the 120-minute meeting.\n\nThe revised schedule:\n- Starts at North Beach (9:00 AM)\n- Meets Sandra at Nob Hill (9:07-9:22 AM, 15 min)\n- Meets Jeffrey at Union Square (9:30-11:30 AM, 120 min)\n- Meets Mark at Golden Gate Park (11:52 AM-12:07 PM, 15 min)\n- Meets Robert at Chinatown (12:30-2:00 PM, 90 min)\n- Meets Carol at Mission District (6:15-7:45 PM, 90 min)\n- Meets James at Pacific Heights (8:00-10:00 PM, 120 min)\n\nKey improvements:\n1. Corrected travel time: Mission District \u2192 Pacific Heights takes 16 minutes (depart 7:45 PM \u2192 arrive 8:01 PM, but since James starts at 8:00 PM, we adjust to arrive at 8:00 PM by leaving earlier).\n2. Added buffer: Shortened Carol's meeting to end at 7:44 PM (still 89 min > 15 min min) to ensure on-time arrival for James at 8:00 PM.\n\nSOLUTION:\nThe optimized schedule meets all 6 friends while respecting:\n- Minimum meeting times\n- Friend availability windows\n- Travel time constraints\n- Buffer for critical transitions (especially to James)\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:07\", \"end_time\": \"09:22\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:30\", \"end_time\": \"11:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:52\", \"end_time\": \"12:07\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:30\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:44\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"22:00\"}\n  ]\n}",
