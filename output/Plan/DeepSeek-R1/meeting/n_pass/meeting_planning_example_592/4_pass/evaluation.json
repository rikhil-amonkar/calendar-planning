    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints, I identified that the previous schedule violated no explicit constraints but could be optimized for robustness. The key improvement is adjusting Carol's meeting to end earlier, providing a buffer for travel to James. The revised schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met, availability windows are respected, and travel times are accounted for with safety margins.\n\n**Revised Schedule:**\n1. **Sandra at Nob Hill (9:07-9:22 AM):**  \n   - 15-minute meeting (\u226515 min required)  \n   - Within availability (8:00 AM-3:30 PM)  \n   - Travel: North Beach \u2192 Nob Hill (7 min, arrives at 9:07)\n\n2. **Jeffrey at Union Square (9:30-11:30 AM):**  \n   - 120-minute meeting (\u226530 min required)  \n   - Starts exactly at Jeffrey's availability (9:30 AM-3:30 PM)  \n   - Travel: Nob Hill \u2192 Union Square (8 min, arrives at 9:30)\n\n3. **Mark at Golden Gate Park (11:52 AM-12:07 PM):**  \n   - 15-minute meeting (\u226515 min required)  \n   - Within availability (11:30 AM-5:45 PM)  \n   - Travel: Union Square \u2192 Golden Gate Park (22 min, arrives at 11:52)\n\n4. **Robert at Chinatown (12:30-2:00 PM):**  \n   - 90-minute meeting (\u226560 min required)  \n   - Within availability (12:15 PM-4:45 PM)  \n   - Travel: Golden Gate Park \u2192 Chinatown (23 min, arrives at 12:30)\n\n5. **Carol at Mission District (6:15-7:30 PM):**  \n   - 75-minute meeting (\u226515 min required)  \n   - Within availability (6:15 PM-9:15 PM)  \n   - Travel: Chinatown \u2192 Mission District (16 min, departs by 5:59 PM to arrive at 6:15 PM)\n\n6. **James at Pacific Heights (8:00-10:00 PM):**  \n   - 120-minute meeting (\u226560 min required)  \n   - Exactly matches availability (8:00-10:00 PM)  \n   - Travel: Mission District \u2192 Pacific Heights (16 min, departs 7:30 PM, arrives 7:46 PM with 14-min buffer)\n\n**Key Improvements:**\n- **Carol's meeting ends at 7:30 PM** (instead of 7:44 PM), providing a 14-minute buffer before James' meeting.\n- All travel times are fully respected, with explicit buffers for critical transitions (e.g., Carol \u2192 James).\n- The gap from 2:00 PM to 6:15 PM is used for flexible transit to Carol, as no other meetings are possible.\n\n**Constraint Validation:**\n- **Travel times:** All transitions fit within gaps (e.g., 22 min between Jeffrey and Mark uses the full 22-min window).\n- **Meeting minimums:** All friends receive \u2265 their required time (Carol: 75 > 15 min).\n- **Availability:** All meetings occur within stated windows (e.g., Robert starts after 12:15 PM).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:07\", \"end_time\": \"09:22\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:30\", \"end_time\": \"11:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:52\", \"end_time\": \"12:07\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:30\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"22:00\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
