Since no other friends or their availabilities are provided, the schedule focuses solely on meeting Kenneth for the required minimum of 90 minutes within his availability window (2:15 PM to 7:45 PM). \n\nTo optimize the schedule:\n- Start the meeting as early as possible (2:15 PM) to free up the rest of the day for potential meetings with other friends at Fisherman's Wharf, though none are specified.\n- Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes, so depart Fisherman's Wharf at 2:04 PM to arrive at Nob Hill by 2:15 PM.\n- The meeting lasts 90 minutes, ending at 3:45 PM.\n- After the meeting, depart Nob Hill at 3:45 PM and arrive back at Fisherman's Wharf at 3:56 PM, allowing time to meet friends there for the remainder of the day.\n\nThis schedule ensures the meeting with Kenneth is satisfied and maximizes potential time at Fisherman's Wharf for other activities or meetings, given the constraints.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"2:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:45PM\"}]}"
