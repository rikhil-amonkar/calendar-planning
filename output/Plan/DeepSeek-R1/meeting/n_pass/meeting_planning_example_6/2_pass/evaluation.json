Since no other friends are mentioned, the schedule focuses solely on meeting Kenneth for the required minimum of 90 minutes within his availability window (2:15 PM to 7:45 PM). \n\nTo maximize flexibility for potential meetings with other friends (though none are specified), the meeting with Kenneth is scheduled as early as possible. This allows the rest of the day (after 3:45 PM) to be free for other activities or unplanned meetings.\n\n**Schedule:**\n- Depart Fisherman's Wharf at **2:04 PM** (11-minute travel time).\n- Arrive at Nob Hill at **2:15 PM** (start of Kenneth's availability).\n- Meet Kenneth from **2:15 PM to 3:45 PM** (90 minutes).\n- Depart Nob Hill at 3:45 PM (return to Fisherman's Wharf by 3:56 PM if needed).\n\nThis satisfies all constraints:  \n- Kenneth is met for exactly 90 minutes within his availability window.  \n- Travel time is accounted for (arrive at Nob Hill by 2:15 PM).\n\n**Final meeting schedule in JSON format:**\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"2:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:45PM\"}]}",
