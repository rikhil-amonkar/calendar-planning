The optimal schedule meets Kenneth for exactly 90 minutes, starting as early as possible to maximize flexibility for other potential meetings (though no other friends are specified). \n\nTravel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. To arrive at Nob Hill by 2:15 PM, depart Fisherman's Wharf at 2:04 PM. The meeting runs from 2:15 PM to 3:45 PM (90 minutes). After the meeting, return travel is not required for scheduling purposes.\n\nThis satisfies all constraints:\n- Kenneth is met for 90 minutes within his availability.\n- Travel time is accounted for (departure at 2:04 PM ensures arrival by 2:15 PM).\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"2:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:45PM\"}]}",
