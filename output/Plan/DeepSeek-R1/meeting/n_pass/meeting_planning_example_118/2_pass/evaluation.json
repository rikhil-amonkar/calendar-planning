    "execution_output": "After reevaluating the constraints and schedules, it is impossible to meet both Richard and Charles for the minimum required 120 minutes each due to travel time and the limited window (9:00 AM to 1:00 PM). The total meeting time (240 minutes) plus minimum travel time (41-53 minutes) exceeds the available 240 minutes. \n\nMeeting one friend for 120 minutes is feasible. Between the two options:\n- Meeting Richard first allows a 120-minute meeting but leaves only 79 minutes for Charles (below minimum).\n- Meeting Charles first allows a 120-minute meeting but leaves only 53 minutes for Richard (below minimum).\n\nSince the minimum 120-minute requirement is a hard constraint (as indicated by the rejection of the previous solution for violating it), meeting for less than 120 minutes does not satisfy the constraint. Therefore, the optimal solution is to meet **one friend for the full 120 minutes**. \n\nWe choose **Richard** for this meeting, as it starts earlier (9:17 AM) and avoids waiting time. The schedule is:\n\nSOLUTION:  \nDue to the constraints requiring at least 120 minutes with each friend and insufficient time including travel, only one friend can be met for the full duration. Richard is met from 9:17 AM to 11:17 AM.\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:17 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:17 AM\"}]}",
