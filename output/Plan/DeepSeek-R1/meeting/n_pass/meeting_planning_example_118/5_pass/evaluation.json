    "execution_output": "After re-evaluating the time formatting requirements, I recognize the need to use two-digit hour formatting (HH:MM AM/PM) as specified in the constraints. The previous solution's times (9:45 AM, 11:45 AM) should have been formatted as 09:45 AM and 11:45 AM respectively. However, upon further analysis, meeting Richard remains the optimal choice due to lower non-meeting time.\n\n**Optimal Schedule (Richard):**\n- Depart Bayview: 09:00 AM\n- Travel time: 17 minutes\n- Arrive Union Square: 09:17 AM\n- Meeting: 09:17 AM to 11:17 AM (120 minutes)\n\n**Corrected JSON Solution:**\n```json\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"09:17 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:17 AM\"}]}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n1. \u2705 **Meeting duration**: 120 minutes (meets minimum requirement)\n2. \u2705 **Richard's availability**: 08:45 AM\u20131:00 PM (09:17 AM falls within window)\n3. \u2705 **Travel time**: 17 minutes (accounted for in schedule)\n4. \u2705 **Time format**: Uses HH:MM AM/PM (two-digit hours)\n5. \u2705 **Total window**: Fits within 09:00 AM\u20131:00 PM\n\nMeeting Charles would require 31 min travel + 14 min waiting (45 min non-meeting) compared to Richard's 17 min travel (no waiting). Richard's schedule minimizes non-meeting time while satisfying all constraints.",
