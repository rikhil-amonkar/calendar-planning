    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nAfter considering various schedules, the best option to meet as many friends as possible while optimizing for the minimum meeting time goals is to meet Richard first at Union Square for 79 minutes, then meet Charles at Presidio for the full 120 minutes. This schedule ensures Charles meets the 120-minute minimum, while Richard falls short by 41 minutes but is still met. The total meeting time is maximized under the constraints, and both friends are visited.  \n\nTravel is accounted for:  \n- Depart Bayview at 9:00 AM, arrive Union Square at 9:17 AM (17 minutes travel).  \n- Meet Richard from 9:17 AM to 10:36 AM (79 minutes).  \n- Depart Union Square at 10:36 AM, arrive Presidio at 11:00 AM (24 minutes travel).  \n- Meet Charles from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM (120 minutes, within his availability from 9:45 AM to 1:00 PM).  \n\nAlternative schedules (e.g., meeting Charles first) result in lower meeting times for one friend (e.g., 53 minutes for Charles) or both friends not meeting the minimum, making this the optimal choice.  \n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:17 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:36 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"11:00 AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:00 PM\"}]}",
