        "content": "After evaluating the constraints and travel times, it is impossible to meet both Richard and Charles for at least 120 minutes each due to the limited time window (9:00 AM to 1:00 PM) and the travel times involved. The total available time is 240 minutes, but the minimum meeting times (120 minutes each) plus the required travel times exceed this. Specifically:\n\n- If Richard is met first, the earliest start at Union Square is 9:17 AM (after 17 minutes travel from Bayview). Ending at 11:17 AM allows for a 120-minute meeting, but arriving at Presidio at 11:41 AM (after 24 minutes travel) leaves only 79 minutes until 1:00 PM for Charles, which is less than 120 minutes.\n- If Charles is met first, arriving at Presidio at 9:31 AM (after 31 minutes travel) allows a start at 9:45 AM. Ending at 11:45 AM for a 120-minute meeting means arriving at Union Square at 12:07 PM (after 22 minutes travel), leaving only 53 minutes until 1:00 PM for Richard, which is also less than 120 minutes.\n\nThus, only one friend can be met for the full 120 minutes. To maximize the number of friends met and optimize for the minimum time goal, the best schedule is to meet Richard for 120 minutes first, as this allows more time for the second meeting with Charles (79 minutes) compared to meeting Charles first (which leaves only 53 minutes for Richard). This schedule meets Richard for the desired minimum time and also meets Charles for as long as possible within the constraints.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Richard\", \"start_time\": \"09:17\", \"end_time\": \"11:17\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Charles\", \"start_time\": \"11:41\", \"end_time\": \"13:00\"}]}"
