    "execution_output": "After re-evaluating the constraints and goals, it is impossible to meet both friends for the required 120 minutes each within the available time window (9:00 AM to 1:00 PM) due to travel times. However, to maximize the number of friends met while adhering to the minimum meeting time constraint (where meetings must be at least 120 minutes to satisfy the \"minimum\" requirement), the optimal solution is to meet one friend for the full 120 minutes. \n\nBetween the two options:\n- Meeting Richard first: Arrive at Union Square at 9:17 AM, meet from 9:17 AM to 11:17 AM (120 minutes within his 8:45 AM\u20131:00 PM availability).\n- Meeting Charles first: Arrive at Presidio at 9:31 AM, wait until 9:45 AM, meet from 9:45 AM to 11:45 AM (120 minutes within his 9:45 AM\u20131:00 PM availability).\n\nBoth options satisfy the minimum 120-minute requirement for one friend. We select meeting **Richard** as it starts earlier and avoids waiting time.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:17 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:17 AM\"}]}",
