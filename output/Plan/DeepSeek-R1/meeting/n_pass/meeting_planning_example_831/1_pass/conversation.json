Laura is not included due to time constraints and conflicts with other meetings. The meetings for Elizabeth and Margaret are shorter than the desired minimum (60 minutes instead of 105 for Elizabeth, and 50 minutes instead of 90 for Margaret), but this was necessary to fit within the tight windows and travel times. Ronald, Jeffrey, Jason, Melissa, and George meet or exceed their minimum durations. Travel times are accounted for between meetings, starting from Presidio at 9:00 AM."
