    "execution_output": "After considering various schedules to maximize the number of friends met while respecting minimum meeting times, travel times, and availability constraints, the optimal schedule meets 6 friends: Richard, Jeffrey, Ronald, Elizabeth, Melissa, and George. The schedule ensures minimum meeting times are met for these friends, with travel times accounted for between locations. Laura, Jason, and Margaret could not be included without violating constraints or minimum times due to conflicts with travel and availability windows.\n\n- Start at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Chinatown (21 minutes) for Richard, arriving at 9:21 AM. Wait until 9:30 AM (Richard's start time), then meet from 9:30 AM to 9:45 AM (15 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (12 minutes) for Jeffrey, arriving at 9:57 AM. Wait until 10:15 AM (Jeffrey's start time), then meet from 10:15 AM to 11:45 AM (90 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Alamo Square (21 minutes) for Ronald, arriving at 12:06 PM. Meet from 12:06 PM to 2:06 PM (120 minutes, meeting the minimum and ending before Ronald's 2:45 PM departure).\n- Travel to Sunset District (16 minutes) for Elizabeth, arriving at 2:22 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM (Elizabeth's start time), then meet from 2:45 PM to 4:30 PM (105 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Union Square (30 minutes) for Melissa, arriving at 5:00 PM. Wait until 5:45 PM (Melissa's start time), then meet from 5:45 PM to 6:00 PM (15 minutes, meeting the minimum within her availability).\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park (22 minutes) for George, arriving at 6:22 PM. Wait until 7:00 PM (George's start time), then meet from 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM (75 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n\nLaura, Jason, and Margaret were not included because:\n- Laura requires 60 minutes, but her window (9:45 AM to 6:00 PM) conflicted with tighter schedules for other friends; meeting her would reduce the number of friends met.\n- Jason requires 105 minutes ending by 4:00 PM, but after meeting Ronald and Elizabeth, arrival times were too late for a full meeting.\n- Margaret requires 90 minutes starting after 1:15 PM, but fitting her around Elizabeth, Melissa, and George resulted in insufficient time or conflicts.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:30\", \"end_time\": \"09:45\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:45\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:06\", \"end_time\": \"14:06\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:45\", \"end_time\": \"16:30\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:45\", \"end_time\": \"18:00\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:00\", \"end_time\": \"20:15\"}]}",
