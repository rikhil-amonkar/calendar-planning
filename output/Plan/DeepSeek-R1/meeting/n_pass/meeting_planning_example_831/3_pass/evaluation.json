    "execution_output": "After reevaluating the constraints, I confirm that the revised schedule meets all minimum meeting times and availability windows while respecting travel times. The previous violation (Richard's meeting time) was successfully corrected. The current schedule meets 6 friends: Ronald, Richard, Jeffrey, Elizabeth, Melissa, and George. The only adjustment needed is for George's meeting to start immediately upon arrival at 6:22 PM rather than waiting unnecessarily until 7:00 PM, as his availability begins at 5:00 PM.\n\n### Final Validated Schedule:\n- **Start at Presidio at 9:00 AM**.\n- **Travel to Alamo Square (24 minutes)**:  \n  Arrive at 9:24 AM.  \n  Meet Ronald from 9:24 AM to 11:24 AM (120 minutes, meets 90-minute minimum, ends before 2:45 PM).\n- **Travel to Chinatown (15 minutes)**:  \n  Arrive at 11:39 AM.  \n  Meet Richard from 11:39 AM to 12:09 PM (30 minutes, meets 30-minute minimum).\n- **Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (12 minutes)**:  \n  Arrive at 12:21 PM.  \n  Meet Jeffrey from 12:21 PM to 1:51 PM (90 minutes, meets minimum, ends before 4:00 PM).\n- **Travel to Sunset District (16 minutes)**:  \n  Arrive at 2:07 PM.  \n  Wait until Elizabeth's availability starts at 2:45 PM.  \n  Meet Elizabeth from 2:45 PM to 4:30 PM (105 minutes, meets 90-minute minimum).\n- **Travel to Union Square (18 minutes)**:  \n  Arrive at 4:48 PM.  \n  Wait until Melissa's availability starts at 5:45 PM.  \n  Meet Melissa from 5:45 PM to 6:00 PM (15 minutes, meets minimum within her 5:45 PM\u20136:00 PM window).\n- **Travel to Golden Gate Park (22 minutes)**:  \n  Arrive at 6:22 PM.  \n  Meet George from 6:22 PM to 7:37 PM (75 minutes, exceeds 45-minute minimum, ends before 8:15 PM).\n\n### Why Constraints Are Satisfied:\n- **All minimum meeting times met**: Ronald (120 > 90), Richard (30 \u2265 30), Jeffrey (90 \u2265 90), Elizabeth (105 > 90), Melissa (15 \u2265 15), George (75 > 45).\n- **Availability respected**:  \n  - Richard: Meeting (11:39 AM\u201312:09 PM) within 9:30 AM\u20136:00 PM.  \n  - Jeffrey: Meeting (12:21\u20131:51 PM) within 10:15 AM\u20134:00 PM.  \n  - Elizabeth: Meeting (2:45\u20134:30 PM) within 2:45\u20137:00 PM.  \n  - Melissa: Meeting (5:45\u20136:00 PM) exactly within 5:45\u20136:00 PM.  \n  - George: Meeting (6:22\u20137:37 PM) within 5:00\u20138:15 PM.  \n- **Travel times fully accounted**: Sequential travel aligns with the provided matrix (no over/under-estimation).\n- **Start/end consistency**: Starts at Presidio (9:00 AM), ends at Golden Gate Park (7:37 PM).\n\n### Why Laura, Jason, Margaret Excluded:\n- **Laura** (Presidio):  \n  Meeting her (min 60 min) would delay departure to Ronald. Latest possible start is 9:45 AM, ending at 10:45 AM. This delays Ronald's arrival to 11:09 AM (24-min travel), causing his meeting to end at 1:09 PM and conflicting with Jeffrey/Elizabeth.\n- **Jason** (Sausalito):  \n  Requires 105 min ending by 4:00 PM. Earliest arrival: 9:35 AM (35-min travel from Presidio). Meeting until 11:20 AM makes Ronald's arrival 12:44 PM (24+15+35 min travel), ending at 2:44 PM\u2014conflicting with Elizabeth's 2:45 PM start.\n- **Margaret** (Mission District):  \n  Travel times to/from Mission District **not provided in the matrix**, making scheduling impossible. Even if added, her 90-min requirement starting after 1:15 PM conflicts with Jeffrey-Elizabeth transit.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:24\", \"end_time\": \"11:24\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:39\", \"end_time\": \"12:09\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:21\", \"end_time\": \"13:51\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:45\", \"end_time\": \"16:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:45\", \"end_time\": \"18:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:22\", \"end_time\": \"19:37\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
