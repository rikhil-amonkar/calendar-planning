Travel time from Russian Hill to Richmond District is 14 minutes. To meet Barbara, you must leave Russian Hill at 1:01 PM to arrive exactly at 1:15 PM. The meeting can then start promptly at 1:15 PM and last for the minimum required 45 minutes, ending at 2:00 PM. This schedule satisfies all constraints and maximizes the opportunity to meet other friends (though none are specified) by freeing up the remaining time (2:00 PM onward). \n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"1:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:00PM\"}]}",
