The solution ensures no constraints are violated:\n\n- You start at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Richmond District takes 14 minutes.\n- Barbara is available from 1:15 PM to 6:15 PM.\n- You must meet for at least 45 minutes.\n\nTo maximize potential time for other friends (though none are specified), the earliest possible meeting is scheduled:\n- Depart Russian Hill at 1:01 PM (14 minutes before Barbara's availability starts).\n- Arrive at Richmond District at 1:15 PM.\n- Meet from 1:15 PM to 2:00 PM (45 minutes).\n\nThis leaves the entire afternoon free (2:00 PM onward) for other activities or friends, optimizing the goal of meeting as many friends as possible given the constraints.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"1:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:00PM\"}]}",
