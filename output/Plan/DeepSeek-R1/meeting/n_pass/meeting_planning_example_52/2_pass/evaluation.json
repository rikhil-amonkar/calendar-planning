To minimize waiting time, travel from Russian Hill to Richmond District to arrive just as Barbara becomes available. Leave Russian Hill at 1:01 PM (14 minutes travel) to arrive at Richmond District at 1:15 PM. The meeting can then start at 1:15 PM and end at 2:00 PM, satisfying the 45-minute minimum. No other friends are mentioned, so this schedule meets the goal of maximizing friend meetings with the given constraints.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"1:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:00 PM\"}]}",
