        "content": "SOLUTION:\nTo maximize the number of friends met, the schedule prioritizes meetings based on availability, minimum meeting times, and travel times. After evaluating various schedules, the optimal plan meets 7 friends: Jeffrey, Charles, Robert, Kimberly, Karen, Joshua, and Brian. David is excluded because it is impossible to meet the 75-minute minimum within his availability window (2:45 PM to 4:30 PM) due to the fixed meeting with Charles ending at 3:00 PM and travel time to North Beach resulting in only 72 available minutes. William is excluded because it is impossible to meet the 120-minute minimum within his availability window (12:30 PM to 7:15 PM) without conflicting with other meetings, such as Kimberly's start time at 5:00 PM. Nancy is excluded due to her 105-minute minimum, which cannot be satisfied with the late start time available after other commitments.\n\nThe schedule accounts for travel times between districts and ensures all meetings start and end within the friends' availability windows while meeting the minimum time requirements. The day is considered as \"1\" for simplicity.\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"friend\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"district\": \"Richmond District\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"friend\": \"Charles\",\n      \"district\": \"Presidio\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:18\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:48\",\n      \"friend\": \"Robert\",\n      \"district\": \"Nob Hill\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:15\",\n      \"friend\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"district\": \"Marina District\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:29\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:29\",\n      \"friend\": \"Karen\",\n      \"district\": \"Embarcadero\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:48\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:48\",\n      \"friend\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"district\": \"Alamo Square\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:58\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:58\",\n      \"friend\": \"Brian\",\n      \"district\": \"Mission District\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
