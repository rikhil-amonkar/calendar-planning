    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: The optimal schedule meets 7 friends while satisfying all minimum meeting times and travel constraints. The itinerary is as follows, with all times in HH:MM format:\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"12:00\", \"end_time\": \"12:45\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Charles\", \"start_time\": \"13:15\", \"end_time\": \"15:00\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"15:18\", \"end_time\": \"16:48\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kimberly\", \"start_time\": \"17:00\", \"end_time\": \"18:15\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"18:29\", \"end_time\": \"19:29\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joshua\", \"start_time\": \"19:48\", \"end_time\": \"20:48\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"20:58\", \"end_time\": \"21:58\"}]}\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Jeffrey (Richmond District)**: Met from 12:00 PM to 12:45 PM (45 minutes, satisfying the 45-minute minimum). Travel from Sunset District (start at 9:00 AM) to Richmond District takes 12 minutes; departure at 11:48 AM ensures arrival by 12:00 PM.\n- **Charles (Presidio)**: Met from 1:15 PM to 3:00 PM (105 minutes, exactly the available window and minimum). Travel from Richmond to Presidio takes 7 minutes; departure at 12:45 PM ensures arrival by 12:52 PM, with a short wait until 1:15 PM.\n- **Robert (Nob Hill)**: Met from 3:18 PM to 4:48 PM (90 minutes, satisfying the 90-minute minimum). Travel from Presidio to Nob Hill takes 18 minutes; departure at 3:00 PM ensures arrival by 3:18 PM.\n- **Kimberly (Marina District)**: Met from 5:00 PM to 6:15 PM (75 minutes, satisfying the 75-minute minimum). Travel from Nob Hill to Marina District takes 11 minutes; departure at 4:48 PM ensures arrival by 4:59 PM, with a 1-minute wait until 5:00 PM.\n- **Karen (Embarcadero)**: Met from 6:29 PM to 7:29 PM (60 minutes, satisfying the 60-minute minimum). Travel from Marina District to Embarcadero takes 14 minutes; departure at 6:15 PM ensures arrival by 6:29 PM.\n- **Joshua (Alamo Square)**: Met from 7:48 PM to 8:48 PM (60 minutes, satisfying the 60-minute minimum). Travel from Embarcadero to Alamo Square takes 19 minutes; departure at 7:29 PM ensures arrival by 7:48 PM.\n- **Brian (Mission District)**: Met from 8:58 PM to 9:58 PM (60 minutes, satisfying the 60-minute minimum). Travel from Alamo Square to Mission District takes 10 minutes; departure at 8:48 PM ensures arrival by 8:58 PM.\n\n### Friends not met:\n- **David (North Beach)**: Not met due to a scheduling conflict with Charles. David's window (2:45 PM to 4:30 PM) requires a 75-minute meeting, but travel from Presidio (after Charles ends at 3:00 PM) arrives at North Beach at 3:18 PM, leaving only 72 minutes until 4:30 PM, which is insufficient.\n- **William (Russian Hill)**: Not met to prioritize Kimberly and Joshua. William requires a 120-minute block, but starting after Robert (earliest 4:53 PM) conflicts with Kimberly's 5:00 PM start, and later options reduce Kimberly's meeting time below 75 minutes.\n- **Nancy (Pacific Heights)**: Not met to maintain the compact schedule for other friends. Nancy requires 105 minutes, but fitting her would conflict with Robert or Kimberly due to travel and time constraints.\n\nThis schedule maximizes the number of meetings (7 out of 10) while adhering to all constraints and travel times.",
