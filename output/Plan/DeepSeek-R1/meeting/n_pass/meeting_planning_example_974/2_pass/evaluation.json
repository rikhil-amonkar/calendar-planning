    "has_execution_error": false,
    "execution_output": "After re-evaluating the schedule and travel times, the optimal solution meets 7 friends while respecting all constraints. The violations in the previous schedule were due to incorrect travel time calculations for transitions between Embarcadero, Alamo Square, and Mission District. The corrected schedule accurately accounts for travel times and ensures all meetings:\n- Occur within friends' availability windows\n- Meet minimum duration requirements\n- Allow sufficient travel time between districts\n\nThe revised schedule maximizes meetings by prioritizing friends with tighter time constraints first (Jeffrey, Charles, David) while maintaining feasible travel to later meetings (Robert, Kimberly, Karen, Joshua, Brian). William and Nancy cannot be included without violating other constraints.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:00\", \"end_time\": \"12:45\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"13:15\", \"end_time\": \"15:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:18\", \"end_time\": \"16:48\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:00\", \"end_time\": \"18:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:29\", \"end_time\": \"19:29\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:45\", \"end_time\": \"20:45\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"20:55\", \"end_time\": \"21:55\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nExplanation of key corrections:\n1. Joshua meeting: Start adjusted to 19:45 (correct 16-min travel from Embarcadero)\n2. Brian meeting: Start adjusted to 20:55 (correct 10-min travel from Alamo Square)\n3. All meetings now strictly adhere to:\n   - Minimum durations (45-120 mins)\n   - Availability windows (end times before friends' windows close)\n   - Travel time constraints (using given district-to-district times)\n\nThe schedule meets:\n- Jeffrey (12:00-12:45, 45 mins)\n- Charles (13:15-15:00, 105 mins)\n- Robert (15:18-16:48, 90 mins)\n- Kimberly (17:00-18:15, 75 mins)\n- Karen (18:29-19:29, 60 mins)\n- Joshua (19:45-20:45, 60 mins)\n- Brian (20:55-21:55, 60 mins)",
