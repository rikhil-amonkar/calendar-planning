    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo meet all four friends while adhering to their availability and minimum meeting durations, the optimal schedule minimizes travel time and waiting periods. Starting at Bayview at 9:00 AM, the sequence is:  \n1. Meet Joseph at Russian Hill first, as he is available early and this avoids initial waiting.  \n2. Then meet Jeffrey at Financial District, arriving shortly after his start time.  \n3. Next, meet Nancy at Alamo Square, within her window.  \n4. Finally, meet Jason at North Beach, as he is only available late in the day.  \n\nTravel times are incorporated between meetings:  \n- Bayview to Russian Hill: 23 min (arrive 9:23 AM).  \n- Russian Hill to Financial District: 11 min (leave 10:23 AM, arrive 10:34 AM).  \n- Financial District to Alamo Square: 17 min (leave 11:19 AM, arrive 11:36 AM).  \n- Alamo Square to North Beach: 15 min (leave 4:30 PM to arrive at 4:45 PM for Jason).  \n\nFree time occurs from 1:06 PM to 4:30 PM (3 hours 24 minutes) after meeting Nancy, as Jason's availability starts late. This is unavoidable but allows for personal time.  \n\nMeeting schedule in chronological order:  \n- Joseph: 9:23 AM to 10:23 AM (60 minutes at Russian Hill).  \n- Jeffrey: 10:34 AM to 11:19 AM (45 minutes at Financial District).  \n- Nancy: 11:36 AM to 1:06 PM (90 minutes at Alamo Square).  \n- Jason: 4:45 PM to 5:00 PM (15 minutes at North Beach).  \n\nJSON output:  \n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:23AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:23AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:34AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:19AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:36AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:06PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:00PM\"}]}",
