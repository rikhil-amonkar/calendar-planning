        "content": "SOLUTION: To meet all three friends while adhering to the constraints and minimizing waiting time, the optimal schedule is as follows:\n\n- Start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM and travel to Alamo Square, arriving at 12:00 PM to meet Timothy. Since Timothy is available from 12:00 PM to 4:15 PM and the minimum required meeting time is 105 minutes, meet for the full available period (12:00 PM to 4:15 PM, which is 255 minutes, exceeding the minimum).\n- After meeting Timothy, travel from Alamo Square to Russian Hill (13 minutes), arriving at 4:28 PM. Joseph is available from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM, so wait until 4:45 PM to start the meeting. Meet Joseph for 106 minutes (from 4:45 PM to 6:31 PM), exceeding the 60-minute minimum.\n- After meeting Joseph, travel from Russian Hill to Presidio (14 minutes), arriving at 6:45 PM to meet Mark. Mark is available from 6:45 PM to 9:00 PM, so meet for exactly 60 minutes (from 6:45 PM to 7:45 PM).\n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met with minimal waiting (only 17 minutes before meeting Joseph). Travel times are accounted for between meetings, but only the meeting actions are included in the itinerary as per the JSON format requirement.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Timothy\", \"start_time\": \"12:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:15PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"4:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:31PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mark\", \"start_time\": \"6:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:45PM\"}]}"
