Timothy is available from 12:00 PM to 4:15 PM, and the meeting must last at least 105 minutes. To minimize waiting and align with subsequent meetings, meet Timothy from 2:30 PM to 4:15 PM (105 minutes).  \n- Travel to Russian Hill (13 minutes) to meet Joseph. Joseph is available from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM, and the meeting must last at least 60 minutes. Arrive at Russian Hill at approximately 4:28 PM, wait until 4:45 PM, and meet Joseph from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM (60 minutes).  \n- Travel to Presidio (14 minutes) to meet Mark. Mark is available from 6:45 PM to 9:00 PM, and the meeting must last at least 60 minutes. Arrive at Presidio at approximately 5:59 PM, wait until 6:45 PM, and meet Mark from 6:45 PM to 7:45 PM (60 minutes).  \n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met with efficient travel, minimizing unnecessary waiting while allowing all friends to be visited within their availability windows.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:15 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:45 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:45 PM\"}]}",
