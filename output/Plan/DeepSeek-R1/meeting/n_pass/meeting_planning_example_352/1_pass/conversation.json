        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nTo maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints (minimum meeting times, travel times, and availability windows), the optimal schedule involves meeting all four friends: Sandra, Nancy, Joseph, and Karen. The sequence starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM, with the first meeting at Chinatown (Sandra) shortly after arrival. After considering various sequences and travel times, the schedule that minimizes waiting and fits all meetings within the constraints is as follows:\n\n- **Sandra at Chinatown:** Available from 7:15 AM to 7:15 PM, with a minimum meeting time of 75 minutes. Start at 9:07 AM after traveling from Union Square (7 minutes), end at 10:22 AM.\n- **Nancy at Marina District:** Available from 11:00 AM to 8:15 PM, with a minimum meeting time of 105 minutes. Travel from Chinatown to Marina District takes 12 minutes, arriving at 10:34 AM. Since Nancy is available from 11:00 AM, wait until then to start. Meet from 11:00 AM to 12:45 PM.\n- **Joseph at Haight-Ashbury:** Available from 12:30 PM to 7:45 PM, with a minimum meeting time of 90 minutes. Travel from Marina District to Haight-Ashbury takes 16 minutes, arriving at 1:01 PM.

To arrive by 9:15 PM, depart Haight-Ashbury by 9:00 PM (but can be done earlier with waiting). Meet from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM.\n\nThis schedule meets all friends for at least their minimum time, adheres to travel times, and has minimal waiting periods (e.g., 26 minutes before meeting Nancy and free time after Joseph until traveling to Karen). Total meeting time is 300 minutes (5 hours), with travel time totaling 50 minutes.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:07 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:22 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"11:00 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:45 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"1:01 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:31 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:45 PM\"}]}"
