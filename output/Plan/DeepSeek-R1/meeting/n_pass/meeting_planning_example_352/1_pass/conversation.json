The itinerary minimizes waiting time by scheduling meetings later in the day to reduce the gap before meeting Karen at 9:15 PM. The schedule includes:  \n- Sandra at Chinatown from 2:46 PM to 4:01 PM (75 minutes).  \n- Nancy at Marina District from 4:13 PM to 5:58 PM (105 minutes).  \n- Joseph at Haight-Ashbury from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM (90 minutes).  \n- Karen at Nob Hill from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM (30 minutes).  \n\nThis sequence ensures efficient travel with minimal idle time. From 9:00 AM to 2:39 PM, you are at Union Square (not a meeting, so not in the itinerary). Travel times are accounted for between meetings, but only the meeting actions are included in the JSON output.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sandra\", \"start_time\": \"2:46 PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:01 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Nancy\", \"start_time\": \"4:13 PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:58 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"6:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:45 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"9:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:45 PM\"}]}"
