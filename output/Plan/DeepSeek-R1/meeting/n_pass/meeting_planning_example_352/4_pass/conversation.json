The sequence starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM, with the first meeting at Chinatown (Sandra) shortly after arrival. After considering various sequences and travel times, the schedule that minimizes waiting and fits all meetings within the constraints is as follows:\n\n- **Sandra at Chinatown:** Available from 7:15 AM to 7:15 PM, with a minimum meeting time of 75 minutes. Start at 9:07 AM after traveling from Union Square (7 minutes), end at 10:22 AM.\n- **Nancy at Marina District:** Available from 11:00 AM to 8:15 PM, with a minimum meeting time of 105 minutes.

Meet from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM.\n\nThis schedule meets all friends for at least their minimum time, adheres to travel times, and has minimal waiting periods (e.g., 26 minutes before meeting Nancy and free time after Joseph until traveling to Karen).
