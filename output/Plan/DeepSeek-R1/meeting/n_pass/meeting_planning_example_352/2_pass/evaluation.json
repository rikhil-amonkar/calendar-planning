    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints, the key violation in the previous solution was related to Karen's meeting time. Although Karen's availability is from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM (a fixed 30-minute window), the schedule required departing Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 PM to arrive exactly at 9:15 PM. However, this left no buffer for unexpected delays and was not explicitly stated in the output. The revised schedule ensures Karen's meeting is prioritized by adjusting Joseph's meeting to end earlier, allowing safer travel time to Nob Hill while maintaining all minimum meeting durations.\n\n**Revised Optimal Schedule:**\n1. **Sandra at Chinatown (75 min):**  \n   Start: 9:07 AM (after 7-min travel from Union Square)  \n   End: 10:22 AM\n2. **Nancy at Marina District (105 min):**  \n   Start: 11:00 AM (after 12-min travel + 26-min wait)  \n   End: 12:45 PM\n3. **Joseph at Haight-Ashbury (90 min):**  \n   Start: 1:01 PM (after 16-min travel)  \n   End: 2:31 PM\n4. **Karen at Nob Hill (30 min):**  \n   Start: 9:15 PM (arrive early via 15-min travel departing by 9:00 PM)  \n   End: 9:45 PM\n\n**Validation:**\n- **Sandra:** 9:07 AM\u201310:22 AM (75 min, within 7:15 AM\u20137:15 PM).\n- **Nancy:** 11:00 AM\u201312:45 PM (105 min, within 11:00 AM\u20138:15 PM).\n- **Joseph:** 1:01 PM\u20132:31 PM (90 min, within 12:30 PM\u20137:45 PM).\n- **Karen:** 9:15 PM\u20139:45 PM (30 min, exact availability window).\n- **Travel times:**  \n  - Union Square \u2192 Chinatown: 7 min (9:00 AM \u2192 9:07 AM).  \n  - Chinatown \u2192 Marina District: 12 min (10:22 AM \u2192 10:34 AM).  \n  - Marina District \u2192 Haight-Ashbury: 16 min (12:45 PM \u2192 1:01 PM).  \n  - Haight-Ashbury \u2192 Nob Hill: 15 min (depart \u22649:00 PM \u2192 arrive 9:15 PM).\n\nThis schedule meets all friends for their minimum durations within availability windows, with travel times fully accounted for. The gap after Joseph (2:31 PM\u20139:00 PM) is free time.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:07 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:22 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"11:00 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:45 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"1:01 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:31 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:45 PM\"}]}",
