    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nThe optimal schedule allows you to meet all nine friends while satisfying the minimum meeting time requirements and accounting for travel times between locations. You start at Presidio at 9:00 AM and end by meeting Karen at Haight-Ashbury from 9:00 PM to 9:45 PM. The schedule is designed to minimize waiting time and ensure all meetings fit within the friends' availability windows. Below is the meeting schedule in chronological order, with travel times included implicitly (e.g., after each meeting, you travel directly to the next location).\n\n- **Jason (Chinatown)**: 9:21 AM to 10:36 AM (75 minutes, within availability 8:15 AM to 11:45 AM).  \n  - Arrive at Chinatown at 9:21 AM after 21-minute travel from Presidio.\n- **Mark (Marina District)**: 10:48 AM to 12:03 PM (75 minutes, within availability 10:15 AM to 1:00 PM).  \n  - Arrive at Marina District at 10:48 AM after 12-minute travel from Chinatown.\n- **Kenneth (North Beach)**: 12:14 PM to 12:44 PM (30 minutes, within availability 9:45 AM to 9:00 PM).  \n  - Arrive at North Beach at 12:14 PM after 11-minute travel from Marina District.\n- **Kimberly (Embarcadero)**: 12:50 PM to 2:05 PM (75 minutes, within availability 9:45 AM to 7:30 PM).  \n  - Arrive at Embarcadero at 12:50 PM after 6-minute travel from North Beach.\n- **Jessica (Nob Hill)**: 2:15 PM to 3:45 PM (90 minutes, within availability 1:45 PM to 9:00 PM).  \n  - Arrive at Nob Hill at 2:15 PM after 10-minute travel from Embarcadero.\n- **Stephanie (Union Square)**: 3:52 PM to 5:37 PM (105 minutes, within availability 2:45 PM to 6:45 PM).  \n  - Arrive at Union Square at 3:52 PM after 7-minute travel from Nob Hill.\n- **Brian (Russian Hill)**: 5:50 PM to 6:50 PM (60 minutes, within availability 3:30 PM to 9:45 PM).  \n  - Arrive at Russian Hill at 5:50 PM after 13-minute travel from Union Square.\n- **Steven (Financial District)**: 7:01 PM to 8:01 PM (60 minutes, within availability 7:15 AM to 9:15 PM).  \n  - Arrive at Financial District at 7:01 PM after 11-minute travel from Russian Hill.\n- **Karen (Haight-Ashbury)**: 9:00 PM to 9:45 PM (45 minutes, within availability 9:00 PM to 9:45 PM).  \n  - Arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 8:20 PM after 19-minute travel from Financial District, with a 40-minute wait until the meeting starts.\n\nThis schedule meets all minimum time requirements and has only one significant waiting period (40 minutes before meeting Karen), which is unavoidable due to her fixed start time. All travel times are based on the provided distances and are accounted for in the arrival times.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:21\", \"end_time\": \"10:36\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:48\", \"end_time\": \"12:03\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:14\", \"end_time\": \"12:44\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:50\", \"end_time\": \"14:05\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:15\", \"end_time\": \"15:45\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:52\", \"end_time\": \"17:37\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:50\", \"end_time\": \"18:50\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:01\", \"end_time\": \"20:01\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"21:00\", \"end_time\": \"21:45\"}]}",
