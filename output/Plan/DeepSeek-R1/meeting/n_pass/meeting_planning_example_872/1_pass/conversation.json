        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule meets all nine friends while respecting the minimum meeting times and availability constraints. The itinerary starts at Presidio at 9:00 AM and ends at Haight-Ashbury for Karen at 9:00 PM. Travel times are accounted for between meetings, and the schedule ensures that all meetings start and end within the friends' availability windows. The waiting time before meeting Karen is minimized but unavoidable due to her late availability.\n\nThe meeting itinerary in JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:21\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:36\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:48\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:03\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:14\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:44\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:50\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:05\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:50\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:50\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Steven\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:54\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:54\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Schedule:\n- **Start at Presidio (9:00 AM)**: Travel to Chinatown takes 21 minutes, arriving at 9:21 AM.\n- **Jason (Chinatown)**: Met from 9:21 AM to 10:36 AM (75 minutes, within 8:15 AM to 11:45 AM).\n- **Travel to Marina District**: 12 minutes, arriving at 10:48 AM.\n- **Mark (Marina District)**: Met from 10:48 AM to 12:03 PM (75 minutes, within 10:15 AM to 1:00 PM).\n- **Travel to North Beach**: 11 minutes, arriving at 12:14 PM.\n- **Kenneth (North Beach)**: Met from 12:14 PM to 12:44 PM (30 minutes, within 9:45 AM to 9:00 PM).\n- **Travel to Embarcadero**: 6 minutes, arriving at 12:50 PM.\n- **Kimberly (Embarcadero)**: Met from 12:50 PM to 2:05 PM (75 minutes, within 9:45 AM to 7:30 PM).\n- **Travel to Nob Hill**: 10 minutes, arriving at 2:15 PM.\n- **Jessica (Nob Hill)**: Met from 2:15 PM to 3:45 PM (90 minutes, within 1:45 PM to 9:00 PM).\n- **Travel to Russian Hill**: 5 minutes, arriving at 3:50 PM.\n- **Brian (Russian Hill)**: Met from 3:50 PM to 4:50 PM (60 minutes, within 3:30 PM to 9:45 PM).\n- **Travel to Union Square**: 10 minutes, arriving at 5:00 PM.\n- **Stephanie (Union Square)**: Met from 5:00 PM to 6:45 PM (105 minutes, within 2:45 PM to 6:45 PM).\n- **Travel to Financial District**: 9 minutes, arriving at 6:54 PM.\n- **Steven (Financial District)**: Met from 6:54 PM to 7:54 PM (60 minutes, within 7:15 AM to 9:15 PM).\n- **Travel to Haight-Ashbury**: 19 minutes, arriving at 8:13 PM.
