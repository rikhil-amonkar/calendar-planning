    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule meets six friends: Betty, Anthony, Melissa, Joshua, Jeffrey, and Emily. The violations in the previous schedule were related to travel time miscalculations and meeting window constraints. Specifically:\n\n1. **Anthony's meeting end time exceeded availability**: The previous schedule ended at 1:00 PM, but Anthony's window closes at 1:30 PM. The meeting duration was correct (75 minutes), but the travel time to the next meeting was underestimated.\n2. **Travel time miscalculations**: \n   - Russian Hill to Chinatown is 9 minutes (not 10).\n   - Chinatown to Alamo Square is 17 minutes (correctly used, but the arrival needed adjustment).\n   - The schedule now ensures all travel times align with the table and respect meeting windows.\n\nThe revised schedule adheres to all constraints:\n- **Betty (Russian Hill)**: 9:13 AM\u201310:58 AM (105 min within 7:00 AM\u20134:45 PM).\n- **Anthony (Chinatown)**: 11:45 AM\u20131:00 PM (75 min within 11:45 AM\u20131:30 PM).\n- **Melissa (Alamo Square)**: 1:17 PM\u20133:02 PM (105 min within 9:30 AM\u20135:15 PM).\n- **Joshua (Haight-Ashbury)**: 3:07 PM\u20134:37 PM (90 min within 12:15 PM\u20137:00 PM).\n- **Jeffrey (Marina District)**: 4:54 PM\u20135:39 PM (45 min within 12:15 PM\u20136:00 PM).\n- **Emily (Sunset District)**: 7:30 PM\u20139:30 PM (120 min within 7:30 PM\u20139:30 PM).\n\n**Travel validation**:\n- Union Square \u2192 Russian Hill: 13 min (arrive 9:13 AM).\n- Russian Hill \u2192 Chinatown: 9 min (leave 10:58 AM, arrive 11:07 AM; wait until 11:45 AM).\n- Chinatown \u2192 Alamo Square: 17 min (leave 1:00 PM, arrive 1:17 PM).\n- Alamo Square \u2192 Haight-Ashbury: 5 min (leave 3:02 PM, arrive 3:07 PM).\n- Haight-Ashbury \u2192 Marina District: 17 min (leave 4:37 PM, arrive 4:54 PM).\n- Marina District \u2192 Sunset District: 19 min (leave 5:39 PM, arrive 5:58 PM; wait until 7:30 PM).\n\nJames and Timothy could not be included without violating other constraints. This schedule maximizes meetings while honoring all time windows and travel durations.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:13\", \"end_time\": \"10:58\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"13:00\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"13:17\", \"end_time\": \"15:02\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:07\", \"end_time\": \"16:37\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"16:54\", \"end_time\": \"17:39\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:30\", \"end_time\": \"21:30\"}]}",
