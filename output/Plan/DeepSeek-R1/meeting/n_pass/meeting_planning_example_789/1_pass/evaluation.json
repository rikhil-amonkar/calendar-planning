    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule allows meeting 6 friends while satisfying the minimum time requirements and accounting for travel times. The friends met are Betty, Melissa, Timothy, Jeffrey, Joshua, and Emily. Anthony and James cannot be included without violating constraints or minimum time requirements due to conflicts with other meetings and travel times.  \n\nThe itinerary is as follows:  \n- Start at Union Square at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel to Russian Hill (13 minutes) to meet Betty from 9:13 AM to 10:58 AM (105 minutes).  \n- Travel to Alamo Square (15 minutes) to meet Melissa from 11:13 AM to 12:58 PM (105 minutes).  \n- Travel to Presidio (17 minutes) to meet Timothy from 1:15 PM to 2:45 PM (90 minutes).  \n- Travel to Marina District (11 minutes) to meet Jeffrey from 2:56 PM to 3:41 PM (45 minutes).  \n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury (16 minutes) to meet Joshua from 3:57 PM to 7:00 PM (183 minutes, exceeding the 90-minute minimum).  \n- Travel to Sunset District (15 minutes) to meet Emily from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM (120 minutes).  \n\nThis schedule maximizes the number of friends met by grouping meetings in proximity where possible (e.g., Russian Hill and Marina District are close, but Jeffrey's later availability required adjustment) and leveraging Joshua's location near Sunset District for efficient travel to Emily. Anthony and James are excluded because their inclusion would require sacrificing another meeting due to tight time windows and travel conflicts.  \n\nJSON output:  \n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:13AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:58AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:13AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:58PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Timothy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:15PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"2:45PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"2:56PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"3:41PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"3:57PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"7:00PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Emily\",\n      \"start_time\": \"7:30PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"9:30PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
