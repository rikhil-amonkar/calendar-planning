    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo maximize the number of friends met while respecting the minimum meeting times and travel constraints, the optimal schedule meets 6 friends: Betty, Anthony, Melissa, Joshua, Jeffrey, and Emily. The schedule is designed to start at Union Square at 9:00 AM and efficiently sequence meetings based on location proximity, travel times, and availability windows. Anthony and Timothy cannot both be met due to overlapping windows and insufficient travel time, so Timothy is excluded. James is excluded because his minimum 90-minute meeting cannot be fitted without conflicting with Emily's fixed 7:30 PM start at Sunset District. The schedule includes:\n\n- Betty at Russian Hill from 9:13 AM to 10:58 AM (105 minutes).\n- Anthony at Chinatown from 11:45 AM to 1:00 PM (75 minutes, within his 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM window).\n- Melissa at Alamo Square from 1:17 PM to 3:02 PM (105 minutes).\n- Joshua at Haight-Ashbury from 3:07 PM to 4:37 PM (90 minutes).\n- Jeffrey at Marina District from 4:54 PM to 5:39 PM (45 minutes).\n- Emily at Sunset District from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM (120 minutes).\n\nTravel times are accounted for between meetings, and there is free time from 5:39 PM to 7:11 PM to travel from Marina District to Sunset District (19 minutes, leaving at 7:11 PM to arrive by 7:30 PM).\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:13\", \"end_time\": \"10:58\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"13:00\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"13:17\", \"end_time\": \"15:02\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:07\", \"end_time\": \"16:37\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"16:54\", \"end_time\": \"17:39\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:30\", \"end_time\": \"21:30\"}]}",
