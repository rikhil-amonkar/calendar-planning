        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nAfter evaluating the constraints and travel times, it is impossible to meet Robert for the minimum required 90 minutes due to the late arrival at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM and Robert's availability ending at 10:30 AM. The maximum meeting time possible with Robert is 75 minutes (from 9:15 AM to 10:30 AM), which is insufficient. Therefore, the optimal schedule meets 5 friends: Steven, Anthony, Sandra, Stephanie, and Kevin. The schedule is designed to minimize travel time and ensure all minimum meeting times are satisfied within the availability windows.\n\n- Start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM.\n- First, travel to Golden Gate Park (7 minutes) to meet Steven from 9:07 AM to 10:22 AM (75 minutes).\n- Next, travel to Alamo Square (10 minutes) to meet Anthony from 10:32 AM to 10:47 AM (15 minutes).\n- Then, travel from Alamo Square to Pacific Heights (10 minutes), arriving at 2:45 PM to meet Sandra from 2:45 PM to 3:30 PM (45 minutes).\n- After a break, travel from Pacific Heights to Russian Hill (7 minutes), arriving at 8:00 PM to meet Stephanie from 8:00 PM to 8:15 PM (15 minutes).\n- Finally, travel to Fisherman's Wharf (7 minutes) to meet Kevin from 8:22 PM to 9:37 PM (75 minutes).\n\nAll travel times are accounted for, and the schedule ensures no overlaps or conflicts.
