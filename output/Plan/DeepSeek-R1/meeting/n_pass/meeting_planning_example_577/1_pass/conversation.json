All other friends are met with their minimum times satisfied, resulting in 5 out of 6 friends met.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Anthony\", \"start_time\": \"9:05 AM\", \"end_time\": \"9:20 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Steven\", \"start_time\": \"9:29 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:44 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sandra\", \"start_time\": \"2:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:30 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Stephanie\", \"start_time\": \"8:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:15 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kevin\", \"start_time\": \"8:22 PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:37 PM\"}]}"
