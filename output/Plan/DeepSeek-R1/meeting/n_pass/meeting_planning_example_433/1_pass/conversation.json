        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nTo meet all five friends while adhering to the constraints and minimizing waiting time, the optimal schedule is as follows:  \n- Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Jeffrey first, as he has the earliest availability and a long minimum meeting time.  \n- Then proceed to The Castro to meet Deborah, aligning the end of Jeffrey's meeting with the start of Deborah's availability to reduce waiting.  \n- Next, travel to the Financial District to meet Margaret, with a later start to reduce waiting for Ronald.  \n- After Margaret, go to North Beach to meet Ronald, starting at his earliest availability to accommodate his tight window.  \n- Finally, travel to Richmond District to meet Emily, arriving after her start time but with sufficient time for the minimum meeting.  \n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met and all friends are visited, with a total waiting time of 65 minutes (57 minutes at the Financial District and 8 minutes at North Beach). Travel times are accounted for in the meeting start and end times.  \n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:  \n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"2:00 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Deborah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"2:13 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"3:43 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Margaret\",\n      \"start_time\": \"5:00 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"6:15 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Ronald\",\n      \"start_time\": \"6:30 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"7:15 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Emily\",\n      \"start_time\": \"7:33 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"7:48 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
