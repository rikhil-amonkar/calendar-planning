The revised schedule builds in buffers while meeting all minimum duration requirements and availability windows.\n\n**Optimized Schedule:**\n- **Jeffrey at Golden Gate Park:** 11:15 AM - 1:30 PM (135 min > 120 min required)  \n  *Travel from Nob Hill: 17 min (leave 10:58 AM, arrive 11:15 AM)*\n- **Deborah at The Castro:** 1:45 PM - 4:10 PM (145 min > 90 min required)  \n  *Travel: 13 min (leave 1:30 PM, arrive 1:43 PM; wait 2 min)*\n- **Margaret at Financial District:** 4:30 PM - 5:45 PM (75 min required)  \n  *Travel: 20 min (leave 4:10 PM, arrive 4:30 PM)*\n- **Ronald at North Beach:** 6:30 PM - 7:15 PM (45 min required)  \n  *Travel: 7 min (leave 5:45 PM, arrive 5:52 PM; wait 38 min)*\n- **Emily at Richmond District:** 7:33 PM - 7:48 PM (15 min required)  \n  *Travel: 18 min (leave 7:15 PM, arrive 7:33 PM)*\n\n**Key Improvements:**\n1. Added 38-min buffer before Ronald to absorb any delays\n2. Maintained exact minimum durations for Margaret, Ronald, and Emily\n3. Preserved all arrival times within friends' availability windows\n4. All travel times validated against provided distance matrix\n\nSOLUTION:\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:15AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:30PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:10PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:45PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:15PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:33PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:48PM\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
