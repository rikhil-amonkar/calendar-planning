    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints and travel times, the initial schedule was adjusted to ensure all minimum meeting durations are fully satisfied and travel times are accurately accounted for. The revised schedule meets five friends: Melissa, Rebecca, Richard, Margaret, and Matthew, while respecting all time windows and travel constraints.\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n1. **Richard's Meeting**: Extended to 90 minutes within availability (3:15 PM\u20136:45 PM) by starting earlier.\n2. **Travel Time Validation**: All travel durations re-verified using provided symmetric travel times (e.g., Embarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf is 6 minutes, Fisherman's Wharf to Russian Hill is 7 minutes).\n3. **Meeting Duration Compliance**: Each meeting meets or exceeds minimum durations without overlapping windows.\n\n### Optimized Schedule:\n- **9:00 AM**: Start at Chinatown.\n- **Melissa (Golden Gate Park)**: 1:45 PM\u20133:15 PM (90 minutes).  \n  *Travel from Chinatown: 23 minutes (leave 1:22 PM, arrive 1:45 PM).*\n- **Rebecca (Haight-Ashbury)**: 3:22 PM\u20134:22 PM (60 minutes).  \n  *Travel from Golden Gate Park: 7 minutes (leave 3:15 PM, arrive 3:22 PM).*\n- **Richard (Embarcadero)**: 4:43 PM\u20136:13 PM (90 minutes).  \n  *Travel from Haight-Ashbury: 21 minutes (leave 4:22 PM, arrive 4:43 PM).*\n- **Margaret (Fisherman's Wharf)**: 6:19 PM\u20136:34 PM (15 minutes).  \n  *Travel from Embarcadero: 6 minutes (leave 6:13 PM, arrive 6:19 PM).*\n- **Matthew (Russian Hill)**: 6:41 PM\u20138:11 PM (90 minutes).  \n  *Travel from Fisherman's Wharf: 7 minutes (leave 6:34 PM, arrive 6:41 PM).*\n\n### Why Other Friends Couldn't Be Included:\n- **George (The Castro)**: Requires 75 minutes between 2:00 PM\u20134:15 PM. Conflicts with Melissa's meeting and travel.\n- **Mark (Pacific Heights)**: Requires 45 minutes between 3:00 PM\u20135:00 PM. Overlaps with Rebecca and Richard.\n- **Emily (Sunset District)**: Requires 45 minutes between 3:45 PM\u20135:00 PM. Insufficient time after Melissa/Rebecca.\n\nThis schedule maximizes meetings while adhering to all constraints.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:45PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"3:15PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"3:22PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"4:22PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"4:43PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"6:13PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"6:19PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"6:34PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"6:41PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"8:11PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
