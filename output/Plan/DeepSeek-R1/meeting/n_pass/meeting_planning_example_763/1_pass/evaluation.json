    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: After evaluating various schedules to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all minimum meeting durations and time windows, the optimal itinerary meets five friends: Melissa, Rebecca, Richard, Matthew, and Margaret. The schedule accounts for travel times between locations and ensures all meetings start and end within the specified availability windows while meeting or exceeding the minimum duration requirements. The meetings are sequenced to minimize travel time and conflicts.\n\nThe itinerary in JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:22\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:22\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:42\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:12\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Matthew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:20\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:50\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Margaret\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:57\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:12\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Schedule:\n- **Start at Chinatown (9:00 AM)**: You begin the day at Chinatown but have no meetings scheduled until the afternoon. You depart for Golden Gate Park at 1:22 PM (23-minute travel) to arrive by 1:45 PM.\n- **Meet Melissa (1:45 PM - 3:15 PM)**: At Golden Gate Park for 90 minutes, within her window (1:45 PM - 5:30 PM).\n- **Travel to Haight-Ashbury (7 minutes)**: Depart Golden Gate Park at 3:15 PM, arrive at 3:22 PM.\n- **Meet Rebecca (3:22 PM - 4:22 PM)**: At Haight-Ashbury for 60 minutes, within her window (2:45 PM - 6:00 PM).\n- **Travel to Embarcadero (20 minutes)**: Depart Haight-Ashbury at 4:22 PM, arrive at 4:42 PM.\n- **Meet Richard (4:42 PM - 6:12 PM)**: At Embarcadero for 90 minutes, within his window (3:15 PM - 6:45 PM).\n- **Travel to Russian Hill (8 minutes)**: Depart Embarcadero at 6:12 PM, arrive at 6:20 PM.\n- **Meet Matthew (6:20 PM - 7:50 PM)**: At Russian Hill for 90 minutes, within his window (5:30 PM - 9:00 PM).\n- **Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (7 minutes)**: Depart Russian Hill at 7:50 PM, arrive at 7:57 PM.\n- **Meet Margaret (7:57 PM - 8:12 PM)**: At Fisherman's Wharf for 15 minutes, within her window (2:45 PM - 8:15 PM).\n\n### Why This Schedule is Optimal:\n- **Meets 5 friends**: This is the maximum achievable while honoring all constraints. George, Mark, and Emily could not be included without violating minimum durations or time windows due to travel time conflicts (e.g., George's early end time at 4:15 PM conflicted with Melissa's meeting, and Emily/Mark had tight windows that couldn't be fitted).\n- **Travel Times Optimized**: The sequence (Golden Gate Park \u2192 Haight-Ashbury \u2192 Embarcadero \u2192 Russian Hill \u2192 Fisherman's Wharf) minimizes travel time based on the given matrix, with no backtracking.\n- **All Minimum Durations Met**: Each meeting meets or exceeds the required minimum time (Melissa: 90 min, Rebecca: 60 min, Richard: 90 min, Matthew: 90 min, Margaret: 15 min).\n- **No Window Violations**: All meetings occur entirely within the friends' availability windows.",
