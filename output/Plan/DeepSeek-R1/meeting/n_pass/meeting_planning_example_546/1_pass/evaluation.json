    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nI have optimized the schedule to meet all six friends while respecting the minimum meeting times, availability constraints, and travel times. The schedule starts from Embarcadero at 9:00 AM and sequences meetings to minimize waiting and travel time. Key decisions include:  \n- Meeting Nancy first in Pacific Heights due to her early end time (11:30 AM), starting at 9:11 AM after 11 minutes of travel.  \n- Meeting Lisa in Union Square next, as it is close and fills the gap before Andrew's availability.  \n- Meeting Andrew in Nob Hill starting as soon as possible after Lisa.  \n- Meeting Joshua in Financial District after Andrew, taking advantage of his flexible window.  \n- Meeting John in Bayview later in the evening to align with Kenneth's late availability, starting John at 7:35 PM to minimize waiting for Kenneth.  \n- Meeting Kenneth last in Richmond District, starting exactly at 9:15 PM after 25 minutes of travel from Bayview.  \n\nAll minimum meeting times are met, and travel times are accounted for between meetings. The free time from 1:11 PM to 7:16 PM is used for rest or slow travel, as no other friends are available during this period.  \n\nThe meeting schedule in the required JSON format is:  \n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:11\", \"end_time\": \"10:41\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:53\", \"end_time\": \"11:38\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:47\", \"end_time\": \"12:47\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:56\", \"end_time\": \"13:11\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:35\", \"end_time\": \"20:50\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"21:15\", \"end_time\": \"21:45\"}]}",
