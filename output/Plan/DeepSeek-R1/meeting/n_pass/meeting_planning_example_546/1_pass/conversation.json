The itinerary starts from Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. Travel times are accounted for between meetings, ensuring all meetings fit within the friends' availability windows. The schedule includes meetings with Nancy, Lisa, Joshua, Andrew, John, and Kenneth, each meeting for at least their minimum required time.\n\n- Nancy is met first due to her early availability window (8:00 AM to 11:30 AM), starting after travel from Embarcadero to Pacific Heights (11 minutes).\n- Lisa is met next at Union Square, as it is close and her window (9:00 AM to 4:30 PM) allows flexibility.\n- Joshua is met at Financial District during his availability (12:00 PM to 3:15 PM), with a short 15-minute meeting.\n- Andrew is met at Nob Hill after Joshua, utilizing Andrew's long availability window (11:30 AM to 8:15 PM).\n- John is met at Bayview later in the evening, starting at 7:50 PM to allow time for travel to Kenneth afterward.\n- Kenneth is met last at Richmond District, starting at 9:30 PM to meet for exactly 30 minutes within his window (9:15 PM to 10:00 PM).\n\nThe free time between Andrew and John (from 1:23 PM to 7:50 PM) is not included in the itinerary but is used for rest or other activities. All travel times are incorporated, and no constraints are violated.\n\nJSON output:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:11\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:41\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Lisa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:53\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:38\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Andrew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:23\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:23\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"John\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:50\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:05\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
