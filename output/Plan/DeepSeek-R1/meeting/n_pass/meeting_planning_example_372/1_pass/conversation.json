The optimal schedule involves meeting Daniel first at Golden Gate Park shortly after arrival, then meeting Margaret at Russian Hill for an extended period to minimize idle time later, followed by meeting Charles at Alamo Square starting later in the evening to align with Stephanie's availability at Mission District. The schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met and travel times are accounted for, with unavoidable idle time between the daytime and evening meetings.\n\nThe itinerary in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Daniel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:11 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"9:26 AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Margaret\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:47 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"4:00 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Charles\",\n      \"start_time\": \"6:50 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"8:20 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"8:30 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:00 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
