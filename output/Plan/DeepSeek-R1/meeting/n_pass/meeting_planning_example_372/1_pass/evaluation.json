Starting at Sunset District at 9:00 AM, the sequence is:  \n1. Meet Daniel at Golden Gate Park first (arrive at 9:11 AM, meet from 9:11 AM to 9:26 AM for 15 minutes).  \n2. Travel to Russian Hill to meet Margaret (arrive at 9:45 AM, meet from 9:45 AM to 10:15 AM for 30 minutes).  \n3. After free time, travel to Alamo Square to meet Charles (arrive at 6:50 PM, meet from 6:50 PM to 8:20 PM for 90 minutes).  \n4. Travel to Mission District to meet Stephanie (arrive at 8:30 PM, meet from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM for 90 minutes).  \n\nThis schedule minimizes idle time between meetings, with only necessary travel and waiting periods. All constraints are satisfied, and all friends are met.  \n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:11 AM\", \"end_time\": \"9:26 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:45 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:15 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:50 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:20 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"8:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"10:00 PM\"}]}",
