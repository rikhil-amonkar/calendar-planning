    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nTo meet all three friends while adhering to the constraints and minimizing waiting time, the optimal schedule is as follows:\n\n- Start at Union Square at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Sunset District to meet Carol first, as she has the earliest availability window (10:15 AM to 11:45 AM). To minimize waiting, meet Carol from 11:15 AM to 11:45 AM (30 minutes, meeting the minimum requirement).\n- After meeting Carol, travel directly to Bayview to meet Karen. Travel time from Sunset District to Bayview is 22 minutes, so depart Sunset District at 11:45 AM and arrive at Bayview at 12:07 PM. Wait until Karen's availability starts at 12:45 PM, then meet from 12:45 PM to 2:45 PM (120 minutes, meeting the minimum requirement).\n- After meeting Karen, travel directly to Mission District to meet Rebecca. Travel time from Bayview to Mission District is 13 minutes, so depart Bayview at 2:45 PM and arrive at Mission District at 2:58 PM. Meet Rebecca from 2:58 PM to 4:58 PM (120 minutes, meeting the minimum requirement, within her availability until 8:15 PM).\n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met with reasonable travel and waiting times, allowing you to meet all three friends.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:15AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:45AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:45PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:58PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:58PM\"}]}",
