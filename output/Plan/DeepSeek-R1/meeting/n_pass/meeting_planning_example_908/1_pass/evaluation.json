    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule allows meeting 9 friends: Mark, Ashley, Brian, Joseph, Stephanie, Lisa, Patricia, William, and Karen. Betty cannot be included without conflicting with the tight time constraints of other friends, particularly Patricia, William, and Karen. The schedule starts at the Financial District at 9:00 AM and efficiently sequences meetings to minimize travel time and meet the minimum duration requirements. The meetings are ordered as follows, with travel times accounted for between locations:\n\n1. **Mark** at Fisherman's Wharf: Start at 9:10 AM (arrive after 10 min travel from Financial District), end at 9:40 AM (30 min meeting within Mark's 8:15 AM to 10:00 AM window).\n2. **Ashley** at Richmond District: Start at 9:58 AM (arrive after 18 min travel from Fisherman's Wharf), end at 10:43 AM (45 min meeting within Ashley's 9:45 AM to 11:15 AM window).\n3. **Brian** at The Castro: Start at 10:59 AM (arrive after 16 min travel from Richmond District), end at 11:29 AM (30 min meeting within Brian's 9:15 AM to 1:15 PM window).\n4. **Joseph** at Marina District: Start at 11:50 AM (arrive after 21 min travel from The Castro), end at 1:20 PM (90 min meeting within Joseph's 10:45 AM to 3:00 PM window).\n5. **Stephanie** at Presidio: Start at 1:30 PM (arrive after 10 min travel from Marina District), end at 2:45 PM (75 min meeting within Stephanie's 12:15 PM to 3:00 PM window).\n6. **Lisa** at Haight-Ashbury: Start at 3:30 PM (arrive after 15 min travel from Presidio, with a 30 min wait from 3:00 PM due to Lisa's 3:30 PM start), end at 4:15 PM (45 min meeting within Lisa's 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM window).\n7. **Patricia** at Union Square: Start at 4:34 PM (arrive after 19 min travel from Haight-Ashbury), end at 6:34 PM (120 min meeting within Patricia's 4:30 PM to 8:00 PM window; start is slightly late but still meets minimum duration).\n8. **William** at Russian Hill: Start at 6:47 PM (arrive after 13 min travel from Union Square), end at 7:47 PM (60 min meeting within William's 6:45 PM to 8:00 PM window; start is slightly late but still meets minimum duration).\n9. **Karen** at Sunset District: Start at 8:10 PM (arrive after 23 min travel from Russian Hill), end at 9:55 PM (105 min meeting within Karen's 4:30 PM to 10:00 PM window).\n\nBetty (Bayview) is not included because attempts to fit her 15 min meeting resulted in conflicts, such as insufficient time for Patricia, William, or Karen. For example, inserting Betty between Stephanie and Lisa or after other meetings caused arrival times that missed minimum durations for later friends. This schedule maximizes the number of meetings (9) while respecting all constraints.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:10 AM\", \"end_time\": \"09:40 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:58 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:43 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:59 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:29 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:50 AM\", \"end_time\": \"01:20 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"01:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"02:45 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"03:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"04:15 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"04:34 PM\", \"end_time\": \"06:34 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"06:47 PM\", \"end_time\": \"07:47 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"08:10 PM\", \"end_time\": \"09:55 PM\"}]}",
