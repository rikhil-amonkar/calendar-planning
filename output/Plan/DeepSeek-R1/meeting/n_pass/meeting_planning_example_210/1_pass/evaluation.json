    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nThe optimal schedule meets all three friends while satisfying the minimum meeting durations and accounting for travel times. Starting from Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM, the itinerary begins by meeting Melissa first at the Financial District, as she has the earliest availability. After meeting Melissa, travel to Presidio to meet Emily, and then to Richmond District to meet Joseph. This sequence ensures that all minimum meeting times are met within the friends' availability windows, with travel times factored in between meetings.\n\nThe meeting schedule is as follows:\n- Meet Melissa from 15:45 to 17:00 (75 minutes) at the Financial District.\n- Travel from Financial District to Presidio takes 22 minutes, arriving at 17:22.\n- Meet Emily from 17:22 to 19:07 (105 minutes) at Presidio.\n- Travel from Presidio to Richmond District takes 7 minutes, arriving at 19:14.\n- Meet Joseph from 19:14 to 21:14 (120 minutes) at Richmond District.\n\nThis schedule meets all friends for the minimum required times without exceeding their availability.
