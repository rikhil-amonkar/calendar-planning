        "content": "SOLUTION: After evaluating various schedules, the optimal plan meets 8 friends while satisfying all minimum meeting durations and time constraints. The schedule starts at the Richmond District at 9:00 AM and sequences meetings to minimize travel time and conflicts. Key decisions include meeting Matthew first due to his early end time, grouping downtown meetings (Melissa, Robert, Jessica) for efficiency, and prioritizing Karen and Laura in the evening to avoid missing Laura, as meeting Deborah would conflict with meeting Laura. Deborah is excluded to enable meeting Laura after Karen, as both options (Deborah or Laura) result in 8 meetings, but meeting Laura is feasible with the travel times.\n\nThe meeting schedule in JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:13\", \"end_time\": \"10:43\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"friend\": \"Matthew\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:58\", \"end_time\": \"11:43\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"friend\": \"Melissa\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:46\", \"end_time\": \"13:46\", \"location\": \"Chinatown\", \"friend\": \"Robert\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:15\", \"end_time\": \"15:00\", \"location\": \"Sunset District\", \"friend\": \"David\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:15\", \"location\": \"Embarcadero\", \"friend\": \"Mark\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"16:19\", \"end_time\": \"17:04\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"friend\": \"Jessica\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:30\", \"end_time\": \"21:30\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"friend\": \"Karen\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"21:52\", \"end_time\": \"22:07\", \"location\": \"Bayview\", \"friend\": \"Laura\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n### Explanation of Schedule:\n- **9:00 AM**: Arrive at Richmond District.\n- **9:13\u201310:43 AM**: Meet Matthew at Alamo Square for 90 minutes (travel from Richmond: 13 min).\n- **10:58\u201311:43 AM**: Meet Melissa at North Beach for 45 minutes (travel from Alamo Square: 15 min).\n- **11:46 AM\u20131:46 PM**: Meet Robert at Chinatown for 120 minutes (travel from North Beach: 3 min).\n- **2:15\u20133:00 PM**: Meet David at Sunset District for 45 minutes (travel from Chinatown: 29 min; David available from 12:30 PM, but arrival at 2:15 is within window).\n- **3:30\u20134:15 PM**: Meet Mark at Embarcadero for 45 minutes (travel from Sunset District: 30 min; Mark available from 3:15 PM).\n- **4:19\u20135:04 PM**: Meet Jessica at Financial District for 45 minutes (travel from Embarcadero: 4 min).\n- **7:30\u20139:30 PM**: Meet Karen at Golden Gate Park for 120 minutes (travel from Financial District: 26 min; arrive early at 5:30 PM and wait until start time).\n- **9:52\u201310:07 PM**: Meet Laura at Bayview for 15 minutes (travel from Golden Gate Park: 22 min; Laura available until 10:15 PM).\n\n### Why this schedule?\n- **Meets 8 friends**: Matthew, Melissa, Robert, David, Mark, Jessica, Karen, and Laura are all met with minimum durations satisfied.\n- **Deborah excluded**: Meeting Deborah (only available 7:00\u20137:45 PM at Presidio) would require travel from Financial District (22 min), but then meeting Karen would start late (7:57 PM), ending at 9:57 PM, and traveling to Bayview (22 min) would arrive at 10:19 PM, missing Laura (ends at 10:15 PM). Skipping Deborah allows meeting Laura.\n- **Efficient travel**: Groups nearby districts (e.g., North Beach, Chinatown, Financial District) to minimize transit. Total idle time is minimized (e.g., waiting at Golden Gate Park from 5:30\u20137:30 PM is acceptable).\n- **Constraints handled**: All meetings fit within friends' availability windows, and travel times are accounted for. For example, Robert's 120-minute meeting is scheduled early, and Mark's short window is accommodated."
