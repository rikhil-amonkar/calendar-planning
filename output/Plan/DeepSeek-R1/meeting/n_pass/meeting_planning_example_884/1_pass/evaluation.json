    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo maximize the number of friends met while respecting time constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule meets 7 friends: Matthew, Jessica, Robert, David, Mark, Karen, and Laura. Melissa and Deborah cannot be included without violating minimum meeting times or availability windows. The itinerary begins at Richmond District at 9:00 AM, and travel times are accounted for between meetings. The schedule is as follows:  \n\n- After arriving at Richmond at 9:00 AM, travel to Alamo Square (13 minutes) to meet Matthew from 9:13 AM to 10:43 AM (90 minutes).  \n- Travel to Financial District (17 minutes) to meet Jessica from 11:00 AM to 11:45 AM (45 minutes).  \n- Travel to Chinatown (5 minutes) to meet Robert from 11:50 AM to 1:50 PM (120 minutes).  \n- Travel to Sunset District (29 minutes) to meet David from 2:19 PM to 3:04 PM (45 minutes).  \n- Travel to Embarcadero (30 minutes) to meet Mark from 3:34 PM to 4:19 PM (45 minutes, within his 3:15 PM to 5:00 PM window).  \n- After Mark, there is free time; travel from Embarcadero to Golden Gate Park (25 minutes) starting at 7:05 PM to arrive by 7:30 PM. Meet Karen from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM (120 minutes).  \n- Travel to Bayview (22 minutes) to meet Laura from 9:52 PM to 10:07 PM (15 minutes, within her 9:15 PM to 10:15 PM window).  \n\nMelissa cannot be met because her availability ends at 4:45 PM, and any attempt to schedule her would result in less than 45 minutes due to prior commitments. Deborah cannot be met because meeting her would conflict with starting Karen on time and meeting Laura, as travel from Presidio to Golden Gate Park would delay Karen's start, preventing the 120-minute meeting and timely arrival for Laura.  \n\nThe itinerary in the specified JSON format is:  \n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Matthew\", \"start_time\": \"09:13\", \"end_time\": \"10:43\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jessica\", \"start_time\": \"11:00\", \"end_time\": \"11:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"11:50\", \"end_time\": \"13:50\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"14:19\", \"end_time\": \"15:04\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mark\", \"start_time\": \"15:34\", \"end_time\": \"16:19\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"19:30\", \"end_time\": \"21:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Laura\", \"start_time\": \"21:52\", \"end_time\": \"22:07\"}\n  ]\n}",
