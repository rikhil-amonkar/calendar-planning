    "execution_output": "To meet exactly 8 friends while adhering to minimum time requirements and availability windows, the optimal schedule includes Matthew, Melissa, Jessica, Robert, David, Mark, Karen, and Laura. Deborah cannot be included without violating multiple constraints. The itinerary ensures all minimum meeting times are met except for Mark, who is met for 35 minutes (slightly short of the 45-minute requirement) due to his availability window ending at 5:00 PM. Travel times are accounted for between locations.\n\n**Schedule Justification:**\n- **Matthew (90 min):** Starts immediately after arrival and travel to Alamo Square (9:13 AM), within his availability (8:45 AM-1:45 PM).\n- **Melissa (45 min):** Scheduled after Matthew by traveling to North Beach (15 min), within her availability (7:15 AM-4:45 PM).\n- **Jessica (45 min):** Traveled to Financial District (8 min) after Melissa, within her availability (9:30 AM-6:45 PM).\n- **Robert (120 min):** Traveled to Chinatown (5 min) after Jessica, within his availability (7:45 AM-5:30 PM).\n- **David (45 min):** Traveled to Sunset District (29 min) after Robert, within his availability (12:30 PM-7:45 PM).\n- **Mark (35 min):** Traveled to Embarcadero (30 min) after David. Starts at 4:25 PM (within 3:15 PM-5:00 PM window) but ends at 5:00 PM due to his availability cutoff.\n- **Karen (120 min):** Traveled to Golden Gate Park after free time (25 min). Starts at 7:30 PM, within her availability (7:30 PM-10:00 PM).\n- **Laura (15 min):** Traveled to Bayview (22 min) after Karen. Starts at 9:52 PM, within her availability (9:15 PM-10:15 PM).\n\n**Constraints Met:**\n- All minimum times satisfied except Mark (35 min < 45 min), as his window ends at 5:00 PM.\n- Laura met on time: Travel from Golden Gate Park to Bayview (22 min) completed by 9:52 PM.\n- No overlap; travel times fully accounted for.\n\n**JSON Itinerary:**\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Matthew\", \"start_time\": \"09:13\", \"end_time\": \"10:43\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Melissa\", \"start_time\": \"10:58\", \"end_time\": \"11:43\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jessica\", \"start_time\": \"11:51\", \"end_time\": \"12:36\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"12:41\", \"end_time\": \"14:41\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"15:10\", \"end_time\": \"15:55\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mark\", \"start_time\": \"16:25\", \"end_time\": \"17:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"19:30\", \"end_time\": \"21:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Laura\", \"start_time\": \"21:52\", \"end_time\": \"22:07\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
