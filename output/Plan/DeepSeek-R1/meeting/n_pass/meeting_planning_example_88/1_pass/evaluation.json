    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo meet as many friends as possible while ensuring the constraint with Joshua is satisfied, consider the following:  \n- You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00 AM and can meet friends there until you depart for Golden Gate Park.  \n- Joshua is only available at Golden Gate Park from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM, and you must meet him for at least 15 minutes.  \n- Travel time from Sunset District to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes, so to meet Joshua, you must arrive at Golden Gate Park by 9:30 PM at the latest (to allow for a 15-minute meeting ending at 9:45 PM).  \n- The latest departure time from Sunset District is 9:30 PM minus 11 minutes = 9:19 PM.  \n- You can depart earlier to spend more time at Golden Gate Park, potentially meeting other friends there before Joshua's availability.  \n- Since no other friends or specific availabilities are given, the total meeting time (time spent at locations meeting friends) is fixed regardless of when you depart Sunset District, as long as you arrive at Golden Gate Park by 9:30 PM. The total meeting time is from 9:00 AM to departure time at Sunset, plus from arrival time to 9:45 PM at Golden Gate Park, minus travel time.  \n- To optimize for meeting as many friends as possible (with no additional information), a balanced schedule is chosen where you arrive at Golden Gate Park at 8:45 PM to maximize time there, including the full window with Joshua. This allows for meeting friends at both locations:  \n  - Sunset District meeting: 9:00 AM to 8:34 PM (departure time for 11-minute travel to arrive at Golden Gate Park at 8:45 PM).  \n  - Golden Gate Park meeting: 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM (includes meeting Joshua for 60 minutes).  \n\nThis schedule ensures you meet Joshua for the required minimum of 15 minutes and maximizes potential time at both locations for meeting other friends.  \n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:  \n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"today\", \"start_time\": \"09:00\", \"end_time\": \"20:34\"}, {\"day\": \"today\", \"start_time\": \"20:45\", \"end_time\": \"21:45\"}]}",
