Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nSunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11.\nGolden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM. Joshua will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:45PM to 9:45PM. You'd like to meet Joshua for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nPlease output the meeting schedule in the following JSON format:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"<DAY>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}]}"

The total meeting time is from 9:00 AM to departure time at Sunset, plus from arrival time to 9:45 PM at Golden Gate Park, minus travel time.  \n- To optimize for meeting as many friends as possible (with no additional information), a balanced schedule is chosen where you arrive at Golden Gate Park at 8:45 PM to maximize time there, including the full window with Joshua. This allows for meeting friends at both locations:  \n  - Sunset District meeting: 9:00 AM to 8:34 PM (departure time for 11-minute travel to arrive at Golden Gate Park at 8:45 PM).  \n  - Golden Gate Park meeting: 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM (includes meeting Joshua for 60 minutes).  \n\nThis schedule ensures you meet Joshua for the required minimum of 15 minutes and maximizes potential time at both locations for meeting other friends.  \n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:  \n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"today\", \"start_time\": \"09:00\", \"end_time\": \"20:34\"}, {\"day\": \"today\", \"start_time\": \"20:45\", \"end_time\": \"21:45\"}]}"
