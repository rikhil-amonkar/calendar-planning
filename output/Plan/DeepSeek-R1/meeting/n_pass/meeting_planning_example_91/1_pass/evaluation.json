Since no other friends or meetings are specified, the only goal is to meet Daniel for at least 75 minutes, as per the constraints.  \n- Daniel is available at Richmond District from 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM, which is exactly 75 minutes. To meet for the full duration, you must be present for the entire window.  \n- Travel time from Russian Hill to Richmond District is 14 minutes, so you should leave Russian Hill by 6:46 PM to arrive at Richmond District by 7:00 PM. However, the meeting schedule only includes the actual meeting time, not travel.  \n- With no other friends or constraints provided, this is the only meeting possible, and it optimizes the goal of meeting Daniel for the required 75 minutes.  \n- The day is specified as \"Visit_Day\" since the exact date is not given in the problem. Times are in 24-hour format as per the JSON requirement.",
