The arrival time at 10:40 AM is within the window, but to ensure a more efficient schedule and meet all constraints robustly, the schedule has been revised to start George's meeting closer to his availability start time while still meeting all minimum time requirements.\n\nRevised Schedule:\n- Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (29 minutes), arriving at 9:29 AM.\n- Meet Robert from 9:29 AM to 9:59 AM (30 minutes, within his 9:00 AM to 1:45 PM availability).\n- Travel to Chinatown (12 minutes), departing at 9:59 AM, arriving at 10:11 AM.\n- Meet Michelle from 10:11 AM to 10:26 AM (15 minutes, within her 8:15 AM to 2:00 PM availability).\n- Travel to Presidio (19 minutes), departing at 10:26 AM, arriving at 10:45 AM.\n- Meet George from 10:45 AM to 11:15 AM (30 minutes, within his 10:30 AM to 6:45 PM availability).\n- Free time until evening.\n- Travel from Presidio to Russian Hill (14 minutes), departing at 6:16 PM, arriving at 6:30 PM.\n- Meet William from 6:30 PM to 8:15 PM (105 minutes, within his 6:30 PM to 8:45 PM availability).\n\nThis schedule meets all four friends, satisfies all minimum time requirements, and accounts for travel times within the availability windows.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:29\", \"end_time\": \"09:59\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:11\", \"end_time\": \"10:26\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:45\", \"end_time\": \"11:15\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:30\", \"end_time\": \"20:15\"}]}",
