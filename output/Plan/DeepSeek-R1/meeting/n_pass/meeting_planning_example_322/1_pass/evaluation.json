    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo meet as many friends as possible while satisfying the minimum time requirements and accounting for travel times, the optimal schedule involves meeting all four friends: Michelle, Robert, George, and William. The sequence minimizes travel time by grouping morning meetings efficiently and ensuring timely arrival for William in the evening.  \n\n- Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel to Chinatown (30 minutes) to meet Michelle first, as she has the earliest availability and shortest minimum time.  \n- Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf (8 minutes) to meet Robert.  \n- Next, travel to Presidio (17 minutes) to meet George.  \n- Finally, travel to Russian Hill (14 minutes) to meet William, arriving by 6:30 PM.  \n\nThis schedule meets all minimum time requirements:  \n- Michelle: 15 minutes met (9:30 AM to 9:45 AM).  \n- Robert: 30 minutes met (9:53 AM to 10:23 AM).  \n- George: 30 minutes met (10:40 AM to 11:10 AM).  \n- William: 105 minutes met (6:30 PM to 8:15 PM).  \n\nTotal travel time is 69 minutes, and there is no conflict with availability windows.  \n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:  \n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:30\", \"end_time\": \"09:45\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:53\", \"end_time\": \"10:23\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:40\", \"end_time\": \"11:10\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:30\", \"end_time\": \"20:15\"}]}",
