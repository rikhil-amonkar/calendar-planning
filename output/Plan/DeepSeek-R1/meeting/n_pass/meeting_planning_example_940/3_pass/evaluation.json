    "execution_output": "After carefully re-evaluating the travel times and meeting constraints, I've identified two key issues in the previous schedule that violated constraints: (1) The travel time from Marina District to Pacific Heights was incorrectly calculated as 6 minutes when it should be 7 minutes according to the travel matrix, and (2) Kevin's meeting was unnecessarily delayed to 8:45 PM despite arriving at 8:22 PM. The revised schedule corrects these issues while maintaining 8 meetings and respecting all constraints.\n\n**Revised Optimal Schedule (8 friends met):**\n\n1. **Jessica (Russian Hill):** 9:13 AM - 11:13 AM (120 min)  \n   *Travel to Nob Hill: 5 min*\n2. **Nancy (Nob Hill):** 11:18 AM - 12:03 PM (45 min)  \n   *Travel to North Beach: 8 min*\n3. **John (North Beach):** 12:11 PM - 12:26 PM (15 min)  \n   *Travel to Sunset District: 27 min*\n4. **Rebecca (Sunset District):** 12:53 PM - 2:08 PM (75 min)  \n   *Travel to Marina District: 21 min*\n5. **Jason (Marina District):** 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM (120 min, within 3:00-5:30 PM window)  \n   *Travel to Pacific Heights: 7 min (corrected from 6 min)*\n6. **Sarah (Pacific Heights):** 5:30 PM - 6:15 PM (45 min)  \n   *Travel to Fisherman's Wharf: 13 min*\n7. **Mark (Fisherman's Wharf):** 6:28 PM - 8:00 PM (92 min, min 90 met)  \n   *Travel to Mission District: 22 min*\n8. **Kevin (Mission District):** 8:22 PM - 9:22 PM (60 min, starts immediately upon arrival)  \n\n**Key Corrections:**\n- \u2705 **Travel time correction:** Marina District \u2192 Pacific Heights now correctly uses 7 min travel time (was 6 min).\n- \u2705 **Kevin's meeting:** Starts at 8:22 PM (immediately after arrival) instead of 8:45 PM, eliminating unnecessary waiting while fully respecting availability (8:00-10:00 PM).\n- \u2705 **Jason's meeting:** Adjusted to 3:00-5:00 PM to align with availability window (3:00-5:30 PM).\n\n**Why Karen & Amanda cannot be included:**\n- **Karen (Chinatown, 4:45-7:00 PM):** Conflicts with Jason (until 5:00 PM) and Sarah (starts 5:30 PM). Travel time (Marina \u2192 Chinatown = 12 min) would require meeting Karen between 5:12-5:30 PM (18 min < 60 min minimum).\n- **Amanda (The Castro, 8:00-9:15 PM):** Conflicts with Kevin (ends 9:22 PM). Travel Mission \u2192 Castro (18 min) would require arriving at 9:40 PM (after Amanda's window ends at 9:15 PM).\n\n**Feasibility Note:** Meeting 9 friends remains impossible without violating minimum durations or availability windows due to tight travel constraints between geographically dispersed locations.\n\nSOLUTION:\nThe revised schedule meets 8 friends (Jessica, Nancy, John, Rebecca, Jason, Sarah, Mark, Kevin) while strictly adhering to all minimum durations, travel times, and availability windows. Karen and Amanda cannot be accommodated due to spatiotemporal conflicts.\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:13\", \"end_time\": \"11:13\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:18\", \"end_time\": \"12:03\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:11\", \"end_time\": \"12:26\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:53\", \"end_time\": \"14:08\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:00\", \"end_time\": \"17:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:30\", \"end_time\": \"18:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:28\", \"end_time\": \"20:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"20:22\", \"end_time\": \"21:22\"}\n  ]\n}",
