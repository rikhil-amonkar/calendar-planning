The schedule accounts for travel times between locations, starting from Alamo Square at 9:00 AM. Margaret cannot be met due to a time conflict with Andrew, as travel times make it impossible to meet both within their availability windows while satisfying minimum durations.  \n\nThe meeting schedule in JSON format is as follows:  \n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:08AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:08AM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"10:28AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:13AM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"12:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:00PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"2:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:45PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"3:57PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:50PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"8:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:30PM\"}]}  \n\nThis schedule meets:  \n- George at The Castro for 60 minutes.  \n- Deborah at Chinatown for 45 minutes.  \n- Emily at Russian Hill for 105 minutes.  \n- Mark at Presidio for 60 minutes.  \n- Steven at Golden Gate Park for 233 minutes (exceeding the minimum 105 minutes).  \n- Andrew at Embarcadero for 75 minutes.  \n\nMargaret at Sunset District is not met due to the conflict with Andrew. The schedule maximizes the number of friends met (six out of seven) while adhering to all constraints."
