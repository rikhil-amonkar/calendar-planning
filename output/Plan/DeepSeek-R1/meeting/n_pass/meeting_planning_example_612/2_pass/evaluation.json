    "execution_output": "After re-evaluating the constraints and travel times, I've developed an optimized schedule that meets 6 friends while respecting all minimum meeting durations and availability windows. The key improvements are:\n\n1. Meeting Margaret instead of Andrew to avoid the impossible time conflict (travel from Embarcadero to Sunset District takes 30 minutes, leaving insufficient time for Margaret's 60-minute requirement after Andrew's meeting).\n\n2. Adjusted Steven's meeting duration to end earlier (8:57PM) to allow travel to Margaret's location while staying within Steven's availability (ends 9:15PM).\n\n3. Maintained all other meetings at their minimum required durations with optimized travel sequencing.\n\n**Validated Schedule:**\n- George (The Castro): 9:08AM-10:08AM (60 min, within 7:30AM-2:15PM)\n- Deborah (Chinatown): 10:28AM-11:13AM (45 min, within 7:30AM-3:30PM)\n- Emily (Russian Hill): 12:15PM-2:00PM (105 min, within 12:15PM-2:15PM)\n- Mark (Presidio): 2:45PM-3:45PM (60 min, within 2:45PM-7:30PM)\n- Steven (Golden Gate Park): 3:57PM-8:57PM (300 min > 105 min, within 11:15AM-9:15PM)\n- Margaret (Sunset District): 9:30PM-10:30PM (60 min, within 9:30PM-10:30PM)\n\n**Travel Validation:**\n- Start at Alamo Square (9:00AM) \u2192 The Castro (8 min travel, arrive 9:08AM)\n- The Castro \u2192 Chinatown (20 min, arrive 10:28AM)\n- Chinatown \u2192 Russian Hill (7 min, arrive 11:20AM, wait until 12:15PM)\n- Russian Hill \u2192 Presidio (14 min, arrive 2:14PM, wait until 2:45PM)\n- Presidio \u2192 Golden Gate Park (12 min, arrive 3:57PM)\n- Golden Gate Park \u2192 Sunset District (10 min, arrive 9:07PM, wait until 9:30PM)\n\nAll minimum durations and availability windows are satisfied. Meeting Andrew is impossible without violating Margaret's constraints given the 30-minute travel time between Embarcadero and Sunset District.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [\n  {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:08AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:08AM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"10:28AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:13AM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"12:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:00PM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"2:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:45PM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"3:57PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:57PM\"},\n  {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"10:30PM\"}\n]}",
