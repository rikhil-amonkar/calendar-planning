        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nTo meet Robert for the minimum required 120 minutes while optimizing the schedule to potentially free up time for other friends (though none are specified beyond Robert), the best approach is to start the meeting as early as possible within Robert's availability. This allows for the remainder of the day to be available for other activities or meetings.  \n\n- You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel from Nob Hill to Presidio takes 17 minutes.  \n- Robert is available at Presidio from 11:15 AM to 5:45 PM.  \n\nTo minimize waiting time and start the meeting promptly at 11:15 AM:  \n- Leave Nob Hill at 10:58 AM (calculated as 11:15 AM minus 17 minutes).  \n- Arrive at Presidio at 11:15 AM.  \n- Start the meeting at 11:15 AM and end at 1:15 PM (120 minutes duration).  \n\nThis schedule ensures you meet Robert for exactly 120 minutes, satisfying the constraint, and frees up the afternoon (from 1:15 PM onwards) for other potential friends or activities. Although no other friends are mentioned, this early meeting maximizes flexibility.  \n\nThe meeting schedule in the required JSON format is:  \n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"13:15\"}]}"
