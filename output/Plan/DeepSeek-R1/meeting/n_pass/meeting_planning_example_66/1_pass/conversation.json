Therefore, the optimal schedule focuses on meeting Robert for the required minimum of 120 minutes. Since you start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM and Robert is available at Presidio from 11:15 AM to 5:45 PM, the best schedule is to leave Nob Hill at 10:58 AM to arrive at Presidio exactly at 11:15 AM (travel time: 17 minutes). You then meet Robert from 11:15 AM to 1:15 PM, which satisfies the 120-minute requirement. After the meeting, you have the option to return to Nob Hill or stay, but no other friends or activities are mentioned, so the itinerary includes only the meeting with Robert.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"11:15AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:15PM\"}]}"
