This minimizes waiting time and maximizes flexibility for other activities or meetings later in the day.  \n\n- You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel from Nob Hill to Presidio takes 17 minutes.  \n- Robert is available at Presidio from 11:15 AM to 5:45 PM.  \n\nTo start the meeting promptly at 11:15 AM:  \n- Leave Nob Hill at 10:58 AM (arriving at Presidio at 11:15 AM).  \n- Meet Robert from 11:15 AM to 1:15 PM (120 minutes).  \n- After the meeting, you are free from 1:15 PM onward, allowing time to travel to other locations or meet other friends if possible.  \n\nThis schedule ensures the 120-minute meeting constraint is satisfied and leaves the afternoon open for additional opportunities.  \n\nMeeting schedule in JSON format:  \n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"13:15\"}]}",
