    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule allows meeting six friends: David, Deborah, Kenneth, John, Karen, and Charles. Carol cannot be met due to the travel time from Chinatown to Presidio (19 minutes) resulting in an arrival at 9:19AM, after Carol's availability ends at 9:15AM. The schedule minimizes idle time where possible, but some waiting is unavoidable due to the constraints. Travel times are accounted for between meetings, but only the meeting actions are included in the itinerary.\n\nThe itinerary in JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:18AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:03AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Deborah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:20AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:50AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"2:00PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"4:00PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"John\",\n      \"start_time\": \"5:00PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"5:15PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"5:45PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"6:00PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Charles\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:45PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Schedule:\n- **Start at Chinatown (9:00AM)**: Arrive and immediately depart for Mission District.\n- **Meet David (Mission District, 9:18AM\u201310:03AM)**: Travel from Chinatown to Mission District takes 18 minutes (arrive 9:18AM). Meet for 45 minutes, satisfying the minimum.\n- **Travel to Golden Gate Park (10:03AM\u201310:20AM)**: 17-minute travel, arriving at 10:20AM.\n- **Meet Deborah (Golden Gate Park, 10:20AM\u201311:50AM)**: Meet for 90 minutes, ending before Deborah's availability ends at 6:15PM.\n- **Travel to Alamo Square (11:50AM\u201312:00PM)**: 10-minute travel, arriving at 12:00PM. Wait until Kenneth is available at 2:00PM (idle time not in itinerary).\n- **Meet Kenneth (Alamo Square, 2:00PM\u20134:00PM)**: Start exactly at 2:00PM for a 120-minute meeting, satisfying the minimum.\n- **Travel to Pacific Heights (4:00PM\u20134:10PM)**: 10-minute travel, arriving at 4:10PM. Wait until John is available at 5:00PM (idle time not in itinerary).\n- **Meet John (Pacific Heights, 5:00PM\u20135:15PM)**: Start at 5:00PM for a 15-minute meeting, satisfying the minimum.\n- **Travel to Sunset District (5:15PM\u20135:36PM)**: 21-minute travel, arriving at 5:36PM. Wait until Karen is available at 5:45PM (idle time not in itinerary).\n- **Meet Karen (Sunset District, 5:45PM\u20136:00PM)**: Start at 5:45PM for a 15-minute meeting, satisfying the minimum.\n- **Travel to Union Square (6:00PM\u20136:30PM)**: 30-minute travel, arriving at 6:30PM. Wait until Charles is available at 9:45PM (idle time not in itinerary).\n- **Meet Charles (Union Square, 9:45PM\u201310:45PM)**: Start at 9:45PM for a 60-minute meeting, satisfying the minimum.\n\n### Why this schedule meets the goals:\n- **Maximizes meetings**: All six possible friends are met (David, Deborah, Kenneth, John, Karen, Charles), as Carol is impossible.\n- **Satisfies constraints**: All minimum meeting times and availability windows are respected.\n- **Optimization**: The schedule groups geographically closer locations where possible (e.g., Golden Gate Park and Alamo Square are only 10 minutes apart) and sequences meetings to avoid conflicts. Idle time is minimized but necessary due to fixed availability (e.g., waiting for Kenneth at Alamo Square or Charles at Union Square). Deborah is met early to accommodate her 6:15PM end time, and evening meetings (John, Karen) are sequenced efficiently with short travel.",
