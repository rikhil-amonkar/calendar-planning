Leave Richmond at 1:51 PM to arrive at Marina by 2:00 PM, as travel takes 9 minutes. Meet Carol from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM for the required 60 minutes. Then, travel from Marina District to Pacific Heights, taking 7 minutes, arriving at 3:07 PM. Wait until Jessica's availability starts at 3:30 PM, then meet her from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM for exactly 45 minutes. This schedule minimizes waiting time between meetings and ensures both friends are met for the minimum required durations.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:00PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"3:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:15PM\"}]}",
