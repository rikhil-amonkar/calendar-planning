You start at Richmond District at 9:00 AM. To minimize idle time and ensure timely arrivals, meet Carol first at Marina District from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM (60 minutes, as required). After the meeting, travel to Pacific Heights (7 minutes), arriving at 3:07 PM. Jessica is available from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM, so meet her from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM (45 minutes, as required). This schedule ensures you meet both friends with minimal waiting time between activities.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"2:00 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"3:00 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"3:30 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"4:15 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
