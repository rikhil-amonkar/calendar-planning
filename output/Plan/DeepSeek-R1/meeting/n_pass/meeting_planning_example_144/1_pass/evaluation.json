Then, travel to Financial District, arriving at 1:47 PM (17 minutes travel time), and meet Anthony from 1:47 PM to 2:17 PM for the minimum required 30 minutes, which is within his availability window ending at 2:45 PM. This sequence minimizes total travel time (24 minutes) compared to alternative sequences and ensures both meetings are accommodated without any conflicts. The time from 9:00 AM to 12:08 PM is spent at The Castro with no meetings, as there are no other friends or activities specified.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Same Day\", \"start_time\": \"12:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:30PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Same Day\", \"start_time\": \"1:47PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:17PM\"}]}",
