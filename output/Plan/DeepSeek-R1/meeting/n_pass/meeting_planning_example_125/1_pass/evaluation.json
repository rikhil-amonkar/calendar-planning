I start at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. Since Stephanie's availability ends at 11:30 AM and requires a minimum of 90 minutes, I should meet her first to ensure enough time. John has a longer availability window (until 8:45 PM) and only requires 30 minutes, so meeting him after Stephanie is feasible.\n\n- Travel from Embarcadero to Financial District takes 5 minutes, arriving at 9:05 AM.\n- Meet Stephanie from 9:05 AM to 10:35 AM (90 minutes) at Financial District, within her availability (8:15 AM to 11:30 AM).\n- Travel from Financial District to Alamo Square takes 17 minutes, departing at 10:35 AM and arriving at 10:52 AM.\n- Meet John from 10:52 AM to 11:22 AM (30 minutes) at Alamo Square, within his availability (10:15 AM to 8:45 PM).\n\nThis schedule meets both friends with their minimum time requirements and is efficient, with no waiting time between activities.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Stephanie\", \"start_time\": \"09:05 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:35 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"John\", \"start_time\": \"10:52 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:22 AM\"}]}",
