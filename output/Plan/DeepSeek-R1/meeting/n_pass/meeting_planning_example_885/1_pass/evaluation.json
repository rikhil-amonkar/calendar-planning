    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nAfter evaluating various schedules, the optimal itinerary meets 7 friends while respecting all minimum meeting durations and time constraints. The schedule starts at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM and efficiently sequences meetings based on geographical proximity and time windows, minimizing travel time. Kevin and Nancy could not be included without violating constraints, as their minimum meeting durations and windows conflicted with other priorities.  \n\nThe itinerary in JSON format:  \n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Matthew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:19\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:04\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Andrew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:19\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:04\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:53\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:53\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Linda\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:12\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:57\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:24\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```  \n\n**Explanation of the schedule:**  \n- **9:30\u201311:00: Meet Karen at Financial District** (90 minutes, within 9:30 AM\u201312:45 PM). Travel from Russian Hill to Financial District takes 11 minutes; arrive at 9:11, wait until 9:30.  \n- **11:19\u201312:04: Meet Matthew at Haight-Ashbury** (45 minutes, within 10:15 AM\u20133:30 PM). Travel from Financial District to Haight-Ashbury takes 19 minutes; depart at 11:00, arrive at 11:19.  \n- **12:19\u201314:04: Meet Andrew at Nob Hill** (105 minutes, within 11:45 AM\u20134:45 PM). Travel from Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill takes 15 minutes; depart at 12:04, arrive at 12:19.  \n- **14:15\u201315:45: Meet Barbara at Alamo Square** (90 minutes, within 10:00 AM\u20137:30 PM). Travel from Nob Hill to Alamo Square takes 11 minutes; depart at 14:04, arrive at 14:15.  \n- **15:53\u201317:53: Meet David at The Castro** (120 minutes, within 9:00 AM\u20136:00 PM). Travel from Alamo Square to The Castro takes 8 minutes; depart at 15:45, arrive at 15:53.  \n- **18:12\u201318:57: Meet Linda at Bayview** (45 minutes, within 6:15 PM\u20137:45 PM). Travel from The Castro to Bayview takes 19 minutes; depart at 17:53, arrive at 18:12.  \n- **19:24\u201321:00: Meet Mark at Marina District** (96 minutes > 90 minimum, within 6:45 PM\u20139:00 PM). Travel from Bayview to Marina District takes 27 minutes; depart at 18:57, arrive at 19:24.  \n\n**Why Kevin and Nancy are not included:**  \n- Kevin (Sunset District, 10:00 AM\u20135:45 PM, min 120 minutes) conflicts with Andrew and Barbara in the afternoon. Fitting Kevin would require starting by 3:45 PM, but the schedule is occupied with Andrew until 2:04 PM and travel, making it impossible to meet the 120-minute minimum without violating other constraints.  \n- Nancy (Golden Gate Park, 4:45 PM\u20138:00 PM, min 105 minutes) conflicts with the sequence ending at David and the evening commitments to Linda and Mark. Starting Nancy by 6:15 PM is tight, and travel from David's location would delay Linda or Mark, risking their minimum times.  \n\nThis schedule maximizes meetings by prioritizing friends with tighter windows and grouping nearby districts (e.g., Haight-Ashbury to Castro is only 6 minutes, Alamo Square to Castro is 8 minutes). Total friends met: 7 out of 9.",
