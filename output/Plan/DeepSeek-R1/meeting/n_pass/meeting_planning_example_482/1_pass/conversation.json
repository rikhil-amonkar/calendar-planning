        "content": "SOLUTION:\nI considered various schedules to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints and minimum meeting times. Richard at Pacific Heights cannot be met because, starting from Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM, the earliest arrival is 9:12 AM, and with Richard available only until 10:15 AM, the maximum possible meeting time is 63 minutes, which is less than the required 75 minutes. Therefore, Richard is excluded.\n\nThe optimal schedule meets four friends: Stephanie at Mission District, Brian at Russian Hill, Sandra at Bayview, and Jason at Fisherman's Wharf. The schedule is as follows:\n- Start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Mission District (11 minutes), arriving at 9:11 AM. Meet Stephanie from 9:11 AM to 12:00 PM (169 minutes, exceeding the 90-minute minimum).\n- Travel to Russian Hill (15 minutes), arriving at 12:15 PM. Meet Brian from 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM (120 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Bayview (23 minutes), arriving at 2:38 PM. Meet Sandra from 2:38 PM to 2:53 PM (15 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (25 minutes), arriving at 3:18 PM. Meet Jason from 3:18 PM to 4:18 PM (60 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n\nThis schedule meets all constraints and minimum times for four friends, which is the maximum possible.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:11 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:00 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"02:15 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"02:38 PM\", \"end_time\": \"02:53 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"03:18 PM\", \"end_time\": \"04:18 PM\"}]}"
