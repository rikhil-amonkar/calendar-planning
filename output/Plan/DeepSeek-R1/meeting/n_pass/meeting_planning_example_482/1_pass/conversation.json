Meeting Richard is impossible because, starting from Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM, the earliest arrival at Pacific Heights is 9:12 AM, and with Richard's availability ending at 10:15 AM, only 63 minutes are available\u2014less than the required 75 minutes. The schedule below ensures all other meetings are feasible with the minimum times met, and travel times are accounted for between locations.\n\nThe itinerary is as follows:\n- Start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Mission District (11 minutes), arriving at 9:11 AM to meet Stephanie. She is available until 1:45 PM, so meet from 9:11 AM to 12:00 PM (169 minutes, exceeding the 90-minute minimum).\n- Travel to Russian Hill (15 minutes), arriving at 12:15 PM to meet Brian. He is available from 12:15 PM to 4:00 PM, so meet from 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM (exactly 120 minutes).\n- Travel to Bayview (23 minutes), arriving at 2:38 PM to meet Sandra. She is available until 7:30 PM, so meet from 2:38 PM to 2:53 PM (15 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (25 minutes), arriving at 3:18 PM to meet Jason. He is available until 5:45 PM, so meet from 3:18 PM to 4:18 PM (60 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n\nThis schedule meets four friends, which is the maximum possible given the constraints.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Stephanie\", \"start_time\": \"9:11AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:00PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"12:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:15PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sandra\", \"start_time\": \"2:38PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:53PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jason\", \"start_time\": \"3:18PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:18PM\"}]}"
