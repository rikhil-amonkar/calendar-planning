Richard remains impossible to meet due to insufficient time between our 9:00 AM start and his 10:15 AM availability end.\n\n**Optimal Schedule:**\n1. **Stephanie (Mission District):**  \n   - 9:11 AM to 10:41 AM (90 minutes exactly)  \n   - *Availability: 9:00 AM\u201312:00 PM (fully satisfied)*\n2. **Jason (Fisherman's Wharf):**  \n   - 11:03 AM to 12:03 PM (60 minutes exactly)  \n   - *Availability: 11:00 AM\u20131:00 PM (starts 3 min after window opens)*\n3. **Brian (Russian Hill):**  \n   - 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM (120 minutes exactly)  \n   - *Availability: 12:00 PM\u20132:15 PM (ends exactly at window close)*\n4. **Sandra (Bayview):**  \n   - 2:38 PM to 2:53 PM (15 minutes exactly)  \n   - *Availability: 2:00 PM\u20133:00 PM (fully satisfied)*\n\n**Travel Sequence:**\n- Start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM\n- \u2192 Mission District (11 min): 9:00\u20139:11 AM  \n- \u2192 Fisherman's Wharf (22 min): 10:41\u201311:03 AM  \n- \u2192 Russian Hill (7 min): 12:03\u201312:10 PM (5 min wait before Brian's meeting)  \n- \u2192 Bayview (23 min): 2:15\u20132:38 PM  \n\n**Key Improvements:**\n- Adjusted Brian's meeting to end exactly at his availability window close (2:15 PM)\n- Maintained all minimum meeting durations exactly\n- Eliminated any risk of window violations\n- Preserved travel time accuracy from provided table\n- Total friends met: 4 (maximum possible)\n\nThis schedule satisfies all constraints: all meetings occur within stated availability windows, meet minimum duration requirements, and travel times match the table exactly.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:11 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:41 AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:03 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:03 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"02:15 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"02:38 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"02:53 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
