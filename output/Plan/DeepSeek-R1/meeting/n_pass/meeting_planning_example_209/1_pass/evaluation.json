    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nThe optimal schedule allows you to meet all three friends while satisfying the minimum meeting durations and travel time constraints. You start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM. After considering various sequences, the best order is to meet Melissa first at North Beach, then Anthony at Chinatown, and finally Rebecca at Russian Hill. This sequence minimizes conflicts and ensures all minimum meeting times are met, with Melissa's meeting exceeding the minimum due to available time before Anthony's window.\n\n- **Melissa at North Beach**: You travel from Sunset District to North Beach (29 minutes), arriving at 9:29 AM. Melissa is available until 1:30 PM, but you must depart by 1:09 PM to reach Chinatown for Anthony by 1:15 PM. This gives a meeting duration of 3 hours 40 minutes (220 minutes), exceeding the minimum 105 minutes.\n  \n- **Anthony at Chinatown**: You travel from North Beach to Chinatown (6 minutes), arriving at 1:15 PM. Anthony is available until 2:30 PM, and you meet for the minimum 60 minutes, ending at 2:15 PM. This leaves free time until Rebecca's meeting.\n\n- **Rebecca at Russian Hill**: You travel from Chinatown to Russian Hill (7 minutes), arriving at 7:30 PM. Rebecca is available from 7:30 PM to 9:15 PM, and you meet for exactly 105 minutes, ending at 9:15 PM.\n\nThis schedule meets all constraints and allows you to maximize time with each friend where possible.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:29 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:09 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Anthony\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:15 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"2:15 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"7:30 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"9:15 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
