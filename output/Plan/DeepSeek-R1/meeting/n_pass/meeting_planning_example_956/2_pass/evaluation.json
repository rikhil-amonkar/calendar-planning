    "execution_output": "After carefully evaluating the travel times and availability constraints, I've determined that meeting all 10 friends within their specified time windows while fulfilling minimum meeting durations is mathematically impossible due to scheduling conflicts. The primary conflict arises between meeting David (Union Square, 45 minutes required between 4:45-7:15 PM) and Matthew (Mission District, 120 minutes required between 5:15-7:15 PM), as their time windows overlap critically with travel time constraints.\n\nThe optimized schedule meets 9 out of 10 friends by excluding David, as this allows us to:\n1. Fulfill all other minimum meeting durations\n2. Stay within all other time windows\n3. Minimize downtime between meetings\n4. Maximize the number of friends met\n\nHere's the revised schedule that meets all constraints for 9 friends:\n\n**SOLUTION:**\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:06\", \"end_time\": \"09:36\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:48\", \"end_time\": \"11:03\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:16\", \"end_time\": \"11:31\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:46\", \"end_time\": \"12:01\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:12\", \"end_time\": \"12:27\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"13:45\", \"end_time\": \"15:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:51\", \"end_time\": \"16:51\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:32\", \"end_time\": \"20:32\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n### Schedule Details:\n1. **Anthony (Haight-Ashbury)**: 9:06-9:36 AM  \n   - Travel from Castro: 6 min (arrive 9:06)\n   - Minimum 30 min met within 7:15-10:30 AM window\n\n2. **Helen (Pacific Heights)**: 9:48-11:03 AM  \n   - Travel from Haight-Ashbury: 12 min (arrive 9:48)\n   - Minimum 75 min met within 8:00 AM-12:00 PM window\n\n3. **Joseph (Financial District)**: 11:16-11:31 AM  \n   - Travel from Pacific Heights: 13 min (arrive 11:16)\n   - Minimum 15 min met within 11:15 AM-1:30 PM window\n\n4. **Karen (Marina District)**: 11:46 AM-12:01 PM  \n   - Travel from Financial District: 15 min (arrive 11:46)\n   - Minimum 15 min met within 11:30 AM-6:30 PM window\n\n5. **Joshua (Richmond District)**: 12:12-12:27 PM  \n   - Travel from Marina District: 11 min (arrive 12:12)\n   - Minimum 15 min met within 7:00 AM-8:00 PM window\n\n6. **Brian (Fisherman's Wharf)**: 1:45-3:30 PM  \n   - Travel from Richmond District: 18 min (arrive 12:45, wait until availability)\n   - Minimum 105 min met within 1:45-8:45 PM window\n\n7. **William (Alamo Square)**: 3:51-4:51 PM  \n   - Travel from Fisherman's Wharf: 21 min (arrive 3:51)\n   - Minimum 60 min met within 3:15-5:15 PM window\n\n8. **Matthew (Mission District)**: 5:15-7:15 PM  \n   - Travel from Alamo Square: 10 min (arrive 5:05, wait until availability)\n   - Minimum 120 min met within 5:15-7:15 PM window\n\n9. **Jeffrey (Golden Gate Park)**: 7:32-8:32 PM  \n   - Travel from Mission District: 17 min (arrive 7:32)\n   - Minimum 60 min met within 7:00-9:30 PM window\n\n### Why David couldn't be included:\n- David's window (4:45-7:15 PM) conflicts with the critical path between William (ends 4:51 PM) and Matthew (must start by 5:15 PM)\n- Attempting to meet David would either:\n  - Shorten Matthew's meeting below 120 minutes (minimum not met)\n  - Occur after Matthew when David's window has closed (7:15 PM)\n  - Overlap with Matthew's fixed meeting window\n- This is the maximum achievable while honoring all other constraints.",
