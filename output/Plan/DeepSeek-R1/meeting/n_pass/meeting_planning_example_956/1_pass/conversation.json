        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule meets 9 out of 10 friends, missing David due to conflicts with Matthew's fixed 120-minute meeting from 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM and travel constraints. David's availability (4:45 PM to 7:15 PM) overlaps with the end of William's meeting and the start of Matthew's meeting, leaving insufficient time to meet the 45-minute minimum without being late for Matthew or cutting meetings short.  \n\nThe itinerary maximizes meetings by starting early, leveraging short meetings for Joshua, Joseph, and Karen during gaps, and ensuring all minimum times are met. Travel times are accounted for between meetings.  \n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:  \n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Anthony\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:06\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:36\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:48\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:03\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:16\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:31\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:46\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:01\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:12\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:27\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"William\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:51\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:51\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Matthew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:32\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:32\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
