Meeting David is impossible due to the arrival time at Golden Gate Park conflicting with David's availability.

Travel times are accounted for between meetings, but only meet actions are included in the itinerary.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"09:24\", \"end_time\": \"10:54\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kevin\", \"start_time\": \"11:16\", \"end_time\": \"11:46\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"16:15\", \"end_time\": \"16:30\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"17:30\", \"end_time\": \"18:30\"}]}"
