        "content": "SOLUTION: It is impossible to meet David because his availability at Embarcadero ends at 9:00 AM, and you arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. Travel time to Embarcadero is 25 minutes, so you would arrive at 9:25 AM, after David has left. Therefore, you can meet a maximum of four friends. The optimal schedule that allows you to meet Joseph, Barbara, Kevin, and Jeffrey while respecting travel times and availability constraints is as follows:\n\n- Start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (24 minutes), arriving at 9:24 AM. Meet Joseph from 9:24 AM to 10:54 AM (90 minutes).\n- Travel to Financial District (11 minutes), arriving at 11:05 AM. Meet Barbara from 11:05 AM to 11:20 AM (15 minutes).\n- Travel to Mission District (17 minutes), arriving at 11:37 AM. Meet Kevin from 11:37 AM to 12:07 PM (30 minutes).\n- After free time, travel from Mission District to Bayview (15 minutes), leaving at 5:15 PM and arriving at 5:30 PM. Meet Jeffrey from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM (60 minutes).\n\nThis schedule meets all minimum time requirements and minimizes waiting time by starting with Joseph, who has a long availability window, followed by Barbara and Kevin during their overlapping availability, and ending with Jeffrey at his start time. The day is specified as \"1\" for simplicity.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:24 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:54 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:05 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:20 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:37 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:07 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:30 PM\"}]}"
