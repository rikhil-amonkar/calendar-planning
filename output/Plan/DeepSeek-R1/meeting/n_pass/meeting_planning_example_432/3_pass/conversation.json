The optimal schedule that allows you to meet Joseph, Barbara, Kevin, and Jeffrey while respecting travel times and availability constraints is as follows:\n\n- Start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (24 minutes), arriving at 9:24 AM.

Meet Jeffrey from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM (60 minutes).\n\nThis schedule meets all minimum time requirements and minimizes waiting time by starting with Joseph, who has a long availability window, followed by Barbara and Kevin during their overlapping availability, and ending with Jeffrey at his start time.
