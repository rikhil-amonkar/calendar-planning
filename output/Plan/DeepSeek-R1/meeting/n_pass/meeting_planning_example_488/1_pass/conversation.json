        "content": "SOLUTION: The optimal schedule allows meeting four friends (Ronald, Margaret, Helen, and Joshua) while satisfying all minimum time constraints. Meeting Sarah is impossible due to insufficient overlap between her availability (ending at 9:30 AM) and the earliest arrival time at Russian Hill (9:07 AM), leaving only 23 minutes for a meeting, which is less than the required 45 minutes. The schedule minimizes waiting time by starting with Ronald at Nob Hill, followed by Margaret at Haight-Ashbury, Helen at The Castro, and Joshua at Sunset District. Travel times are accounted for between meetings.\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Ronald\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Margaret\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:58AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:58PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:30PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"3:30PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"3:47PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"5:17PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
