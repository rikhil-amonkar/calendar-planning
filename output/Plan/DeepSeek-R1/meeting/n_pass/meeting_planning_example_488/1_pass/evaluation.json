    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: Sarah cannot be met because I arrive at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM, and with a 7-minute travel time to Russian Hill, I would arrive at 9:07 AM. However, Sarah is only available until 9:30 AM, leaving only 23 minutes for a meeting, which is less than the required 45 minutes. Therefore, it is impossible to meet Sarah. I can meet the other four friends: Ronald, Margaret, Helen, and Joshua. The optimal schedule that meets all minimum duration constraints and accounts for travel times is as follows:\n\n- Start at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Nob Hill (8 minutes), arriving at 9:08 AM. Wait until Ronald is available at 10:00 AM.\n- Meet Ronald at Nob Hill from 10:00 AM to 11:45 AM (105 minutes).\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury (13 minutes), arriving at 11:58 AM.\n- Meet Margaret at Haight-Ashbury from 11:58 AM to 12:58 PM (60 minutes).\n- Travel to The Castro (6 minutes), arriving at 1:04 PM. Wait until Helen is available at 1:30 PM.\n- Meet Helen at The Castro from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM (120 minutes).\n- Travel to Sunset District (17 minutes), arriving at 3:47 PM.\n- Meet Joshua at Sunset District from 3:47 PM to 5:17 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThis schedule meets all minimum duration requirements for Ronald, Margaret, Helen, and Joshua, with travel times fully accounted for.\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:00AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:45AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:58AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:58PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:30PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"3:47PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:17PM\"}\n  ]\n}",
