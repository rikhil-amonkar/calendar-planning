    "execution_output": "After re-evaluating the constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule meets four friends (Ronald, Margaret, Helen, and Joshua) while respecting all minimum meeting durations and availability windows. Meeting Sarah is impossible due to the 9:00 AM arrival at Pacific Heights, leaving only 23 minutes available at Russian Hill before Sarah's 9:30 AM departure, which is less than the required 45 minutes.\n\nThe revised schedule accounts for all travel times and avoids any lateness to meetings:\n- **Ronald (Nob Hill)**: Met for exactly 105 minutes starting at 10:00 AM (earliest availability).\n- **Margaret (Haight-Ashbury)**: Met for exactly 60 minutes, scheduled immediately after Ronald.\n- **Helen (The Castro)**: Met for exactly 120 minutes starting at 1:30 PM (earliest availability).\n- **Joshua (Sunset District)**: Met for exactly 90 minutes, scheduled after Helen.\n\nTravel times are directly from the provided data (Nob Hill to Haight-Ashbury: 13 min, Haight-Ashbury to The Castro: 6 min, The Castro to Sunset District: 17 min). All meetings occur within the friends' availability windows, and no minimum times are violated.\n\nSOLUTION:  \n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:00AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:45AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:58AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:58PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:30PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"3:47PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:17PM\"}\n  ]\n}",
