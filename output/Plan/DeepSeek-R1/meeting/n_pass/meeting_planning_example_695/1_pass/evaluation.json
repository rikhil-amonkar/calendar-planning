    "execution_output": "After analyzing the constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule allows meeting four friends: Nancy, Karen, Carol, and Matthew. It is not possible to meet more than four friends while satisfying all minimum meeting time requirements due to overlapping time windows and travel time constraints. Specifically:\n\n- Meeting Carol for 120 minutes requires being at Union Square by 6:15 PM at the latest to end by 8:15 PM.\n- Meeting Karen at The Castro at 5:00 PM conflicts with ending a meeting with Matthew at Russian Hill by 5:00 PM to arrive on time, given the 21-minute travel time.\n- Jeffrey and Patricia both start at 8:00 PM, but after meeting Carol until 8:15 PM, there is insufficient time to meet either for their minimum durations due to travel times (e.g., arriving at Chinatown at 8:22 PM only allows 68 minutes with Patricia before 9:30 PM, less than the required 75 minutes).\n- Paul can be met earlier, but it conflicts with arriving at Karen or Carol on time.\n\nThe schedule below maximizes the number of meetings:\n- Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.\n- Meet Nancy at Presidio from 11:45 AM to 12:15 PM (30 minutes, satisfying the minimum).\n- Travel to The Castro (21 minutes), arriving at 5:00 PM to meet Karen from 5:00 PM to 5:45 PM (45 minutes, satisfying the minimum).\n- Travel to Union Square (19 minutes), arriving at 6:04 PM; wait until 6:15 PM to meet Carol from 6:15 PM to 8:15 PM (120 minutes, satisfying the minimum).\n- Travel to Russian Hill (13 minutes), arriving at 8:28 PM to meet Matthew from 8:28 PM to 9:43 PM (75 minutes, satisfying the minimum).\n\nThis schedule meets the minimum time requirements for Nancy, Karen, Carol, and Matthew, and accounts for all travel times.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:15PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:45PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:15PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"8:28PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:43PM\"}]}",
