    "execution_output": "After re-evaluating the constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule that meets the minimum time requirements for four friends (Nancy, Karen, Carol, and Matthew) without violating any constraints is as follows. The schedule accounts for travel times between locations and ensures all meetings occur within the friends' availability windows. Meeting five or more friends is not possible while satisfying all minimum time requirements due to overlapping windows and travel constraints.\n\n**Schedule Details:**\n- **Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.**\n- **Nancy (Presidio):** Meet from 11:45 AM to 12:15 PM (30 minutes, within 11:45 AM\u201310:00 PM window). Travel from Bayview to Presidio (31 minutes) requires departing Bayview at 11:14 AM to arrive by 11:45 AM.\n- **Karen (The Castro):** Meet from 5:00 PM to 5:45 PM (45 minutes, within 5:00 PM\u20137:00 PM window). Travel from Presidio to The Castro (21 minutes) requires departing Presidio at 4:39 PM to arrive by 5:00 PM (with 21 minutes travel; arrival at 5:00 PM after departing at 4:39 PM).\n- **Carol (Union Square):** Meet from 6:04 PM to 8:04 PM (120 minutes, within 6:00 PM\u20138:15 PM window). Travel from The Castro to Union Square (19 minutes) requires departing The Castro at 5:45 PM to arrive at 6:04 PM.\n- **Matthew (Russian Hill):** Meet from 8:17 PM to 9:32 PM (75 minutes, within 3:45 PM\u20139:45 PM window). Travel from Union Square to Russian Hill (13 minutes) requires departing Union Square at 8:04 PM to arrive at 8:17 PM.\n\nThis schedule meets all minimum time requirements and respects travel times. Paul, Patricia, and Jeffrey cannot be included without violating Carol's 120-minute minimum or other constraints.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:15PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"5:00PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"5:45PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"6:04PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"8:04PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"8:17PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"9:32PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
