    "execution_output": "After analyzing the constraints and travel times, it is not possible to meet all four friends (Sarah, Mary, Helen, and Thomas) while satisfying the minimum meeting durations due to conflicts between Sarah's and Thomas's schedules. Specifically, the travel time between Fisherman's Wharf (Sarah) and Bayview (Thomas) is 26 minutes, and their availability windows (Sarah: 2:45 PM to 5:30 PM, Thomas: 3:15 PM to 6:45 PM) do not allow meeting both with their minimum durations (105 minutes for Sarah, 120 minutes for Thomas) when accounting for travel.\n\nHowever, it is possible to meet three friends: Mary, Sarah, and Helen. The optimal schedule is as follows:\n\n- Start at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Richmond District to meet Mary. Mary is available from 1:00 PM to 7:15 PM, with a minimum of 75 minutes. Arrive at 1:00 PM and meet until 2:15 PM (75 minutes).\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Sarah. Travel time from Richmond District to Fisherman's Wharf is 18 minutes, so depart Richmond District at 2:15 PM and arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 2:33 PM. Sarah is available from 2:45 PM to 5:30 PM, so wait until 2:45 PM and meet until 4:30 PM (105 minutes).\n- After meeting Sarah, there is free time until Helen's meeting. Travel to Mission District for Helen. Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District is 22 minutes, so depart Fisherman's Wharf at 9:23 PM to arrive at Mission District by 9:45 PM.\n- Meet Helen from 9:45 PM to 10:15 PM (30 minutes), within her availability window (9:45 PM to 10:30 PM).\n\nThomas cannot be included in this schedule without violating the minimum duration constraints for Sarah or Thomas. Meeting Mary, Thomas, and Helen is also possible but results in more waiting time and finishes later, with no advantage over meeting Mary, Sarah, and Helen.\n\nThe itinerary in the required JSON format includes only the meeting actions.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:15\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sarah\", \"start_time\": \"14:45\", \"end_time\": \"16:30\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Helen\", \"start_time\": \"21:45\", \"end_time\": \"22:15\"}]}",
