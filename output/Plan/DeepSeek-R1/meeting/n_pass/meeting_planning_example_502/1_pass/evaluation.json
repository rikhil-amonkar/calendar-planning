    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo maximize the number of friends met, the optimal schedule involves meeting Rebecca first at Fisherman's Wharf, followed by Stephanie at Golden Gate Park, then Karen at Chinatown, Steven at North Beach, and finally Brian at Union Square. Joseph cannot be met due to insufficient time, as arriving at the Financial District at 9:00 AM and traveling to Pacific Heights takes 13 minutes, leaving only 17 minutes before Joseph's availability ends at 9:30 AM, which is less than the required 60 minutes. The schedule accounts for all travel times and adheres to the minimum meeting durations and availability constraints.  \n\nMeeting Schedule:  \n- **Rebecca at Fisherman's Wharf**: Start after arrival at 9:10 AM, meet until 10:35 AM (85 minutes, exceeding the 30-minute minimum).  \n- **Stephanie at Golden Gate Park**: Start at 11:00 AM (after travel and no wait), meet until 12:45 PM (105 minutes exactly).  \n- **Karen at Chinatown**: Start at 1:45 PM (after travel and wait), meet until 2:00 PM (15 minutes exactly).  \n- **Steven at North Beach**: Start at 2:30 PM (after travel and wait), meet until 4:30 PM (120 minutes exactly).  \n- **Brian at Union Square**: Start at 4:37 PM (after travel), meet until 5:07 PM (30 minutes exactly).  \n\nThis schedule meets all friends except Joseph, with total meeting time of 355 minutes and minimal waiting time where unavoidable.  \n\nJSON Output:  \n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:10\", \"end_time\": \"10:35\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:00\", \"end_time\": \"12:45\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"13:45\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:30\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"16:37\", \"end_time\": \"17:07\"}]}",
