    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints and the previous schedule, I identified that the main issue was the meeting with Brian. In the previous schedule, Brian's meeting started at 4:37 PM and ended at 5:07 PM, which is within his availability (3:00 PM to 5:15 PM). However, to ensure all constraints are strictly satisfied and to optimize the schedule, I've adjusted the order of meetings. The new schedule prioritizes Brian immediately after Stephanie to utilize the waiting time more efficiently, followed by Karen and Steven. This ensures all minimum meeting times are met without overlapping or exceeding availability windows.\n\n**Revised Schedule:**\n- **Rebecca (Fisherman's Wharf):** 9:10 AM - 10:35 AM (85 minutes, within 8:00 AM - 11:15 AM)\n- **Stephanie (Golden Gate Park):** 11:00 AM - 12:45 PM (105 minutes, within 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM)\n- **Brian (Union Square):** 3:00 PM - 3:30 PM (30 minutes, within 3:00 PM - 5:15 PM)\n- **Karen (Chinatown):** 3:37 PM - 3:52 PM (15 minutes, within 1:45 PM - 4:30 PM)\n- **Steven (North Beach):** 3:55 PM - 5:55 PM (120 minutes, within 2:30 PM - 8:45 PM)\n\n**Travel Validation:**\n- Financial District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10 min (9:00 AM \u2192 9:10 AM)\n- Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25 min (10:35 AM \u2192 11:00 AM)\n- Golden Gate Park to Union Square: 22 min (12:45 PM \u2192 1:07 PM, wait until 3:00 PM)\n- Union Square to Chinatown: 7 min (3:30 PM \u2192 3:37 PM)\n- Chinatown to North Beach: 3 min (3:52 PM \u2192 3:55 PM)\n\n**JSON Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:10\", \"end_time\": \"10:35\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:00\", \"end_time\": \"12:45\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:00\", \"end_time\": \"15:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:37\", \"end_time\": \"15:52\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:55\", \"end_time\": \"17:55\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
