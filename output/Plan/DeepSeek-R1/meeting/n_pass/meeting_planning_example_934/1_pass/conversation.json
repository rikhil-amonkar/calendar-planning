        "content": "SOLUTION: The optimal schedule meets 7 friends: Richard, Kenneth, Sarah, Karen, Daniel, Mark, and Joseph. This maximizes the number of friends met while respecting all minimum meeting times, availability constraints, and travel times. The schedule starts at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM, with the first meeting at Chinatown after a 6-minute travel time. Travel times between locations are accounted for in the gaps between meetings. Thomas, Mary, and David cannot be included without violating minimum meeting times or availability windows due to conflicts with Mark's 120-minute requirement and the simultaneous 8:00 PM start times of Mary, Joseph, and David.\n\n**Itinerary in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Richard\", \"start_time\": \"09:06\", \"end_time\": \"09:36\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sarah\", \"start_time\": \"12:04\", \"end_time\": \"13:34\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"13:47\", \"end_time\": \"15:47\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Daniel\", \"start_time\": \"15:54\", \"end_time\": \"16:09\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mark\", \"start_time\": \"17:30\", \"end_time\": \"19:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"22:00\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Schedule Details:**\n- **Richard (Chinatown):** Met from 9:06 AM to 9:36 AM (30 minutes, meeting minimum 30 minutes). Travel from Nob Hill (start at 9:00 AM) to Chinatown takes 6 minutes.\n- **Kenneth (The Castro):** Met from 11:15 AM to 11:45 AM (30 minutes, meeting minimum 30 minutes). Travel from Chinatown to The Castro takes 22 minutes (arrive at 9:58 AM, wait until 11:15 AM).\n- **Sarah (Union Square):** Met from 12:04 PM to 1:34 PM (90 minutes, meeting minimum 90 minutes). Travel from The Castro to Union Square takes 19 minutes.\n- **Karen (Russian Hill):** Met from 1:47 PM to 3:47 PM (120 minutes, meeting minimum 120 minutes). Travel from Union Square to Russian Hill takes 13 minutes.\n- **Daniel (Pacific Heights):** Met from 3:54 PM to 4:09 PM (15 minutes, meeting minimum 15 minutes). Travel from Russian Hill to Pacific Heights takes 7 minutes.\n- **Mark (Golden Gate Park):** Met from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM (120 minutes, meeting minimum 120 minutes). Travel from Pacific Heights to Golden Gate Park takes 15 minutes (arrive at 4:09 PM + travel, but Mark starts at 5:30 PM, so wait from 4:24 PM to 5:30 PM).\n- **Joseph (Haight-Ashbury):** Met from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM (120 minutes, meeting minimum 120 minutes). Travel from Golden Gate Park to Haight-Ashbury takes 7 minutes (arrive at 7:37 PM, wait until 8:00 PM).\n\n**Friends Not Met:**\n- **Thomas:** Cannot be met due to conflict with Mark's meeting and travel time; arriving at North Beach by 7:15 PM would require leaving Golden Gate Park by 6:52 PM, reducing Mark's meeting below 120 minutes.\n- **Mary and David:** Cannot be met simultaneously with Joseph due to 8:00 PM start time conflicts and insufficient time for travel and minimum meetings. Meeting Joseph maximizes time with one friend."
