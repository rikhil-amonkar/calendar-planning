    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nTo maximize the number of friends met, the optimal schedule involves meeting Richard, Sarah, Karen, Daniel, Kenneth, Mark, and Joseph. This schedule accounts for travel times, minimum meeting durations, and availability constraints, resulting in 7 meetings. Thomas, Mary, and David cannot be met due to conflicts with travel times and overlapping evening windows.\n\n- Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Meet Richard at Chinatown from 9:06 AM to 9:36 AM (30 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Union Square (7 minutes), arriving at 11:45 AM to meet Sarah from 11:45 AM to 1:15 PM (90 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Russian Hill (13 minutes), arriving at 1:28 PM to meet Karen from 1:28 PM to 3:28 PM (120 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Pacific Heights (7 minutes), arriving at 3:35 PM to meet Daniel from 3:35 PM to 3:50 PM (15 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to The Castro (16 minutes), arriving at 4:06 PM to meet Kenneth from 4:06 PM to 4:36 PM (30 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park (11 minutes), arriving at 4:47 PM; wait until 5:30 PM to meet Mark from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM (120 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury (7 minutes), arriving at 7:37 PM; wait until 8:00 PM to meet Joseph from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM (120 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n\nThis schedule meets 7 friends. Thomas (North Beach, 7:15 PM to 7:45 PM) cannot be met because travel from Golden Gate Park would arrive after 7:45 PM. Mary (Embarcadero, 8:00 PM to 9:15 PM) and David (Marina District, 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM) conflict with Joseph's meeting and cannot be accommodated.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:06 AM\", \"end_time\": \"9:36 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45 AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:15 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:28 PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:28 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"3:35 PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:50 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:06 PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:36 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:30 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"8:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"10:00 PM\"}]}",
