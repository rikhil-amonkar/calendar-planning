    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nAfter evaluating various schedules to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints (minimum meeting durations, availability windows, and travel times), the optimal schedule meets 8 friends: William, Kimberly, David, Joshua, George, Ronald, Charles, and Kenneth. Patricia and Mary could not be included without violating minimum meeting times due to travel time conflicts. The schedule ensures all meetings start and end within the friends' availability windows, with travel times accounted for between locations. The meeting times are as follows in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:14 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:14 AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:33 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:18 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:34 PM\", \"end_time\": \"12:49 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:00 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:21 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:06 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:28 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:58 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:17 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:32 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:30 PM\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n### Explanation of the Schedule:\n- **William at Presidio (9:14 AM to 10:14 AM)**: Start after 14 min travel from Russian Hill (arrive 9:14 AM); 60 min meeting meets minimum.\n- **Kimberly at Alamo Square (10:33 AM to 12:18 PM)**: 19 min travel from Presidio (arrive 10:33 AM); 105 min meeting meets minimum.\n- **David at Sunset District (12:34 PM to 12:49 PM)**: 16 min travel from Alamo Square (arrive 12:34 PM); 15 min meeting meets minimum. David is available all day, so this fits the gap.\n- **Joshua at Financial District (2:30 PM to 4:00 PM)**: 30 min travel from Sunset District (arrive 1:19 PM), wait until 2:30 PM; 90 min meeting meets minimum within availability.\n- **George at The Castro (4:21 PM to 6:06 PM)**: 21 min travel from Financial District (arrive 4:21 PM); 105 min meeting meets minimum within availability.\n- **Ronald at Embarcadero (6:28 PM to 6:58 PM)**: 22 min travel from The Castro (arrive 6:28 PM); 30 min meeting meets minimum within availability.\n- **Charles at Richmond District (7:17 PM to 7:32 PM)**: 19 min travel from Embarcadero (arrive 7:17 PM); 15 min meeting meets minimum within availability.\n- **Kenneth at Union Square (9:15 PM to 9:30 PM)**: 21 min travel from Richmond District (leave 8:54 PM, arrive 9:15 PM); 15 min meeting meets minimum within availability.\n\n### Why Patricia and Mary Could Not Be Included:\n- **Patricia (Nob Hill, 3:00 PM to 7:15 PM, min 120 min)**: Attempts to schedule conflicted with Joshua and George due to travel times. For example, after Joshua (end 4:00 PM), travel to Nob Hill takes 8 min (arrive 4:08 PM), but meeting until 6:08 PM would conflict with George's start (needed by 4:21 PM at The Castro). Meeting Patricia after George (end 6:06 PM) allows only 53 min by 7:15 PM, insufficient for 120 min.\n- **Mary (Marina District, 2:45 PM to 4:45 PM, min 45 min)**: Scheduling conflicted with Joshua. Meeting Mary at 2:45 PM (after 15 min travel from Alamo Square) until 3:30 PM, then traveling to Financial District (17 min) for Joshua at 3:47 PM, allows only 88 min by 5:15 PM (insufficient for 90 min). Meeting Joshua first (end 4:00 PM) and then Mary (arrive 4:15 PM) allows only 30 min by 4:45 PM, insufficient for 45 min.\n\nThis schedule optimizes the number of meetings (8) while adhering to all constraints.",
