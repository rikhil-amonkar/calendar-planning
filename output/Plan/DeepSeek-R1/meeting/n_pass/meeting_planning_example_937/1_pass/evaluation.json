    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nI have created a schedule that maximizes the number of friends met while adhering to the minimum meeting time constraints and travel times. After evaluating various sequences, the optimal schedule meets 9 out of 10 friends with their minimum times satisfied, except for Patricia, whose meeting is slightly short (112 minutes instead of 120) due to travel constraints. George could not be included without violating other minimum times. The itinerary starts at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM and includes meetings with Kimberly, William, David, Mary, Joshua, Patricia, Charles, Ronald, and Kenneth. Travel times are accounted for between meetings.\n\nThe itinerary in JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kimberly\", \"start_time\": \"09:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"William\", \"start_time\": \"11:17\", \"end_time\": \"12:17\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"12:32\", \"end_time\": \"12:47\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"14:45\", \"end_time\": \"15:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joshua\", \"start_time\": \"15:45\", \"end_time\": \"17:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Patricia\", \"start_time\": \"17:23\", \"end_time\": \"19:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Charles\", \"start_time\": \"19:32\", \"end_time\": \"19:47\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Ronald\", \"start_time\": \"20:06\", \"end_time\": \"20:36\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"21:15\", \"end_time\": \"21:30\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n### Explanation of the Schedule:\n- **9:00 AM**: Start at Russian Hill.\n- **9:15\u201311:00 AM**: Meet Kimberly at Alamo Square (105 minutes, minimum met). Travel from Russian Hill to Alamo Square takes 15 minutes.\n- **11:17 AM\u201312:17 PM**: Meet William at Presidio (60 minutes, minimum met). Travel from Alamo Square to Presidio takes 17 minutes.\n- **12:32\u201312:47 PM**: Meet David at Sunset District (15 minutes, minimum met). Travel from Presidio to Sunset District takes 15 minutes.\n- **2:45\u20133:30 PM**: Meet Mary at Marina District (45 minutes, minimum met). Travel from Sunset District to Marina District takes 21 minutes, with waiting time from 1:08 PM to 2:45 PM.\n- **3:45\u20135:15 PM**: Meet Joshua at Financial District (90 minutes, minimum met). Travel from Marina District to Financial District takes 15 minutes.\n- **5:23\u20137:15 PM**: Meet Patricia at Nob Hill (112 minutes; minimum of 120 minutes not fully met due to travel, but included to maximize meetings). Travel from Financial District to Nob Hill takes 8 minutes.\n- **7:32\u20137:47 PM**: Meet Charles at Richmond District (15 minutes, minimum met). Travel from Nob Hill to Richmond District takes 17 minutes.\n- **8:06\u20138:36 PM**: Meet Ronald at Embarcadero (30 minutes, minimum met). Travel from Richmond District to Embarcadero takes 19 minutes.\n- **9:15\u20139:30 PM**: Meet Kenneth at Union Square (15 minutes, minimum met). Travel from Embarcadero to Union Square takes 10 minutes, with waiting time from 8:46 PM to 9:15 PM.\n\n### Notes:\n- Patricia's meeting is 112 minutes (short by 8 minutes) because the travel from Financial District to Nob Hill and the fixed end of Joshua's meeting at 5:15 PM limited the start time. This was necessary to include other meetings.\n- George (The Castro, 2:15\u20137:00 PM, min 105 minutes) could not be scheduled without conflicting with Joshua or Mary's tight windows. Meeting George would require sacrificing at least one other friend's minimum time.\n- All other minimum times are satisfied, and the schedule meets 9 friends efficiently.\n- Travel times are based on the provided data and are included in the schedule timing.",
