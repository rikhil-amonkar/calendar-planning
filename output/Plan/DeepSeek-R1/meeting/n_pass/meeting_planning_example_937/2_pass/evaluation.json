    "execution_output": "After reevaluating the schedule to address the constraints, the optimal solution now meets 9 friends: William, Kimberly, David, Joshua, Mary, George, Ronald, Charles, and Kenneth. Patricia could not be included due to travel time conflicts and availability window limitations. The revised schedule ensures all meetings start and end within the friends' availability windows, with travel times properly accounted for between locations. The meeting times are as follows in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:14 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:14 AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:33 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:18 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:34 PM\", \"end_time\": \"12:49 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:19 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:49 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"3:06 PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:51 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:30 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:30 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:49 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:04 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:15 PM\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Revised Schedule:\n- **William at Presidio (9:14 AM to 10:14 AM)**: Start after 14 min travel from Russian Hill; 60 min meeting meets minimum requirement.\n- **Kimberly at Alamo Square (10:33 AM to 12:18 PM)**: 19 min travel from Presidio; 105 min meeting meets minimum requirement.\n- **David at Sunset District (12:34 PM to 12:49 PM)**: 16 min travel from Alamo Square; 15 min meeting meets minimum requirement.\n- **Joshua at Financial District (1:19 PM to 2:49 PM)**: 30 min travel from Sunset District; 90 min meeting within availability (1:00 PM to 5:15 PM).\n- **Mary at Marina District (3:06 PM to 3:51 PM)**: 17 min travel from Financial District; 45 min meeting within availability (2:45 PM to 4:45 PM).\n- **George at The Castro (4:00 PM to 5:30 PM)**: 9 min travel from Marina District; 90 min meeting within availability (4:00 PM to 8:00 PM).\n- **Ronald at Embarcadero (6:00 PM to 6:30 PM)**: 22 min travel from The Castro (arrive 5:52 PM), wait until availability starts; 30 min meeting within window (6:00 PM to 8:00 PM).\n- **Charles at Richmond District (6:49 PM to 7:04 PM)**: 19 min travel from Embarcadero; 15 min meeting within availability (6:00 PM to 8:00 PM).\n- **Kenneth at Union Square (9:00 PM to 9:15 PM)**: 21 min travel from Richmond District (leave 8:39 PM); 15 min meeting within availability (9:00 PM to 10:00 PM).\n\n### Why Patricia Could Not Be Included:\n- **Patricia (Nob Hill, 3:00 PM to 7:15 PM, min 120 min)**: Attempts to schedule conflicted with existing meetings. For example:\n  - After Joshua (ends 2:49 PM), travel to Nob Hill takes 8 min (arrive 2:57 PM). Meeting until 4:57 PM would conflict with George's start (need to arrive at The Castro by 4:00 PM).\n  - After George (ends 5:30 PM), travel to Nob Hill takes 15 min (arrive 5:45 PM). Only 90 min available until 7:15 PM, insufficient for 120 min meeting.\n  - After Charles (ends 7:04 PM), travel to Nob Hill takes 15 min (arrive 7:19 PM), exceeding Patricia's 7:15 PM availability end.\n\nThis revised schedule maximizes the number of meetings (9) while adhering to all constraints, including travel times, minimum meeting durations, and availability windows.",
