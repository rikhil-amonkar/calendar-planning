    "execution_output": "After reevaluating the constraints, I realize the previous schedule unnecessarily delayed Rebecca's meeting, causing a long idle period at Bayview. The optimal solution is to start with Rebecca as early as possible, then proceed sequentially while respecting all availability windows and travel times. The unavoidable idle time before Amanda's meeting is minimized by scheduling earlier meetings efficiently.\n\n**Revised Schedule:**\n1. **Rebecca at Bayview (9:19 AM - 10:49 AM)**  \n   - Depart Castro at 9:00 AM (19 min travel), arrive 9:19 AM  \n   - 90-min meeting within availability (9:00 AM - 12:45 PM)  \n   \n2. **James at Alamo Square (11:05 AM - 12:35 PM)**  \n   - Depart Bayview at 10:49 AM (16 min travel), arrive 11:05 AM  \n   - 90-min meeting within availability (9:45 AM - 9:15 PM)  \n   \n3. **Melissa at Golden Gate Park (12:44 PM - 2:14 PM)**  \n   - Depart Alamo Square at 12:35 PM (9 min travel), arrive 12:44 PM  \n   - 90-min meeting within availability (9:00 AM - 6:45 PM)  \n   \n4. **Sarah at Fisherman's Wharf (2:38 PM - 4:08 PM)**  \n   - Depart Golden Gate Park at 2:14 PM (24 min travel), arrive 2:38 PM  \n   - 90-min meeting within availability (8:00 AM - 9:30 PM)  \n   \n5. **Amanda at Pacific Heights (6:30 PM - 8:00 PM)**  \n   - Depart Fisherman's Wharf at 4:08 PM (12 min travel), arrive 4:20 PM  \n   - Wait until availability starts at 6:30 PM (idle time: 2h10m)  \n   - 90-min meeting within availability (6:30 PM - 9:45 PM)  \n\n**Verification:**\n- All meetings meet/exceed 90 minutes\n- All start times fall within friends' availability windows\n- Travel times match the provided table\n- Idle time before Amanda is unavoidable due to her 6:30 PM start time\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:19 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:49 AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"11:05 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:35 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"12:44 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:14 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"2:38 PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:08 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"6:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:00 PM\"}\n  ]\n}",
