    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nThe optimal schedule allows you to meet all five friends while respecting the minimum meeting time of 90 minutes for each and accounting for travel times. The schedule starts at The Castro at 9:00 AM and proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Meet Rebecca at Bayview from 9:19 AM to 10:49 AM (arrive at 9:19 AM after 19-minute travel from The Castro).\n2. Meet James at Alamo Square from 11:05 AM to 12:35 PM (arrive at 11:05 AM after 16-minute travel from Bayview).\n3. Meet Melissa at Golden Gate Park from 12:44 PM to 2:14 PM (arrive at 12:44 PM after 9-minute travel from Alamo Square).\n4. Meet Sarah at Fisherman's Wharf from 2:38 PM to 4:08 PM (arrive at 2:38 PM after 24-minute travel from Golden Gate Park).\n5. Meet Amanda at Pacific Heights from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM (arrive at 4:20 PM after 12-minute travel from Fisherman's Wharf, then wait until Amanda's availability starts at 6:30 PM).\n\nThis schedule ensures all meetings are within the friends' availability windows and meets the minimum duration requirement. The idle time before meeting Amanda is acceptable as it does not prevent meeting all friends.\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:19 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:49 AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"11:05 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:35 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"12:44 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:14 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"2:38 PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:08 PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"6:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:00 PM\"}\n  ]\n}",
