Arrive at Presidio at 9:11 AM, wait until Jason is available at 10:00 AM, and meet for 90 minutes until 11:30 AM. Then travel to Marina District, arriving at 11:40 AM, and wait until Kenneth is available at 3:30 PM. Meet Kenneth for 45 minutes until 4:15 PM. This schedule meets both friends for the minimum required times, with unavoidable idle time due to the constraints.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jason\", \"start_time\": \"10:00AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:30AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"3:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:15PM\"}]}",
