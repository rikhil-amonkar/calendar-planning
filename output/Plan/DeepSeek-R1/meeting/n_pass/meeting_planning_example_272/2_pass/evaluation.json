After reevaluating all constraints and travel times, the optimized schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met without overlaps or travel conflicts.\n\n**Revised Schedule:**\n- Start at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Embarcadero (8 minutes), arriving at 9:08 AM. Wait until Timothy's availability begins.\n- Meet Timothy at Embarcadero from 9:45 AM to 11:45 AM (120 minutes, minimum met).\n- Stay at Embarcadero until departure time to avoid unnecessary travel.\n- Travel to Nob Hill (10 minutes), departing Embarcadero at 6:20 PM to arrive at 6:30 PM.\n- Meet Patricia at Nob Hill from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM (90 minutes, minimum met).\n- Travel to Mission District (13 minutes), departing Nob Hill at 8:00 PM to arrive at 8:13 PM. Wait until Ashley's availability begins.\n- Meet Ashley at Mission District from 8:30 PM to 9:15 PM (45 minutes, minimum met).\n\nThis schedule adheres to all constraints:\n- Patricia: 90 minutes within 6:30 PM\u20139:45 PM.\n- Ashley: 45 minutes within 8:30 PM\u20139:15 PM.\n- Timothy: 120 minutes within 9:45 AM\u20135:45 PM.\n- Travel times are fully accounted for between meetings.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:45AM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"6:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:00PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"8:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:15PM\"}]}",
