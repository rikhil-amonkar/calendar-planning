    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nI have considered various schedules to meet all three friends while respecting the time constraints and travel times. The optimal schedule involves meeting Timothy first in the morning at Embarcadero, then meeting Patricia at Nob Hill in the evening with a start time adjusted to minimize waiting for Ashley, and finally meeting Ashley at Mission District exactly during her availability window. Travel times are accounted for between meetings, but only the meeting actions are included in the itinerary as per the required JSON format.\n\n- Start at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Embarcadero (8 minutes) to meet Timothy from 9:45 AM to 11:45 AM (120 minutes, within his 9:45 AM to 5:45 PM window).\n- Remain at Embarcadero or free time until 5:45 PM.\n- Travel to Nob Hill (10 minutes), arriving at 5:55 PM.\n- Meet Patricia from 6:47 PM to 8:17 PM (90 minutes, starting after her 6:30 PM availability and ending before her 9:45 PM end time, with travel to Mission District considered).\n- Travel to Mission District (13 minutes), arriving at 8:30 PM.\n- Meet Ashley from 8:30 PM to 9:15 PM (45 minutes, exactly within her 8:30 PM to 9:15 PM window).\n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met with minimal waiting, and all friends are visited.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Timothy\", \"start_time\": \"9:45 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:45 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Patricia\", \"start_time\": \"6:47 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:17 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Ashley\", \"start_time\": \"8:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:15 PM\"}]}",
