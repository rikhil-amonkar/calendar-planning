Starting at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM, I travel to Embarcadero to meet Timothy first, as his availability is during the day. I then travel to Nob Hill to meet Patricia in the evening, ensuring I end in time to travel to Mission District to meet Ashley within her short availability window.\n\n- **Timothy meeting**: At Embarcadero from 9:45 AM to 11:45 AM (120 minutes, satisfying the minimum). I depart Russian Hill at 9:37 AM (8 min travel) to arrive exactly at 9:45 AM.\n- **Patricia meeting**: At Nob Hill from 6:30 PM to 8:17 PM (107 minutes, exceeding the 90-minute minimum). I depart Embarcadero at 5:45 PM (10 min travel) to arrive at Nob Hill by 5:55 PM, waiting until Patricia arrives at 6:30 PM. I end at 8:17 PM to allow for travel to Mission District.\n- **Ashley meeting**: At Mission District from 8:30 PM to 9:15 PM (45 minutes, satisfying the minimum). I depart Nob Hill at 8:17 PM (13 min travel) to arrive at Mission District by 8:30 PM.\n\nThis schedule meets all friends with the required minimum times, and travel times are accounted for between meetings.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:45AM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"6:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:17PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"8:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:15PM\"}]}",
