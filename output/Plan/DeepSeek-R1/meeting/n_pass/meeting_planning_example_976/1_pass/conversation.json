        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nAfter evaluating the constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule maximizes the number of friends met while respecting the minimum meeting times. Stephanie is skipped because it is impossible to meet the 60-minute minimum due to arrival constraints (only 55 minutes available). The schedule starts at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM and efficiently sequences meetings to minimize waiting time and travel conflicts. The following itinerary meets 6 friends with all minimum times satisfied:\n\n- Brian at Marina District from 12:15 PM to 1:15 PM (60 minutes, within 12:15 PM to 6:00 PM).\n- Thomas at Fisherman's Wharf from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM (30 minutes, within 1:30 PM to 7:00 PM).\n- Nancy at North Beach from 2:45 PM to 3:00 PM (15 minutes, within 2:45 PM to 8:00 PM).\n- Charles at The Castro from 4:30 PM to 6:15 PM (105 minutes, within 4:30 PM to 10:00 PM).\n- Mary at Union Square from 6:34 PM to 7:34 PM (60 minutes, within 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM).\n- Sarah at Alamo Square from 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM (105 minutes, within 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM).\n\nJessica, Karen, and Matthew cannot be included without violating minimum times or overlapping constraints. Travel times are accounted for in the schedule but not included in the JSON output as only meetings are listed.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"12:15\", \"end_time\": \"13:15\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Thomas\", \"start_time\": \"13:30\", \"end_time\": \"14:00\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Nancy\", \"start_time\": \"14:45\", \"end_time\": \"15:00\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Charles\", \"start_time\": \"16:30\", \"end_time\": \"18:15\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"18:34\", \"end_time\": \"19:34\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sarah\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"21:45\"}]}"
