    "execution_output": "After analyzing the travel times and availability constraints, the optimal schedule maximizes the number of friends met while adhering to the minimum meeting times where possible. However, due to conflicts in timing and travel constraints, it is not feasible to meet all friends for their full minimum durations. Specifically:\n\n- Stephanie can be met for 55 minutes (slightly less than the desired 60 minutes) due to the late arrival at Presidio.\n- Karen and Matthew cannot be met for their minimum times without conflicting with Sarah's tight window (which must be fully utilized for the minimum 105 minutes).\n- Charles is not included in the schedule as meeting him would conflict with Sarah or result in insufficient meeting time.\n- All other friends (Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, and Sarah) are met for at least their minimum times.\n\nThe best schedule involves meeting 7 friends, with Stephanie met for 55 minutes (close to the minimum), and the others meeting or exceeding their minimum times. The schedule is as follows, starting from Embarcadero at 9:00 AM:\n\n1. **Stephanie at Presidio**: Depart Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, travel 20 minutes, arrive at 9:20 AM. Meet from 9:20 AM to 10:15 AM (55 minutes).\n2. **Brian at Marina District**: Depart Presidio at 10:15 AM, travel 11 minutes, arrive at 12:15 PM (after waiting). Meet from 12:15 PM to 1:15 PM (60 minutes).\n3. **Thomas at Fisherman's Wharf**: Depart Marina District at 1:15 PM, travel 10 minutes, arrive at 1:30 PM (timed to start). Meet from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM (30 minutes).\n4. **Nancy at North Beach**: Depart Fisherman's Wharf at 2:30 PM, travel 6 minutes, arrive at 2:45 PM (timed to start). Meet from 2:45 PM to 3:00 PM (15 minutes).\n5. **Jessica at Nob Hill**: Depart North Beach at 3:00 PM, travel 7 minutes, arrive at 3:07 PM. Wait until availability starts at 4:30 PM. Meet from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM (120 minutes).\n6. **Mary at Union Square**: Depart Nob Hill at 6:30 PM, travel 7 minutes, arrive at 6:37 PM. Meet from 6:37 PM to 7:37 PM (60 minutes).\n7. **Sarah at Alamo Square**: Depart Union Square at 7:37 PM, travel 15 minutes, arrive at 7:52 PM. Wait until availability starts at 8:00 PM. Meet from 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM (105 minutes).\n\nThis schedule ensures that Sarah's exact window is met, and all other meetings (except Stephanie) achieve the minimum times. Karen and Matthew are omitted as meeting them would require sacrificing Sarah's minimum time or result in insufficient duration. Charles is omitted due to timing conflicts with the evening schedule.\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:20 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:15 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:15 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:00 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:00 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:30 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:37 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:37 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"8:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:45 PM\"}]}",
