        "content": "SOLUTION:\nThe optimal schedule allows meeting 8 friends: Sandra, William, Joseph, Carol, Anthony, Stephanie, Barbara, and Kenneth. It is not possible to meet Elizabeth due to a conflict with Joseph's fixed meeting window and Elizabeth's minimum meeting time requirement of 105 minutes, which cannot be satisfied while accommodating Joseph's exact 12:45 PM to 2:00 PM slot. The schedule maximizes the number of meetings by starting early, minimizing travel time between locations, and adhering to all constraints.\n\nThe itinerary in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"William\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:11\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:11\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Anthony\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:34\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:49\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:56\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:11\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
