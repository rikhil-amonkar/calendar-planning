This schedule maximizes the number of meetings while respecting all minimum meeting times, travel times, and availability constraints. Steven and Elizabeth cannot be met due to conflicts with the min meeting times and travel constraints in the evening.  \n\nThe schedule is as follows:  \n- Start at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM.  \n- Meet Matthew at Marina District from 9:15 AM to 10:00 AM (45 min, min met).  \n- Meet Helen at Golden Gate Park from 10:18 AM to 11:03 AM (45 min, min met).  \n- Meet Deborah at Bayview from 11:26 AM to 11:56 AM (30 min, min met).  \n- Meet Rebecca at Financial District from 2:45 PM to 3:15 PM (30 min, min met).  \n- Meet Joseph at Union Square from 3:24 PM to 5:24 PM (120 min, min met).  \n- Meet Ronald at Sunset District from 5:51 PM to 6:51 PM (60 min, min met).  \n- Meet Robert at Alamo Square from 7:08 PM to 9:08 PM (120 min, min met).  \n\nTravel times are accounted for between meetings.
