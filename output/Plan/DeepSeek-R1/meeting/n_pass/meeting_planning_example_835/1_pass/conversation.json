The itinerary starts at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM, and after accounting for travel times, the meetings are scheduled as follows:\n\n- Meet Matthew at Marina District from 9:15 AM to 10:00 AM (45 minutes, meeting the minimum duration).\n- Meet Helen at Golden Gate Park from 10:18 AM to 11:03 AM (45 minutes, meeting the minimum duration).\n- Meet Deborah at Bayview from 11:26 AM to 11:56 AM (30 minutes, meeting the minimum duration).\n- Meet Rebecca at Financial District from 2:45 PM to 3:15 PM (30 minutes, meeting the minimum duration during her availability).\n- Meet Joseph at Union Square from 3:24 PM to 5:24 PM (120 minutes, meeting the minimum duration).\n- Meet Ronald at Sunset District from 5:51 PM to 6:51 PM (60 minutes, meeting the minimum duration).\n- Meet Robert at Alamo Square from 7:08 PM to 9:08 PM (120 minutes, meeting the minimum duration within his availability).\n\nSteven and Elizabeth cannot be met without violating minimum duration requirements due to time conflicts with Robert and travel constraints. The schedule efficiently uses available time, with travel periods between meetings (e.g., 12:15 PM to 2:45 PM waiting for Rebecca) not included in the itinerary as only \"meet\" actions are listed.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Matthew\", \"start_time\": \"09:15 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:00 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Helen\", \"start_time\": \"10:18 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:03 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Deborah\", \"start_time\": \"11:26 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:56 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Rebecca\", \"start_time\": \"02:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"03:15 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"03:24 PM\", \"end_time\": \"05:24 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Ronald\", \"start_time\": \"05:51 PM\", \"end_time\": \"06:51 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"07:08 PM\", \"end_time\": \"09:08 PM\"}]}"
