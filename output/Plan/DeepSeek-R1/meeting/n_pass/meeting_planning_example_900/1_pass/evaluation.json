    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nAfter considering the constraints, travel times, and minimum meeting durations, the optimal schedule allows meeting 7 friends while satisfying all minimum time requirements. The friends met are Emily, Karen, Stephanie, Steven, Elizabeth, Brian, and William. Matthew, Rebecca, and James cannot be met without violating constraints or minimum times.  \n\nThe schedule is as follows:  \n- Start at Richmond District at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel to Pacific Heights to meet Emily from 11:15 AM to 11:30 AM (15 minutes, minimum met).  \n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury to meet Karen from 11:45 AM to 12:15 PM (30 minutes, minimum met; includes waiting time from 11:41 AM arrival to 11:45 AM start).  \n- Travel to Mission District to meet Stephanie from 1:00 PM to 2:15 PM (75 minutes, minimum met; includes waiting time from 12:26 PM arrival to 1:00 PM start).  \n- Travel to Russian Hill to meet Steven from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM (30 minutes, minimum met).  \n- Travel to Alamo Square to meet Elizabeth from 3:15 PM to 5:15 PM (120 minutes, minimum met).  \n- Travel to Marina District to meet Brian from 5:30 PM to 6:00 PM (30 minutes, minimum met).  \n- Travel to Bayview to meet William from 6:27 PM to 8:00 PM (93 minutes, exceeds minimum of 90 minutes; ends at 8:00 PM to account for travel, but William available until 8:15 PM).  \n\nTravel times are accounted for between meetings:  \n- Richmond to Pacific Heights: 10 minutes (depart 11:05 AM, arrive 11:15 AM).  \n- Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury: 11 minutes (depart 11:30 AM, arrive 11:41 AM).  \n- Haight-Ashbury to Mission District: 11 minutes (depart 12:15 PM, arrive 12:26 PM).  \n- Mission District to Russian Hill: 15 minutes (depart 2:15 PM, arrive 2:30 PM).  \n- Russian Hill to Alamo Square: 15 minutes (depart 3:00 PM, arrive 3:15 PM).  \n- Alamo Square to Marina District: 15 minutes (depart 5:15 PM, arrive 5:30 PM).  \n- Marina District to Bayview: 27 minutes (depart 6:00 PM, arrive 6:27 PM).  \n\nMatthew (The Castro), Rebecca (Nob Hill), and James (Chinatown) cannot be met due to conflicts with travel times and minimum durations, particularly with the overlapping long meetings for Elizabeth, Rebecca, and James, which cannot be resolved without sacrificing minimum times or other meetings.\n\nOutput in JSON format:\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:30\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"12:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:30\", \"end_time\": \"15:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"15:15\", \"end_time\": \"17:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:30\", \"end_time\": \"18:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:27\", \"end_time\": \"20:00\"}\n  ]\n}",
