        "content": "SOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule allows meeting 6 friends: Joshua, David, Stephanie, Laura, Kimberly, and Lisa. Ronald is impossible to meet due to insufficient time after accounting for travel. Helen and Elizabeth conflict with other meetings and cannot be included without reducing the total number. Timothy cannot be met due to insufficient time after Elizabeth's meeting. The schedule maximizes the number of meetings by grouping geographically proximate locations and minimizing waiting times.  \n\nTravel times are accounted for between meetings, but only the meeting actions are listed in the itinerary.  \n\n**Meeting Schedule in JSON Format:**  \n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:20 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:05 AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:25 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:55 AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"04:00 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"04:30 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"05:45 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"07:15 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"07:30 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"08:45 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Lisa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"08:52 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:37 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
