        "content": "SOLUTION: After evaluating various schedules to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints (availability windows, minimum meeting times, and travel times), the optimal schedule allows meeting 6 friends: Joshua, David, Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, and Laura. Ronald cannot be met due to insufficient time (arrival at Castro at 9:00 AM allows only 30 minutes with Ronald, less than the 90-minute minimum). Helen conflicts with Kimberly and Laura due to travel times and overlapping windows. Elizabeth and Timothy conflict with the west group meetings (Kimberly, Lisa, Laura) and cannot be included without sacrificing others.\n\nThe schedule is as follows:\n- Start at Castro at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Presidio (20 min) to meet Joshua from 9:20 AM to 11:05 AM (105 min).\n- Travel to Embarcadero (20 min) to meet David from 11:25 AM to 11:55 AM (30 min).\n- Free time from 11:55 AM to 3:30 PM (used for travel/waiting; no meetings possible).\n- Travel to Alamo Square (19 min from Embarcadero) to meet Stephanie from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM (30 min).\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury (5 min) to meet Kimberly from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM (75 min; wait from 4:05 PM to 4:45 PM).\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park (7 min) to meet Lisa from 6:07 PM to 6:52 PM (45 min).\n- Travel to Sunset District (10 min) to meet Laura from 7:02 PM to 8:32 PM (90 min).\n\nThis schedule meets all minimum time requirements and accounts for travel times between districts.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:20 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:05 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:25 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:55 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"03:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"04:00 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"04:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"06:00 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"06:07 PM\", \"end_time\": \"06:52 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"07:02 PM\", \"end_time\": \"08:32 PM\"}]}"
