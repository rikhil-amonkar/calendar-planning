    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nI have optimized the schedule to meet all four friends while respecting the travel times and meeting duration constraints. The schedule is as follows:\n\n- Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Alamo Square (17 minutes) to meet Kevin first, as this minimizes total travel time compared to other sequences.\n- Meet Kevin from 9:17 AM to 10:32 AM (75 minutes).\n- Travel to Russian Hill (13 minutes) to meet Kimberly.\n- Meet Kimberly from 10:45 AM to 11:15 AM (30 minutes).\n- Remain at Russian Hill (or nearby) during free time until traveling to Presidio.\n- Travel to Presidio (14 minutes from Russian Hill) to meet Joseph.\n- Meet Joseph from 6:30 PM to 7:15 PM (45 minutes).\n- Travel to Financial District (23 minutes) to meet Thomas.\n- Meet Thomas from 7:38 PM to 8:23 PM (45 minutes).\n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met, and all friends are visited within their availability windows. The travel times are accounted for between meetings, with no overlaps.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:17 AM\", \"end_time\": \"10:32 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:45 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:15 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:15 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:38 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:23 PM\"}]}",
