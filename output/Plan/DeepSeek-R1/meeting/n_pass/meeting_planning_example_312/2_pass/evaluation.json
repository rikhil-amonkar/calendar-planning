    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: I have optimized the schedule to meet all four friends while respecting their availability windows, minimum meeting times, and travel times. Starting from Richmond District at 9:00 AM, the sequence is designed to minimize waiting and ensure timely arrivals:\n\n- Travel to Mission District first to meet Elizabeth at the start of her window, as she requires the longest meeting time (120 minutes). Leave Richmond at 10:40 AM (20-minute travel) to arrive at 11:00 AM. Meet Elizabeth from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM.\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury to meet Richard next, as his window is tight. Leave Mission at 1:00 PM (12-minute travel) to arrive at 1:12 PM. Meet Richard for 90 minutes from 1:12 PM to 2:42 PM, within his 11:45 AM to 3:45 PM availability.\n- Travel to Sunset District to meet Sarah. Leave Haight-Ashbury at 2:42 PM (15-minute travel) to arrive at 2:57 PM. Sarah is available until 7:00 PM, so meet her from 2:57 PM to 6:04 PM (exceeding the 30-minute minimum to allow travel to the next meeting).\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park for Michelle. Leave Sunset at 6:04 PM (11-minute travel) to arrive at 6:15 PM. Meet Michelle for 90 minutes from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM, within her 6:15 PM to 8:45 PM availability.\n\nAll minimum meeting times are met, travel times are accounted for, and no availability windows are violated.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Monday\", \"start_time\": \"11:00\", \"end_time\": \"13:00\"}, {\"day\": \"Monday\", \"start_time\": \"13:12\", \"end_time\": \"14:42\"}, {\"day\": \"Monday\", \"start_time\": \"14:57\", \"end_time\": \"18:04\"}, {\"day\": \"Monday\", \"start_time\": \"18:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:45\"}]}",
