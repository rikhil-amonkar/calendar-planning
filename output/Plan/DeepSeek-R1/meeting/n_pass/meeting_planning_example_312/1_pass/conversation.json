There is a waiting period until Michelle is available at 6:15 PM.  \n- Meet Michelle from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM.  \n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met: Sarah for 30 minutes, Richard for 90 minutes, Elizabeth for 120 minutes, and Michelle for 90 minutes. The travel times are accounted for, and the only significant waiting period is at Golden Gate Park from 3:43 PM to 6:15 PM, which is unavoidable due to Michelle's late availability.  \n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:  \n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:45 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:15 AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:15 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:26 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"3:26 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Michelle\",\n      \"start_time\": \"6:15 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"7:45 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
