        "content": "SOLUTION:\nI have optimized the schedule to meet all four friends while respecting the minimum meeting times and availability constraints. The sequence minimizes waiting time and travel time as follows:\n\n- Start at Richmond District at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Mission District to meet Elizabeth first, as she has an early availability start and a long meeting requirement. Leave Richmond at 10:40 AM (20 min travel), arrive at Mission at 11:00 AM. Meet Elizabeth from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM (120 min minimum).\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury to meet Richard next, as his availability window is tight. Leave Mission at 1:00 PM (12 min travel), arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 1:12 PM. Meet Richard from 1:12 PM to 2:42 PM (90 min minimum).\n- Travel to Sunset District to meet Sarah. Leave Haight-Ashbury at 2:42 PM (15 min travel), arrive at Sunset at 2:57 PM. Meet Sarah from 2:57 PM to 6:04 PM (exceeding the 30 min minimum to avoid a separate waiting period; Sarah is available until 7:00 PM).\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Michelle last. Leave Sunset at 6:04 PM (11 min travel), arrive at Golden Gate Park at 6:15 PM. Meet Michelle from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM (90 min minimum).\n\nThis schedule meets all friends with minimum or more time, and the travel times are accounted for between meetings.
