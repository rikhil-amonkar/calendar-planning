    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nI have optimized the schedule to meet all four friends while respecting the minimum meeting times and availability constraints. The sequence minimizes waiting time and travel time as follows:\n\n- Start at Richmond District at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Mission District to meet Elizabeth first, as she has an early availability start and a long meeting requirement. Leave Richmond at 10:40 AM (20 min travel), arrive at Mission at 11:00 AM. Meet Elizabeth from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM (120 min minimum).\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury to meet Richard next, as his availability window is tight. Leave Mission at 1:00 PM (12 min travel), arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 1:12 PM. Meet Richard from 1:12 PM to 2:42 PM (90 min minimum).\n- Travel to Sunset District to meet Sarah. Leave Haight-Ashbury at 2:42 PM (15 min travel), arrive at Sunset at 2:57 PM. Meet Sarah from 2:57 PM to 6:04 PM (exceeding the 30 min minimum to avoid a separate waiting period; Sarah is available until 7:00 PM).\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Michelle last. Leave Sunset at 6:04 PM (11 min travel), arrive at Golden Gate Park at 6:15 PM. Meet Michelle from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM (90 min minimum).\n\nThis schedule meets all friends with minimum or more time, and the travel times are accounted for between meetings. The day is not specified in the input, so \"Monday\" is used as a placeholder in the JSON output.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Monday\", \"start_time\": \"11:00\", \"end_time\": \"13:00\"}, {\"day\": \"Monday\", \"start_time\": \"13:12\", \"end_time\": \"14:42\"}, {\"day\": \"Monday\", \"start_time\": \"14:57\", \"end_time\": \"18:04\"}, {\"day\": \"Monday\", \"start_time\": \"18:15\", \"end_time\": \"19:45\"}]}",
