    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo meet all four friends while respecting the minimum meeting times and travel constraints, the optimal schedule is as follows:  \n- Start at Richmond District at 9:00 AM.  \n- Depart for Sunset District at 10:34 AM to arrive by 10:45 AM for the meeting with Sarah.  \n- After meeting Sarah, depart for Haight-Ashbury at 11:15 AM to arrive by 11:30 AM, with a short wait until Richard is available at 11:45 AM.  \n- After meeting Richard, depart for Mission District at 1:15 PM to arrive by 1:26 PM for the meeting with Elizabeth.  \n- After meeting Elizabeth, depart for Golden Gate Park at 3:26 PM to arrive by 3:43 PM. There is a waiting period until Michelle is available at 6:15 PM.  \n- Meet Michelle from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM.  \n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met: Sarah for 30 minutes, Richard for 90 minutes, Elizabeth for 120 minutes, and Michelle for 90 minutes. The travel times are accounted for, and the only significant waiting period is at Golden Gate Park from 3:43 PM to 6:15 PM, which is unavoidable due to Michelle's late availability.  \n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:  \n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:45 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:15 AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:15 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:26 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"3:26 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Michelle\",\n      \"start_time\": \"6:15 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"7:45 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
