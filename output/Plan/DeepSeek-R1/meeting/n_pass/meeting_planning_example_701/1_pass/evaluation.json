    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: The optimal schedule allows meeting 6 friends: Daniel, Timothy, Betty, Kevin, Steven, and Lisa. The constraints and travel times prevent meeting all 8 friends due to conflicts in the evening (Lisa, Ashley, and Elizabeth cannot all be scheduled together). Daniel is met first at Nob Hill for the minimum 15 minutes. Timothy is met at Pacific Heights for 90 minutes starting at noon. Betty is met at Richmond District for 30 minutes in the early afternoon. Kevin is met at Chinatown for 30 minutes shortly after. Steven is met at Marina District for 90 minutes starting at 4:30 PM. Lisa is met at The Castro for the full 120 minutes from 7:15 PM to 9:15 PM. Ashley and Elizabeth cannot be included without violating minimum meeting times or travel constraints. The schedule minimizes waiting time and meets the goals.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"09:12\", \"end_time\": \"09:27\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"12:00\", \"end_time\": \"13:30\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"13:42\", \"end_time\": \"14:12\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"14:32\", \"end_time\": \"15:02\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"16:30\", \"end_time\": \"18:00\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"19:15\", \"end_time\": \"21:15\"}]}",
