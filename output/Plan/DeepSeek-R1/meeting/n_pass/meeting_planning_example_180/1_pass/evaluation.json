After meeting James, travel to The Castro takes 7 minutes, arriving at 2:07 PM. Then, meet Robert for the minimum 30 minutes from 2:07 PM to 2:37 PM, which is within his availability window (12:45 PM to 3:15 PM). \n\nThe time from 9:00 AM to 12:27 PM is spent at North Beach or traveling, but no meetings occur during this period as no other friends are mentioned. This schedule meets both friends, satisfying all constraints.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"12:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:00PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"2:07PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:37PM\"}]}",
