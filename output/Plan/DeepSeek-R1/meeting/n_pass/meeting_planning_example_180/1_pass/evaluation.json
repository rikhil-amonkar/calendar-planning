    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: The only feasible schedule that allows meeting both James and Robert while satisfying all constraints is to meet James first at Mission District from 12:45 PM to 2:00 PM, then travel to The Castro to meet Robert. Travel from Mission District to The Castro takes 7 minutes, so arrival at The Castro is at 2:07 PM. Robert is available until 3:15 PM, and a 30-minute meeting can start at 2:07 PM, ending at 2:37 PM. The time from 9:00 AM to 12:45 PM is spent at North Beach or traveling to Mission District, but no meetings occur during this period, so it is not included in the itinerary. Only meeting actions are listed in the JSON output.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"James\", \"start_time\": \"12:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:00 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"2:07 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:37 PM\"}]}",
