Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nSunset District to North Beach: 29.\nSunset District to Union Square: 30.\nSunset District to Alamo Square: 17.\nNorth Beach to Sunset District: 27.\nNorth Beach to Union Square: 7.\nNorth Beach to Alamo Square: 16.\nUnion Square to Sunset District: 26.\nUnion Square to North Beach: 10.\nUnion Square to Alamo Square: 15.\nAlamo Square to Sunset District: 16.\nAlamo Square to North Beach: 15.\nAlamo Square to Union Square: 14.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM. Sarah will be at North Beach from 4:00PM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 60 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Union Square from 3:00PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 75 minutes. Brian will be at Alamo Square from 4:00PM to 5:30PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nPlease output the meeting schedule in the following JSON format:\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"<DAY>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}]}"

        "content": "SOLUTION:\nAfter considering various schedules, it is impossible to meet all three friends (Sarah, Jeffrey, and Brian) for their minimum desired times due to the overlapping availability of Sarah and Brian starting at 4:00 PM, combined with travel times. Specifically, meeting both Sarah (minimum 60 minutes) and Brian (minimum 75 minutes) within their overlapping windows (4:00 PM to 6:15 PM for Sarah and 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM for Brian) is not feasible because the required meeting times plus travel time exceed the available window. For example:\n- The time from 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM is 90 minutes.\n- Meeting Brian for 75 minutes (e.g., 4:00\u20135:15) leaves only 15 minutes for travel to Sarah, but arriving at 5:30 allows only 45 minutes with Sarah (until 6:15 PM), which is less than the 60-minute minimum.\n- Similarly, meeting Sarah first results in insufficient time for Brian.\n\nThe optimal schedule is to meet Jeffrey and Sarah for their full minimum times, as this allows continuous meetings without splitting and meets the constraints for two friends. Brian cannot be met for the minimum time in this scenario.\n\nSchedule details:\n- Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Union Square: Leave Sunset District at 2:30 PM (30-minute travel), arrive at Union Square at 3:00 PM.\n- Meet Jeffrey at Union Square from 3:00 PM to 4:15 PM (75 minutes, within 3:00 PM to 10:00 PM).\n- Travel to North Beach: Leave Union Square at 4:15 PM (10-minute travel), arrive at North Beach at 4:25 PM.\n- Meet Sarah at North Beach from 4:25 PM to 5:25 PM (60 minutes, within 4:00 PM to 6:15 PM).\n\nBrian is not met for the minimum time, as arriving at Alamo Square after 5:25 PM (e.g., 5:40 PM with travel) would allow only 50 minutes maximum before 5:30 PM, less than the 75-minute minimum.\n\nThus, the best schedule meets two friends with their minimum times.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"3:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:15PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:25PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:25PM\"}]}"
