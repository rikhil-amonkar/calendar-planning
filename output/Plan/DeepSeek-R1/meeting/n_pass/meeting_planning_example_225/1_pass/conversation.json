Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nSunset District to North Beach: 29.\nSunset District to Union Square: 30.\nSunset District to Alamo Square: 17.\nNorth Beach to Sunset District: 27.\nNorth Beach to Union Square: 7.\nNorth Beach to Alamo Square: 16.\nUnion Square to Sunset District: 26.\nUnion Square to North Beach: 10.\nUnion Square to Alamo Square: 15.\nAlamo Square to Sunset District: 16.\nAlamo Square to North Beach: 15.\nAlamo Square to Union Square: 14.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Sunset District at 9:00AM. Sarah will be at North Beach from 4:00PM to 6:15PM. You'd like to meet Sarah for a minimum of 60 minutes. Jeffrey will be at Union Square from 3:00PM to 10:00PM. You'd like to meet Jeffrey for a minimum of 75 minutes. Brian will be at Alamo Square from 4:00PM to 5:30PM. You'd like to meet Brian for a minimum of 75 minutes.\n\nYour response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.\n\nPlease output the meeting schedule in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"<PERSON_NAME>\", \"start_time\": \"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\": \"<HH:MM>\"}]}. Make sure to include the person's name for each meeting."

        "content": "SOLUTION: After considering various schedules, it is not possible to meet all three friends (Sarah, Jeffrey, and Brian) while satisfying the minimum meeting time constraints due to conflicts in their availability and travel times. Specifically, Sarah and Brian both start at 4:00 PM, but the travel time between their locations (15-16 minutes) and Brian's early end time (5:30 PM) make it impossible to meet both for the minimum required times. Meeting Brian for 75 minutes requires ending by 5:30 PM at the latest, and subsequent travel to Sarah would leave insufficient time for a 60-minute meeting before she leaves at 6:15 PM. Similarly, meeting Sarah first and then Brian does not allow for 75 minutes with Brian.\n\nThe optimal schedule is to meet Brian and Jeffrey, as this allows for the minimum meeting times to be satisfied:\n- Meet Brian at Alamo Square from 4:00 PM to 5:15 PM (75 minutes within his 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM window).\n- Then travel to Union Square (14 minutes) to meet Jeffrey from 5:29 PM to 6:44 PM (75 minutes within his flexible 3:00 PM to 10:00 PM window).\n\nSarah cannot be included without compromising the minimum meeting times for Brian or herself. Thus, meeting two friends is the maximum possible.\n\nThe itinerary in the required JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"4:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:15PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"5:29PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:44PM\"}]}"
