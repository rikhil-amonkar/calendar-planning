    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nAfter considering various schedules, it is impossible to meet all three friends (Sarah, Jeffrey, and Brian) for their minimum desired times due to the overlapping availability of Sarah and Brian starting at 4:00 PM, combined with travel times. Specifically, meeting both Sarah (minimum 60 minutes) and Brian (minimum 75 minutes) within their overlapping windows (4:00 PM to 6:15 PM for Sarah and 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM for Brian) is not feasible because the required meeting times plus travel time exceed the available window. For example:\n- The time from 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM is 90 minutes.\n- Meeting Brian for 75 minutes (e.g., 4:00\u20135:15) leaves only 15 minutes for travel to Sarah, but arriving at 5:30 allows only 45 minutes with Sarah (until 6:15 PM), which is less than the 60-minute minimum.\n- Similarly, meeting Sarah first results in insufficient time for Brian.\n\nThe optimal schedule is to meet Jeffrey and Sarah for their full minimum times, as this allows continuous meetings without splitting and meets the constraints for two friends. Brian cannot be met for the minimum time in this scenario.\n\nSchedule details:\n- Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Union Square: Leave Sunset District at 2:30 PM (30-minute travel), arrive at Union Square at 3:00 PM.\n- Meet Jeffrey at Union Square from 3:00 PM to 4:15 PM (75 minutes, within 3:00 PM to 10:00 PM).\n- Travel to North Beach: Leave Union Square at 4:15 PM (10-minute travel), arrive at North Beach at 4:25 PM.\n- Meet Sarah at North Beach from 4:25 PM to 5:25 PM (60 minutes, within 4:00 PM to 6:15 PM).\n\nBrian is not met for the minimum time, as arriving at Alamo Square after 5:25 PM (e.g., 5:40 PM with travel) would allow only 50 minutes maximum before 5:30 PM, less than the 75-minute minimum.\n\nThus, the best schedule meets two friends with their minimum times.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"3:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:15PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:25PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:25PM\"}]}",
