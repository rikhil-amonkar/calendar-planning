    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: After considering various schedules, it is not possible to meet all three friends (Sarah, Jeffrey, and Brian) while satisfying the minimum meeting time constraints due to conflicts in their availability and travel times. Specifically, Sarah and Brian both start at 4:00 PM, but the travel time between their locations (15-16 minutes) and Brian's early end time (5:30 PM) make it impossible to meet both for the minimum required times. Meeting Brian for 75 minutes requires ending by 5:30 PM at the latest, and subsequent travel to Sarah would leave insufficient time for a 60-minute meeting before she leaves at 6:15 PM. Similarly, meeting Sarah first and then Brian does not allow for 75 minutes with Brian.\n\nThe optimal schedule is to meet Brian and Jeffrey, as this allows for the minimum meeting times to be satisfied:\n- Meet Brian at Alamo Square from 4:00 PM to 5:15 PM (75 minutes within his 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM window).\n- Then travel to Union Square (14 minutes) to meet Jeffrey from 5:29 PM to 6:44 PM (75 minutes within his flexible 3:00 PM to 10:00 PM window).\n\nSarah cannot be included without compromising the minimum meeting times for Brian or herself. Thus, meeting two friends is the maximum possible.\n\nThe itinerary in the required JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"4:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:15PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"5:29PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:44PM\"}]}",
