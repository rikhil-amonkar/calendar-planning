    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule allows meeting all six friends while respecting the minimum meeting times and availability windows, with travel times accounted for between districts. The itinerary begins at The Castro at 9:00 AM, and meetings are scheduled in an order that minimizes waiting time and ensures all constraints are satisfied. The meetings are as follows:  \n\n1. **Mark** at Russian Hill from 10:00 AM to 11:15 AM (75 minutes, within his 10:00 AM to 9:15 PM window).  \n   - Travel from The Castro to Russian Hill takes 18 minutes; arrive at 9:18 AM, but meeting starts at 10:00 AM when Mark is available.  \n2. **Robert** at Golden Gate Park from 2:15 PM to 3:00 PM (45 minutes, within his 2:15 PM to 9:30 PM window).  \n   - Travel from Russian Hill to Golden Gate Park takes 21 minutes; leave Russian Hill at 11:15 AM, arrive at Golden Gate Park at 11:36 AM, and wait until 2:15 PM.  \n3. **William** at Mission District from 3:17 PM to 3:47 PM (30 minutes, within his 1:15 PM to 7:30 PM window).  \n   - Travel from Golden Gate Park to Mission District takes 17 minutes; leave Golden Gate Park at 3:00 PM, arrive at Mission District at 3:17 PM, and meet immediately.  \n4. **Linda** at Sunset District from 4:11 PM to 4:41 PM (30 minutes, within her 3:30 PM to 7:45 PM window).  \n   - Travel from Mission District to Sunset District takes 24 minutes; leave Mission District at 3:47 PM, arrive at Sunset District at 4:11 PM, and meet immediately.  \n5. **Elizabeth** at Haight-Ashbury from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 minutes, within her 5:15 PM to 7:30 PM window).  \n   - Travel from Sunset District to Haight-Ashbury takes 15 minutes; leave Sunset District at 4:41 PM, arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 4:56 PM, and wait until 5:15 PM.  \n6. **Rebecca** at Presidio from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM (60 minutes, within her 6:15 PM to 8:45 PM window).  \n   - Travel from Haight-Ashbury to Presidio takes 15 minutes; leave Haight-Ashbury at 7:00 PM, arrive at Presidio at 7:15 PM, and meet immediately.  \n\nThis schedule meets all minimum time requirements and availability constraints, with a total of six friends met. The waiting times (e.g., at Golden Gate Park from 11:36 AM to 2:15 PM) are due to the gap between Mark's meeting and Robert's availability, but this is unavoidable given the constraints.  \n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:  \n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"William\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:17\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:47\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Linda\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:11\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:41\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
