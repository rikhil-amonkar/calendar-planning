    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nI have considered various schedules to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints, including travel times, availability windows, and minimum meeting durations. After evaluating different sequences, I found a schedule that allows meeting all eight friends by minimizing waiting times and ensuring travel is efficient. The key insights are:\n- Start with Elizabeth in the Financial District early to utilize the morning window.\n- Meet Joseph in Union Square next, as his window starts right after Elizabeth's meeting and requires a long duration.\n- Proceed to Kimberly in Haight-Ashbury early in the afternoon to accommodate her 105-minute minimum during her limited window.\n- Meet Richard in Fisherman's Wharf for a short 30-minute session after Kimberly, as his window ends at 5:30 PM.\n- Travel to Helen in Sunset District for her 105-minute meeting, starting after Richard.\n- Meet Karen in Mission District for a short 30-minute session in the evening.\n- Meet Ashley in Russian Hill for 45 minutes, leveraging her flexible window.\n- End with Robert in Presidio for 60 minutes, starting exactly at 9:45 PM.\n\nAll travel times are accounted for, and meetings fit within the friends' availability. This schedule meets all minimum durations and allows no missed friends.\n\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:00\", \"end_time\": \"11:15\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"13:45\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:15\", \"end_time\": \"16:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"16:23\", \"end_time\": \"16:53\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:20\", \"end_time\": \"19:05\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:30\", \"end_time\": \"20:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"20:15\", \"end_time\": \"21:00\"},\n    {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"21:45\", \"end_time\": \"22:45\"}\n  ]\n}",
