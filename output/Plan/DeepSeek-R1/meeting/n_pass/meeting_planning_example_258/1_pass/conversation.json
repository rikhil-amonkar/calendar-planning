Starting from Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, the schedule begins with Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf, leveraging her early availability. After meeting Barbara for an extended period (180 minutes, exceeding the 120-minute minimum), the schedule proceeds to Betty at Presidio and then to David at Richmond District. This sequence avoids significant waiting time, with only a brief initial wait for Barbara. Travel times are factored in, ensuring all meetings occur within the friends' availability windows.  \n\nThe meeting schedule in JSON format:  \n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:15 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:15 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"12:32 PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:17 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"1:24 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:54 PM\"}]}  \n\nThis schedule corresponds to:  \n- Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15 AM to 12:15 PM (180 minutes, meeting the 120-minute minimum).  \n- Betty at Presidio from 12:32 PM to 1:17 PM (45 minutes, meeting the minimum).  \n- David at Richmond District from 1:24 PM to 2:54 PM (90 minutes, meeting the minimum).  \n\nAll constraints are satisfied, and this is the most efficient sequence to meet all friends with minimal idle time."
