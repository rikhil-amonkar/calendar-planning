Starting at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, the best sequence is to meet Barbara first at Fisherman's Wharf, then Betty at Presidio, and finally David at Richmond District. This schedule avoids significant waiting times and completes by 2:30 PM.  \n\n- Depart Embarcadero at 9:09 AM to arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:15 AM (travel time 6 minutes).  \n- Meet Barbara from 9:15 AM to 11:15 AM (120 minutes).  \n- Depart Fisherman's Wharf at 11:15 AM and arrive at Presidio at 11:32 AM (travel time 17 minutes).  \n- Meet Betty from 11:32 AM to 12:53 PM (81 minutes, exceeding the 45-minute minimum).  \n- Depart Presidio at 12:53 PM and arrive at Richmond District at 1:00 PM (travel time 7 minutes).  \n- Meet David from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM (90 minutes).  \n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met with no idle time during the day (except for the short wait at the start from 9:00 AM to 9:09 AM at Embarcadero, which is not part of the meeting itinerary).  \n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"9:15 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:15 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Betty\", \"start_time\": \"11:32 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:53 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"1:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:30 PM\"}]}",
