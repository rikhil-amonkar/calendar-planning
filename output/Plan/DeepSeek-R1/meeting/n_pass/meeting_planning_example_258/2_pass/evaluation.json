    "execution_output": "After reviewing the previous solution, the constraint violation was that David's meeting did not start until 1:24 PM, despite his availability beginning at 1:00 PM. While starting at 1:24 PM is within his window, the schedule can be optimized to start David's meeting exactly at 1:00 PM to better align with his availability and reduce any perceived delay.\n\nThe revised schedule meets all friends for the minimum required times, accounts for travel durations, and minimizes waiting time:\n- Start with Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15 AM to 11:15 AM (120 minutes minimum met, with no travel needed as arrival at 9:06 AM allows waiting until 9:15 AM).\n- Travel to Presidio (17 minutes), arriving at 11:32 AM, and meet Betty from 11:32 AM to 12:53 PM (81 minutes, exceeding the 45-minute minimum).\n- Travel to Richmond District (7 minutes), arriving at 1:00 PM, and meet David from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM (90 minutes minimum met).\n\nThis schedule ensures:\n- All travel times are accounted for and fit within the sequence.\n- David starts at exactly 1:00 PM, utilizing his full availability window.\n- No waiting time except the initial 9 minutes for Barbara.\n- All minimum meeting durations are satisfied or exceeded.\n\nSOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule starts with Barbara to leverage her early availability, then meets Betty with sufficient time to travel to David for a prompt 1:00 PM start. This sequence minimizes idle time and adheres to all constraints.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:15 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:15 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"11:32 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:53 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"1:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:30 PM\"}]}",
