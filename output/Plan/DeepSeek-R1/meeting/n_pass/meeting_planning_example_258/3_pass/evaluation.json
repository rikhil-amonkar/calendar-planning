Meet Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf first, leveraging her early availability. Arrive at 9:06AM after 6 minutes travel from Embarcadero, wait until her 9:15AM availability start, and meet for exactly 120 minutes until 11:15AM.\n\n2. Travel to Presidio (17 minutes) to meet Betty, arriving at 11:32AM. Meet for 81 minutes (exceeding the 45-minute minimum) until 12:53PM.\n\n3. Travel to Richmond District (7 minutes) to meet David, arriving exactly at his 1:00PM availability start. Meet for exactly 90 minutes until 2:30PM.\n\nThis schedule:\n- Meets all three friends\n- Satisfies minimum meeting durations\n- Honors all availability windows\n- Minimizes waiting time (only 9 minutes initial wait for Barbara)\n- Accounts for all travel times\n- Has David starting precisely at 1:00PM\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\"meetings\": [\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"9:15AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:15AM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"11:32AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:53PM\"},\n    {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"1:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:30PM\"}\n]}",
