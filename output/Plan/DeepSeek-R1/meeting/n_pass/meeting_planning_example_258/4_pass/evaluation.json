    "execution_output": "After reviewing the previous solutions and constraints, I identified that the primary issue was the meeting duration for Betty. While the 81-minute meeting satisfied the minimum 45-minute requirement, the schedule can be optimized to reduce the meeting duration closer to the minimum, thereby allowing more flexibility. The revised schedule meets all constraints while minimizing waiting time and travel:\n\n1. **Barbara (Fisherman's Wharf)**:  \n   - Start: 9:15 AM (after 9 min wait from 9:06 AM arrival)  \n   - End: 11:15 AM (120 minutes, meets minimum)  \n   - Travel to Presidio: 17 minutes  \n\n2. **Betty (Presidio)**:  \n   - Arrival: 11:32 AM  \n   - Start: 11:32 AM (within 10:30 AM\u20132:00 PM window)  \n   - End: 12:17 PM (45 minutes, meets minimum)  \n   - Travel to Richmond District: 7 minutes  \n\n3. **David (Richmond District)**:  \n   - Arrival: 12:24 PM  \n   - Wait: 36 minutes (until David's 1:00 PM availability)  \n   - Start: 1:00 PM  \n   - End: 2:30 PM (90 minutes, meets minimum)  \n\n**Why this works**:  \n- All meetings occur within friends' availability windows.  \n- Minimum meeting durations are satisfied.  \n- Total waiting time (9 min + 36 min = 45 min) is minimized given constraints.  \n- David starts exactly at 1:00 PM as required.  \n- Travel times are fully accounted for.  \n\n**JSON Schedule**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"Today\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:15 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:15 AM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"Today\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:32 AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:17 PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"Today\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:00 PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"2:30 PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
