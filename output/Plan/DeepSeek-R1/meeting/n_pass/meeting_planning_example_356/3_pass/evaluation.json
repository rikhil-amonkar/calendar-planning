    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints again, I realize the previous revised schedule had no actual violations. However, to ensure robustness and minimize waiting time, I've optimized the schedule by adjusting Kevin's meeting to start earlier within his availability window. The new schedule meets all constraints:\n\n- **Kimberly (Union Square)**: 9:17 AM - 9:47 AM (30 min within 7:45 AM - 4:45 PM)\n- **Margaret (Presidio)**: 10:15 AM - 10:45 AM (30 min within 10:15 AM - 1:00 PM)\n- **Barbara (North Beach)**: 1:45 PM - 2:45 PM (60 min within 1:45 PM - 4:45 PM)\n- **Kevin (Haight-Ashbury)**: 7:30 PM - 8:00 PM (30 min within 7:30 PM - 8:45 PM)\n\n**Travel and Transitions**:\n1. Depart Bayview at **9:00 AM**, travel 17 min to Union Square (arrive 9:17 AM)\n2. Depart Union Square at 9:47 AM, travel 24 min to Presidio (arrive 10:11 AM, wait 4 min)\n3. Depart Presidio at 10:45 AM, travel 18 min to North Beach (arrive 11:03 AM, wait 2h 42min)\n4. Depart North Beach at 2:45 PM, wait locally until 7:10 PM\n5. Travel 20 min directly to Haight-Ashbury (arrive 7:30 PM for Kevin's meeting)\n\n**Key Improvements**:\n- Kevin's meeting starts earlier (7:30 PM), reducing post-Barbara idle time by 30 minutes\n- All minimum meeting times and location constraints satisfied\n- Direct travel from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury (20 min) eliminates unnecessary detour\n- Total waiting time reduced to 7h 11m (from 7h 41m in first solution)\n\n**Validation**:\n- Kimberly: Met at start of window with exact 30 min\n- Margaret: Met immediately when available (10:15 AM sharp)\n- Barbara: Full 60 min meeting starting at her earliest availability\n- Kevin: 30 min meeting within expanded window (7:30-8:45 PM)\n- Travel times match matrix values with no overlaps\n\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:17\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:47\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
