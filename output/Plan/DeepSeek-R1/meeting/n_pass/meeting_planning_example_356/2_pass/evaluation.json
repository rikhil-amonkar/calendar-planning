    "execution_output": "After reviewing the constraints, I realize the previous schedule violated the requirement to meet Kimberly at Union Square within her availability window (7:45 AM to 4:45 PM). The meeting with Kimberly ended at 9:47 AM, which is acceptable, but the schedule could be optimized to reduce waiting time. Here's the revised plan:\n\n1. Start at Bayview (9:00 AM)\n2. Travel to Presidio (31 min, arrive 9:31 AM)\n3. Meet Margaret at Presidio (10:15-10:45 AM, after 44 min wait)\n4. Travel to North Beach (17 min, arrive 11:02 AM)\n5. Meet Barbara at North Beach (1:45-2:45 PM, after 2h43m wait)\n6. Travel to Union Square (7 min, arrive 2:52 PM)\n7. Meet Kimberly at Union Square (2:52-3:22 PM)\n8. Travel to Haight-Ashbury (18 min, depart 7:42 PM, arrive 8:00 PM)\n9. Meet Kevin at Haight-Ashbury (8:00-8:30 PM)\n\nThis schedule meets all friends while respecting:\n- Minimum meeting times (Barbara: 60 min, others: 30 min)\n- Availability windows (Kimberly met before 4:45 PM)\n- Travel times (as per table)\n- No overlapping meetings\n\nSOLUTION: The revised schedule meets all four friends while respecting constraints. Key improvements include meeting Kimberly later in the day (within her availability) and reducing total waiting time through optimized sequencing.\n\n{\"meetings\": [\n{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:15\", \"end_time\": \"10:45\"},\n{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"13:45\", \"end_time\": \"14:45\"},\n{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:52\", \"end_time\": \"15:22\"},\n{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"20:30\"}\n]}",
