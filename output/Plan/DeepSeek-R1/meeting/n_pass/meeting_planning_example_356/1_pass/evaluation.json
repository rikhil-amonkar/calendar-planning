    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo meet as many friends as possible while respecting the time constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule involves visiting the friends in the following order: Kimberly at Union Square first, then Margaret at Presidio, followed by Barbara at North Beach, and finally Kevin at Haight-Ashbury. This sequence minimizes waiting time and ensures all minimum meeting durations are met within the availability windows.  \n\n- Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel to Union Square (17 minutes) to meet Kimberly from 9:17 AM to 9:47 AM (30 minutes).  \n- Travel to Presidio (24 minutes) to meet Margaret from 10:15 AM to 10:45 AM (30 minutes; arrival at 10:11 AM, wait until 10:15 AM).  \n- Travel to North Beach (18 minutes) to meet Barbara from 1:45 PM to 2:45 PM (60 minutes; arrive by 1:45 PM).  \n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury (18 minutes) to meet Kevin from 8:00 PM to 8:30 PM (30 minutes; leave North Beach at 7:42 PM to arrive at 8:00 PM).  \n\nThis schedule allows meeting all four friends, with free time between meetings accounted for but not listed in the itinerary. The travel times are based on the given directional values and are factored into the arrival times.  \n\nOutput in JSON format:  \n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:17\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:47\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Margaret\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
