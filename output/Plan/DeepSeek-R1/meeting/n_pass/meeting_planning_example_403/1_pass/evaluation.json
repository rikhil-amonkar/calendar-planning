    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule allows you to meet all five friends by minimizing travel time and idle time while respecting the minimum meeting durations and availability windows. The schedule is as follows:  \n\n- Start at Union Square at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel to Chinatown (7 minutes) to meet Rebecca first, as it is close and her availability is flexible.  \n- Then travel to Golden Gate Park (23 minutes from Chinatown) to meet Andrew within his tight window.  \n- Next, travel to The Castro (13 minutes from Golden Gate Park) to meet Robert before his availability ends.  \n- After meeting Robert, there is idle time until the evening meetings.  \n- For Sarah and Nancy, meet Sarah later in her window at Pacific Heights, then travel to Presidio (11 minutes) to meet Nancy, starting just after her window opens to minimize waiting.  \n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met:  \n- Rebecca: 90 minutes (9:45 AM to 11:15 AM).  \n- Andrew: 75 minutes (11:45 AM to 1:00 PM).  \n- Robert: 30 minutes (1:13 PM to 1:43 PM).  \n- Sarah: 15 minutes (5:14 PM to 5:29 PM).  \n- Nancy: 60 minutes (5:40 PM to 6:40 PM).  \n\nTravel times are accounted for, and all meetings fit within the friends' availability. The idle time from 1:43 PM to 4:58 PM (when departing for Sarah) is unavoidable due to the gap between afternoon and evening availabilities, but it does not conflict with any meetings.  \n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:  \n```json\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:15AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:00PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:13PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:43PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:14PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:29PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:40PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:40PM\"}]}\n```",
