    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nTo meet as many friends as possible while respecting the minimum meeting durations and travel times, the optimal schedule involves meeting all five friends: Rebecca, Andrew, Robert, Sarah, and Nancy. The itinerary is designed to minimize waiting time and ensure all meetings fit within the available time windows, accounting for travel between locations.  \n\n- Start at Union Square at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel to Chinatown (7 minutes) to meet Rebecca first, as she is available earliest and for a long duration. Arrive at 9:07 AM, but wait until her availability starts at 9:45 AM. Meet for 90 minutes, ending at 11:15 AM.  \n- Travel to Golden Gate Park (23 minutes) to meet Andrew. Arrive at 11:38 AM, but wait until his availability starts at 11:45 AM. Meet for 75 minutes, ending at 1:00 PM.  \n- Travel to The Castro (13 minutes) to meet Robert. Arrive at 1:13 PM, and meet for 30 minutes (minimum duration), ending at 1:43 PM. Robert is available until 2:15 PM, so this is feasible.  \n- Travel to Pacific Heights (16 minutes) to meet Sarah. Arrive at 1:59 PM, but wait until her availability starts at 4:15 PM. Meet for 15 minutes (minimum duration), ending at 4:30 PM.  \n- Travel to Presidio (11 minutes) to meet Nancy. Arrive at 4:41 PM, but wait until her availability starts at 5:30 PM. Meet for 60 minutes, ending at 6:30 PM.  \n\nThis schedule meets all friends, with the minimum durations satisfied. The unavoidable waiting times (e.g., at Pacific Heights from 1:59 PM to 4:15 PM) are due to the gap between Robert's meeting ending and Sarah's availability starting, but this does not prevent meeting all five.  \n\nJSON Itinerary:  \n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Rebecca\", \"start_time\": \"9:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:15AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Andrew\", \"start_time\": \"11:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:00PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"1:13PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:43PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sarah\", \"start_time\": \"4:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:30PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Nancy\", \"start_time\": \"5:30PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:30PM\"}]}",
