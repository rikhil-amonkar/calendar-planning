Andrew will be at Golden Gate Park from 11:45AM to 2:30PM. You'd like to meet Andrew for a minimum of 75 minutes. Sarah will be at Pacific Heights from 4:15PM to 6:45PM.

The schedule is as follows:  \n\n- Start at Union Square at 9:00 AM.  \n- Travel to Chinatown (7 minutes) to meet Rebecca first, as it is close and her availability is flexible.  \n- Then travel to Golden Gate Park (23 minutes from Chinatown) to meet Andrew within his tight window.  \n- Next, travel to The Castro (13 minutes from Golden Gate Park) to meet Robert before his availability ends.  \n- After meeting Robert, there is idle time until the evening meetings.  \n- For Sarah and Nancy, meet Sarah later in her window at Pacific Heights, then travel to Presidio (11 minutes) to meet Nancy, starting just after her window opens to minimize waiting.  \n\nThis schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met:  \n- Rebecca: 90 minutes (9:45 AM to 11:15 AM).  \n- Andrew: 75 minutes (11:45 AM to 1:00 PM).  \n- Robert: 30 minutes (1:13 PM to 1:43 PM).  \n- Sarah: 15 minutes (5:14 PM to 5:29 PM).  \n- Nancy: 60 minutes (5:40 PM to 6:40 PM).  \n\nTravel times are accounted for, and all meetings fit within the friends' availability. The idle time from 1:43 PM to 4:58 PM (when departing for Sarah) is unavoidable due to the gap between afternoon and evening availabilities, but it does not conflict with any meetings.  \n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:  \n```json\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"9:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:15AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:45AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:00PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:13PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:43PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:14PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:29PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:40PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:40PM\"}]}\n```"
