    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To meet both friends while adhering to the minimum meeting times and travel constraints, the optimal schedule involves meeting Kenneth first at Mission District and then Thomas at Pacific Heights. This order is necessary because Kenneth's availability ends at 3:45 PM, and meeting Thomas first would make it impossible to meet Kenneth afterward due to travel times and availability windows.\n\n- Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Mission District to meet Kenneth: Leave Nob Hill at 2:16 PM to account for the 13-minute travel time, arriving at Mission District at 2:29 PM.\n- Meet Kenneth for exactly 45 minutes from 2:29 PM to 3:14 PM, satisfying the minimum requirement.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights to meet Thomas: Leave Mission District at 3:14 PM, taking 16 minutes to arrive at Pacific Heights at 3:30 PM.\n- Meet Thomas for exactly 75 minutes from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM, satisfying the minimum requirement.\n\nThis schedule minimizes idle time by aligning the meetings closely with travel, ensuring no waiting time at either location beyond the scheduled meetings.\n\nOutput in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:29\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:14\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Thomas\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
