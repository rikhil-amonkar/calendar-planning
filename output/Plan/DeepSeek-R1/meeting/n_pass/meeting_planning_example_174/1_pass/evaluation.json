    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nThe optimal schedule is to meet Kenneth first at Mission District and then meet Thomas at Pacific Heights, ensuring both minimum meeting times are satisfied with efficient travel. To avoid waiting between meetings, Kenneth's meeting ends at 3:14 PM, allowing arrival at Pacific Heights exactly at 3:30 PM for Thomas's meeting. The schedule is as follows:\n\n- Leave Nob Hill at 2:16 PM to arrive at Mission District at 2:29 PM.\n- Meet Kenneth from 2:29 PM to 3:14 PM (45 minutes).\n- Leave Mission District at 3:14 PM to arrive at Pacific Heights at 3:30 PM.\n- Meet Thomas from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM (75 minutes).\n\nThis meets both friends with no waiting time between the second meeting and travel, and satisfies all constraints.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"2:29 PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:14 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"3:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:45 PM\"}]}",
