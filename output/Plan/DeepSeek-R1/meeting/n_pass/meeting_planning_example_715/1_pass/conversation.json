        "content": "SOLUTION: After evaluating various schedules, the optimal solution meets 7 friends while adhering to all constraints and minimum meeting times. The schedule maximizes the number of meetings by sequencing locations efficiently and accounting for travel times. Robert (at Alamo Square) could not be included without violating time constraints for others, as the minimum meeting times and travel durations make it impossible to fit all 8 friends within the available time.\n\nThe schedule is as follows:\n- Start at Joseph (Golden Gate Park) at 9:12 AM, meeting for 105 minutes.\n- Then meet Melissa (The Castro) at 11:10 AM for 30 minutes.\n- Then meet Matthew (Bayview) at 11:59 AM for 30 minutes.\n- Then meet Jeffrey (Fisherman's Wharf) at 12:54 PM for 120 minutes.\n- Then meet Amanda (Marina District) at 3:03 PM for 105 minutes.\n- Then meet Karen (Mission District) at 5:30 PM for 105 minutes.\n- Finally meet Nancy (Pacific Heights) at 7:31 PM for 105 minutes.\n\nThis schedule ensures all meetings are within the friends' availability windows and meet the minimum duration requirements. Travel times are factored into the transitions, and the day ends at 9:16 PM.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"meetings\": [\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:12\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:57\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:10\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:40\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:59\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:29\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:54\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:54\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:03\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:48\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day\": \"1\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:31\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:16\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
