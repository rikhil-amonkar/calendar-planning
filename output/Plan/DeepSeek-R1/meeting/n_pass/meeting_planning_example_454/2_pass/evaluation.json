The sequence remains optimal: meet Daniel first (since he has the earliest deadline), then Ronald, Jessica, William, and finally Ashley. Travel times are strictly adhered to, with waiting periods where necessary.\n\n- Start at Presidio at 9:00 AM, travel 26 min to Mission District (arrive 9:26 AM).  \n- Meet Daniel for 105 min (ends at 11:11 AM, within his 11:15 AM deadline).  \n- Travel 16 min to Chinatown (arrive 11:27 AM).  \n- Meet Ronald for 115 min (ends at 1:22 PM, within his 2:45 PM window).  \n- Travel 23 min to Golden Gate Park (arrive 1:45 PM).  \n- Meet Jessica for 30 min (ends at 2:15 PM, within her 3:00 PM window).  \n- Travel 24 min to North Beach (arrive 2:39 PM).  \n- Meet William for 15 min (ends at 2:54 PM, within his 8:15 PM window).  \n- Wait at North Beach until 4:53 PM (Ashley not available until 5:15 PM).  \n- Travel 22 min to Bayview (arrive 5:15 PM).  \n- Meet Ashley for 105 min (ends at 7:00 PM, within her 8:00 PM window).  \n\nAll minimum meeting times and availability windows are satisfied.\n\n{\"meetings\": [\n{\"day\": \"2024-07-15\", \"start_time\": \"9:26AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:11AM\"},\n{\"day\": \"2024-07-15\", \"start_time\": \"11:27AM\", \"end_time\": \"1:22PM\"},\n{\"day\": \"2024-07-15\", \"start_time\": \"1:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:15PM\"},\n{\"day\": \"2024-07-15\", \"start_time\": \"2:39PM\", \"end_time\": \"2:54PM\"},\n{\"day\": \"2024-07-15\", \"start_time\": \"5:15PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:00PM\"}\n]}",
