        "content": "SOLUTION: I have created an optimized schedule that allows you to meet all five friends while satisfying the minimum meeting times and travel constraints. The schedule starts at Presidio at 9:00 AM, and after traveling to Mission District, you meet Daniel first due to his early departure time. Then, you proceed to meet Ronald, Jessica, William, and finally Ashley, with all minimum meeting times met and travel times accounted for. Although there is waiting time before meeting Ashley, this is acceptable as it does not conflict with meeting any other friends.
