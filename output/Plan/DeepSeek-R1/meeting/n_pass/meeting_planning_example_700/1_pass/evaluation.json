    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: After evaluating the constraints and travel times, the optimal schedule allows meeting five friends: Helen, Emily, Mary, Laura, and Michelle. Kevin cannot be met due to arriving after his availability window. Barbara and Mark conflict with other meetings when maximizing the number of friends met. The schedule is as follows:\n\n- Start at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n- Meet Helen at North Beach from 11:00 AM to 11:45 AM (45 minutes, within her 11:00 AM to 12:15 PM window).\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (5 minutes), arriving by 4:15 PM to meet Emily.\n- Meet Emily at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM (30 minutes, within her 4:15 PM to 7:00 PM window).\n- Travel to Nob Hill (11 minutes), arriving by 5:30 PM to meet Mary.\n- Meet Mary at Nob Hill from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM (45 minutes, within her 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM window).\n- Travel to Sunset District (24 minutes), arriving by 7:00 PM to meet Laura.\n- Meet Laura at Sunset District from 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM (75 minutes, within her 7:00 PM to 9:15 PM window).\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park (11 minutes), arriving by 8:26 PM to meet Michelle.\n- Meet Michelle at Golden Gate Park from 8:26 PM to 8:41 PM (15 minutes, within her 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM window).\n\nThis schedule meets the minimum time requirements and accounts for all travel times, allowing five friends to be met. Barbara cannot be included without conflicting with Emily or other meetings due to her fixed 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM window and travel constraints. Mark cannot be included without conflicting with Laura or Michelle.\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:00 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:45 AM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"4:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:45 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:15 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:15 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"8:26 PM\", \"end_time\": \"8:41 PM\"}]}",
