        "content": "SOLUTION:\nTo meet as many friends as possible while respecting the minimum meeting times and travel constraints, the optimal schedule involves meeting Helen, Emily, Mary, Mark, and Laura. Kevin cannot be met because his availability ends before you arrive at 9:00 AM. Barbara cannot be included because meeting her for the required 120 minutes from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM conflicts with meeting other friends like Emily, Mary, or Mark during that time. Michelle is not included because meeting her would conflict with meeting Laura for the full 75 minutes, given the travel times.\n\nThe schedule is as follows:\n- Start at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to North Beach (18 minutes) to meet Helen from 11:00 AM to 11:45 AM (45 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- After Helen, travel to Fisherman's Wharf (5 minutes) to meet Emily from 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM (30 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- After Emily, travel to Nob Hill (11 minutes) to meet Mary from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM (45 minutes, meeting the minimum; note that you arrive early at 4:56 PM but wait until Mary is available).\n- After Mary, travel to Marina District (11 minutes) to meet Mark from 6:26 PM to 7:41 PM (75 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n- After Mark, travel to Sunset District (19 minutes) to meet Laura from 8:00 PM to 9:15 PM (75 minutes, meeting the minimum).\n\nThis schedule meets 5 friends, which is the maximum possible given the constraints. Michelle is skipped to ensure Laura's minimum time is met, and Barbara is skipped to allow meeting Emily, Mary, and Mark.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Helen\", \"start_time\": \"11:00 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:45 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Emily\", \"start_time\": \"4:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"4:45 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"5:30 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:15 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mark\", \"start_time\": \"6:26 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:41 PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Laura\", \"start_time\": \"8:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:15 PM\"}]}"
