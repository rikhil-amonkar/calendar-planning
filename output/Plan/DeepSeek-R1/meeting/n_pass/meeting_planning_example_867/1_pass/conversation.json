        "content": "SOLUTION: I can meet all 9 friends by starting at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM and following an optimized schedule that respects travel times and availability windows. The schedule minimizes waiting time and ensures all minimum meeting durations are met. After considering various sequences, the best schedule involves meeting Amanda first at Golden Gate Park due to proximity, then proceeding to friends with tighter time windows (Robert and Kenneth), followed by Kimberly for her long meeting, Sandra, David, Elizabeth, Melissa, and finally Thomas. Travel times are accounted for between each meeting, and all meetings fit within the friends' availability.\n\nThe meeting schedule in the specified JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:07\", \"end_time\": \"09:22\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:00\", \"end_time\": \"10:15\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"10:45\", \"end_time\": \"11:30\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:49\", \"end_time\": \"13:34\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"13:55\", \"end_time\": \"15:55\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"16:07\", \"end_time\": \"16:52\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"17:06\", \"end_time\": \"18:36\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:56\", \"end_time\": \"19:11\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:38\", \"end_time\": \"20:08\"}]}"
