    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nTo meet both Emily and Margaret while satisfying all constraints, the optimal schedule involves starting at North Beach at 9:00 AM, traveling to Union Square to meet Emily for the full available duration within her window (since it exceeds the minimum 45 minutes), and then traveling to Russian Hill to meet Margaret for the required 120 minutes from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. \n\n- Emily is available from 4:00 PM to 5:15 PM (75 minutes). Meeting her for 75 minutes (from 4:00 PM to 5:15 PM) satisfies the minimum of 45 minutes and maximizes time with her.\n- After meeting Emily, travel from Union Square to Russian Hill takes 13 minutes, arriving at 5:28 PM. This allows ample time before Margaret's availability at 7:00 PM.\n- Margaret must be met from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM for exactly 120 minutes, as her window is fixed.\n- The itinerary only includes the meeting actions, not travel or waiting periods, as per the required JSON format.\n\nThis schedule ensures both friends are met with no conflicts, using the given travel times and constraints.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Emily\", \"start_time\": \"16:00\", \"end_time\": \"17:15\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Margaret\", \"start_time\": \"19:00\", \"end_time\": \"21:00\"}]}",
