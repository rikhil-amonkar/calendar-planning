    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nThe optimal schedule allows you to meet both friends, Emily and Margaret, fulfilling the minimum time requirements. After considering various schedules, the best sequence is to start at North Beach, travel to Union Square to meet Emily for 45 minutes from 4:30 PM to 5:15 PM, then travel to Russian Hill to meet Margaret for the full 120 minutes from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. This minimizes unnecessary travel and waiting time while ensuring both meetings fit within the constraints.  \n\n- You arrive at North Beach at 9:00 AM and stay there until departing for Union Square.  \n- Depart North Beach at 4:23 PM (travel time 7 minutes) to arrive at Union Square at 4:30 PM.  \n- Meet Emily from 4:30 PM to 5:15 PM (45 minutes within her 4:00 PM to 5:15 PM availability).  \n- Depart Union Square at 5:15 PM (travel time 13 minutes) to arrive at Russian Hill at 5:28 PM.  \n- Wait at Russian Hill until 7:00 PM, then meet Margaret from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM (120 minutes within her availability).  \n\nThis schedule meets both friends with minimal travel time (20 minutes total: 7 minutes + 13 minutes) and no conflicts.  \n\nOutput in specified JSON format:  \n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"16:30\", \"end_time\": \"17:15\"}, {\"day\": \"Today\", \"start_time\": \"19:00\", \"end_time\": \"21:00\"}]}",
