    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:  \nI have optimized the schedule to meet all seven friends by minimizing travel time and waiting time, while respecting all constraints and minimum meeting durations. The schedule starts at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM and sequences meetings in a way that clusters activities geographically where possible, reducing travel. The key is to handle early and late constraints efficiently:  \n- Karen must be met early (available until 2:00 PM) with a 75-minute minimum.  \n- Deborah has a tight window (12:00 PM to 3:00 PM) with a 105-minute minimum, requiring a dedicated block.  \n- Jason and Steven both start at 2:45 PM, but their locations are close, allowing a sequence.  \n- Laura and Elizabeth have long availability windows, so they are scheduled later.  \n- Carol is only available from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM, so she is scheduled last with travel from Chinatown.  \n\nTravel times are incorporated, and waiting times are minimized (e.g., at Alamo Square and North Beach). The final schedule allows meeting all friends:  \n1. **Karen at The Castro**: Start after travel from Golden Gate Park (13 min), meeting from 9:13 AM to 10:28 AM (75 minutes).  \n2. **Deborah at Alamo Square**: Travel from The Castro (8 min), arrive early and wait, then meet from 12:00 PM to 1:45 PM (105 minutes).  \n3. **Jason at North Beach**: Travel from Alamo Square (15 min), arrive early and wait, then meet from 2:45 PM to 4:15 PM (90 minutes).  \n4. **Steven at Russian Hill**: Travel from North Beach (4 min), meet from 4:19 PM to 6:19 PM (120 minutes).  \n5. **Laura at Fisherman's Wharf**: Travel from Russian Hill (7 min), meet from 6:26 PM to 7:26 PM (60 minutes).  \n6. **Elizabeth at Chinatown**: Travel from Fisherman's Wharf (12 min), meet from 7:38 PM to 8:53 PM (75 minutes).  \n7. **Carol at Haight-Ashbury**: Travel from Chinatown (19 min), arrive early and wait, then meet from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM (60 minutes).  \n\nThis schedule meets all minimum times and availability constraints. Total meetings: 7 (all friends).  \n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"09:13\", \"end_time\": \"10:28\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:00\", \"end_time\": \"13:45\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"14:45\", \"end_time\": \"16:15\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"16:19\", \"end_time\": \"18:19\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"18:26\", \"end_time\": \"19:26\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"19:38\", \"end_time\": \"20:53\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"21:30\", \"end_time\": \"22:30\"}]}",
