    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: After evaluating various schedules to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints (arrival time, availability windows, minimum meeting durations, and travel times), the optimal schedule allows meeting 7 friends: Richard, Elizabeth, Kenneth, Ashley, Deborah, Kimberly, and Jessica. Matthew cannot be met due to the arrival time at Bayview (9:00 AM) conflicting with his availability (ending at 9:00 AM at Presidio, with travel time from Bayview being 32 minutes). Anthony and Brian are not included to ensure Jessica can be met for the full required duration at Golden Gate Park from 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM.\n\nThe schedule is as follows, with travel times accounted for between meetings:\n- Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (25 minutes), meet Richard from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM (60 minutes, within 11:00 AM to 12:45 PM).\n- Travel to Nob Hill (11 minutes), meet Elizabeth from 12:11 PM to 1:26 PM (75 minutes, within 11:45 AM to 6:30 PM).\n- Travel to Chinatown (6 minutes), meet Kenneth from 1:45 PM to 3:30 PM (105 minutes, within 1:45 PM to 7:30 PM; waiting from 1:32 PM to 1:45 PM).\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury (19 minutes), meet Ashley from 3:49 PM to 5:19 PM (90 minutes, within 3:00 PM to 8:30 PM; arrival at 3:49 PM, meeting starts immediately).\n- Travel to Union Square (19 minutes), meet Deborah from 5:38 PM to 6:38 PM (60 minutes, within 5:30 PM to 10:00 PM; arrival at 5:38 PM, meeting starts immediately).\n- Travel to Alamo Square (15 minutes), meet Kimberly from 6:53 PM to 7:38 PM (45 minutes, within 5:30 PM to 9:15 PM; arrival at 6:53 PM, meeting starts immediately).\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park (9 minutes), meet Jessica from 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM (105 minutes, within 8:00 PM to 9:45 PM; arrival at 7:47 PM, waiting from 7:47 PM to 8:00 PM).\n\nThis schedule meets all minimum duration requirements and respects travel constraints. Anthony (Pacific Heights, 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM) and Brian (North Beach, 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM) could not be included without conflicting with Jessica's fixed meeting time.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"11:00 AM\", \"end_time\": \"12:00 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"12:11 PM\", \"end_time\": \"1:26 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"1:45 PM\", \"end_time\": \"3:30 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"3:49 PM\", \"end_time\": \"5:19 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:38 PM\", \"end_time\": \"6:38 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"6:53 PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:38 PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"8:00 PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:45 PM\"}]}",
