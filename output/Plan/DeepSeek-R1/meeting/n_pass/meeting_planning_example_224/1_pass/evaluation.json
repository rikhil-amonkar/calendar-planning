    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nThe optimal schedule involves meeting all three friends while minimizing waiting time and ensuring all constraints are met. After evaluating various sequences, the best itinerary is to meet Melissa first at Golden Gate Park shortly after arrival, then meet Emily in the Richmond District starting later in the afternoon to reduce waiting time for Nancy, and finally meet Nancy at Presidio starting slightly after her availability begins to avoid idle time.\n\n- Start at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. Travel to Golden Gate Park (25 minutes) to meet Melissa from 9:25 AM to 9:40 AM (15 minutes, within her 8:30 AM to 8:00 PM availability).\n- Remain at Golden Gate Park until departing for the Richmond District. Travel to Richmond District (7 minutes) to arrive at 5:45 PM and meet Emily from 5:45 PM to 7:45 PM (120 minutes, within her 4:45 PM to 10:00 PM availability).\n- Travel from Richmond District to Presidio (7 minutes) to arrive at 7:52 PM and meet Nancy from 7:52 PM to 9:37 PM (105 minutes, within her 7:45 PM to 10:00 PM availability).\n\nThis schedule has minimal waiting time (only idle time at Golden Gate Park, which is not at a meeting location) and meets all minimum duration requirements.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Melissa\", \"start_time\": \"9:25AM\", \"end_time\": \"9:40AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Emily\", \"start_time\": \"5:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:45PM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Nancy\", \"start_time\": \"7:52PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:37PM\"}]}",
