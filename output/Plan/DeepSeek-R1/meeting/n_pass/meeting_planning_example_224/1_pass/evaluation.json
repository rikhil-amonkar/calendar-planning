To meet Emily for 120 minutes starting as late as possible to reduce waiting for Nancy, begin with Emily at Richmond District from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Afterward, travel to Golden Gate Park (9 minutes) to meet Melissa for the minimum 15 minutes from 7:09 PM to 7:24 PM. Then, travel to Presidio (11 minutes) and meet Nancy from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM for 105 minutes. This schedule ensures all meetings fit within the friends' availability windows and minimizes gaps, with only a 10-minute wait at Presidio before meeting Nancy.\n\nThe meeting schedule in the specified JSON format is:\n\n{\"meetings\": [{\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"5:00PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:00PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:09PM\", \"end_time\": \"7:24PM\"}, {\"day\": \"1\", \"start_time\": \"7:45PM\", \"end_time\": \"9:30PM\"}]}",
