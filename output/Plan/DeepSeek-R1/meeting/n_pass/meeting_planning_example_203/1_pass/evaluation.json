After evaluating various sequences and travel times, the best itinerary starts with Timothy at Pacific Heights from 10:00 AM to 11:15 AM (75 minutes), followed by David at Fisherman's Wharf from 11:28 AM to 11:43 AM (15 minutes), and ends with Robert at Mission District from 12:15 PM to 1:45 PM (90 minutes). This schedule ensures all minimum meeting times are met within the friends' availability windows, with only 10 minutes of waiting time before meeting Robert. Travel times are accounted for in the transitions, but only meeting actions are included in the output as per the JSON format requirement.\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Timothy\", \"start_time\": \"10:00 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:15 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"11:28 AM\", \"end_time\": \"11:43 AM\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"12:15 PM\", \"end_time\": \"01:45 PM\"}]}",
