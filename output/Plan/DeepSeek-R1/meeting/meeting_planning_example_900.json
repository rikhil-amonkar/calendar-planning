            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and their availability. Let's start by listing all the constraints and see how to fit everyone in.\n\nFirst, the user starts at Richmond District at 9:00 AM. The friends they want to meet are spread across different locations with varying time windows and required meeting durations. Let's list each person's details:\n\n- Matthew (The Castro): 4:30 PM to 8:00 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n- Rebecca (Nob Hill): 3:15 PM to 7:15 PM, 105 minutes.\n- Brian (Marina District): 2:15 PM to 10:00 PM, 30 minutes.\n- Emily (Pacific Heights): 11:15 AM to 7:45 PM, 15 minutes.\n- Karen (Haight-Ashbury): 11:45 AM to 5:30 PM, 30 minutes.\n- Stephanie (Mission District): 1:00 PM to 3:45 PM, 75 minutes.\n- James (Chinatown): 2:30 PM to 7:00 PM, 120 minutes.\n- Steven (Russian Hill): 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM, 30 minutes.\n- Elizabeth (Alamo Square): 1:00 PM to 5:15 PM, 120 minutes.\n- William (Bayview): 6:15 PM to 8:15 PM, 90 minutes.\n\nThe main challenge is to fit these meetings considering travel times between locations. Let's look for the longest required meetings first, as they are harder to schedule. Elizabeth needs 2 hours (120 minutes) and her window is 1 PM to 5:15 PM. Stephanie needs 75 minutes (1h15m) between 1 PM and 3:45 PM. James needs 2 hours from 2:30 PM to 7 PM. Rebecca needs 1h45m from 3:15 PM to 7:15 PM. William requires 1.5 hours from 6:15 PM. Matthew's meeting is later but needs 45 minutes. Others have shorter durations.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. The user is at Richmond District at 9 AM. The earliest meeting possible is Emily in Pacific Heights, available from 11:15 AM. But there's a gap between 9 AM and 11:15 AM. However, Karen in Haight-Ashbury is available from 11:45 AM. Wait, but maybe we can fit someone else first. Let's check the travel times from Richmond. To Pacific Heights, it's 10 minutes. So leaving Richmond at 11:05 AM would get to Emily by 11:15 AM. But Emily only needs 15 minutes. Then maybe after Emily, go to Karen. But Karen starts at 11:45 AM. Let's see:\n\nEmily's meeting: 11:15 AM start, ends at 11:30 AM. Then travel from Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury. The travel time is 11 minutes. So leaving at 11:30, arrive at 11:41. But Karen's available at 11:45. So wait until 11:45, meet her for 30 minutes until 12:15 PM. Then next?\n\nAfter Karen, perhaps go to Stephanie in Mission District. Karen is at Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Mission District is 11 minutes. So leaving Haight-Ashbury at 12:15 PM, arrive at Mission at 12:26 PM. But Stephanie is available from 1 PM. Hmm, that's a gap. Alternatively, maybe fit Elizabeth in Alamo Square first. But Elizabeth's window starts at 1 PM. Alternatively, let's see the order.\n\nAlternatively, after Karen, maybe go to Elizabeth. From Haight-Ashbury to Alamo Square is 5 minutes. So leaving at 12:15 PM, arrive at 12:20 PM. But Elizabeth's availability starts at 1 PM. So that's a 40-minute wait. Not ideal. Alternatively, maybe adjust the order.\n\nWait, Stephanie needs 75 minutes (1h15m) from 1 PM to 3:45 PM. If we start Stephanie at 1 PM, meet until 2:15 PM. Then travel time from Mission District to the next location. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with Emily first, then Karen, then Stephanie, then Elizabeth, then others. Let's try that.\n\nEmily in Pacific Heights from 11:15 AM (needs 15 min, ends 11:30). Then travel to Haight-Ashbury: 12 min (Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury is 11 minutes? Wait, looking at the travel distances: Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury is 11 minutes. So leaving at 11:30, arrive 11:41. Karen's available at 11:45. So meet Karen from 11:45 to 12:15 (30 min). Then travel to Mission District: Haight-Ashbury to Mission District is 11 minutes. Arrive at 12:26. But Stephanie is available at 1 PM. Wait until 1 PM, then meet her from 1 PM to 2:15 PM (75 min). Then from Mission District to Alamo Square: travel time is 11 minutes. Arrive at 2:26 PM. Elizabeth is available until 5:15 PM. She needs 120 minutes. So meeting from 2:26 PM to 4:26 PM. But Elizabeth's window is until 5:15 PM. That works. Then after Elizabeth, maybe head to Rebecca in Nob Hill. From Alamo Square to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. So leaving Alamo at 4:26 PM, arrive Nob Hill at 4:37 PM. Rebecca's available until 7:15 PM. She needs 105 minutes (1h45m). So 4:37 PM to 6:22 PM. Then from Nob Hill to The Castro to meet Matthew. Travel time from Nob Hill to The Castro is 17 minutes. So leave Nob Hill at 6:22, arrive Castro at 6:39 PM. Matthew's available until 8 PM. Need 45 minutes. So meet 6:39 PM to 7:24 PM. Then from Castro to Bayview to meet William. Travel time is 19 minutes. Arrive Bayview at 7:43 PM. William's available until 8:15 PM. He needs 90 minutes (1h30m). But starting at 7:43 PM, only 32 minutes left. Not enough. So William's meeting can't fit here.\n\nHmm. So this approach misses William. Let's see where else to fit William. He's at Bayview from 6:15 PM to 8:15 PM, needs 90 minutes. So need to be there by 6:45 PM at the latest (since 6:45 + 1h30m = 8:15). But how to get there. If the previous meetings run late, maybe we can't make it.\n\nAlternative plan: After meeting Elizabeth in Alamo Square until 4:26 PM, maybe instead of Rebecca, go to James in Chinatown. Let's check.\n\nFrom Alamo Square to Chinatown: travel time is 15 minutes. So leave at 4:26 PM, arrive 4:41 PM. James is available until 7 PM. Needs 120 minutes. So meet from 4:41 PM to 6:41 PM. Then travel to Bayview. Chinatown to Bayview is 20 minutes. Arrive at 6:41 + 20 = 7:01 PM. Meet William from 7:01 PM to 8:31 PM, but William's window ends at 8:15 PM. So adjust: start at 6:45 PM (since he's available until 8:15 PM). Wait, James would need to end by 6:45 PM to allow travel to Bayview (20 minutes) to arrive at 7:05 PM, then meet from 7:05 PM to 8:35 PM, which is beyond William's time. Alternatively, James could end earlier. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth (ends 4:26 PM), maybe go to Rebecca in Nob Hill. Rebecca needs 105 minutes. From Alamo Square to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. So arrive at 4:37 PM. Meet until 6:22 PM. Then from Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 minutes. Arrive at 6:41 PM. Meet William from 6:41 PM to 8:11 PM. But William's window is until 8:15 PM. That works, but need to check if William's start time is 6:15 PM. So 6:41 PM is after 6:15 PM. So possible. But William needs 90 minutes, so 6:41 PM to 8:11 PM. That's within his availability (ends at 8:15 PM). Then after that, go to Matthew in The Castro. From Bayview to Castro is 19 minutes. Arrive at 8:30 PM. But Matthew is available until 8 PM. So no. So Matthew's meeting would be missed.\n\nAlternatively, after Rebecca, maybe go to Matthew. From Nob Hill to Castro is 17 minutes. So leave Rebecca at 6:22 PM, arrive Castro at 6:39 PM. Meet until 7:24 PM (45 minutes). Then go to Bayview. Castro to Bayview is 19 minutes. Arrive at 7:43 PM. Meet William until 9:13 PM, but he's only available until 8:15 PM. So only from 7:43 PM to 8:15 PM (32 minutes), which isn't enough. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Maybe we need to prioritize William and Matthew. Let's see: William's meeting requires 90 minutes, starting by 6:45 PM. So to meet William, need to arrive by 6:45 PM and stay until 8:15 PM. But other meetings might conflict.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the earliest possible meetings. Starting at Richmond at 9 AM. The earliest available is Emily in Pacific Heights starting at 11:15 AM. So from 9 AM to 11:15 AM, maybe meet someone else? But no one else is available before that. Karen is available from 11:45 AM. So Emily first.\n\nAlternatively, after Emily, go to Karen. Then after Karen, maybe go to Alamo Square for Elizabeth. Let's see:\n\nEmily: 11:15-11:30 AM. Travel to Haight-Ashbury (11 minutes). Arrive 11:41 AM. Wait until 11:45 AM. Meet Karen until 12:15 PM. Then travel to Alamo Square (5 minutes). Arrive 12:20 PM. But Elizabeth is available from 1 PM. Wait until 1 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 1 PM to 3 PM (2 hours). Then travel to Mission District (Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 minutes). Arrive at 3:10 PM. Stephanie is available until 3:45 PM. Needs 75 minutes. But 3:10 PM to 3:45 PM is only 35 minutes. Not enough. So that's a problem. So this approach doesn't fit Stephanie.\n\nAlternative: After Elizabeth (1 PM to 3 PM), next could be Stephanie, but Stephanie's window ends at 3:45 PM. So leaving Alamo Square at 3 PM, travel to Mission District (10 minutes). Arrive 3:10 PM. Meet Stephanie from 3:10 PM to 4:25 PM (75 minutes). But Stephanie's availability ends at 3:45 PM. So this is impossible. So Stephanie must be scheduled before 3:45 PM. So Stephanie needs to start by 2:30 PM (75 minutes would end at 3:45 PM). But how to fit that.\n\nLet me try a different order. Start with Emily (11:15-11:30), then Karen (11:45-12:15), then Stephanie from 1 PM. Let's see:\n\nAfter Karen ends at 12:15 PM, travel from Haight-Ashbury to Mission District (11 minutes). Arrive 12:26 PM. But Stephanie's available at 1 PM. Wait until 1 PM. Meet from 1 PM to 2:15 PM. Then travel to Alamo Square (10 minutes). Arrive 2:25 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 2:25 PM to 4:25 PM. Then from Alamo Square to Rebecca in Nob Hill (11 minutes). Arrive 4:36 PM. Meet Rebecca until 6:21 PM (105 minutes). Then Rebecca ends at 6:21 PM. Then go to Matthew in Castro. Travel time from Nob Hill to Castro is 17 minutes. Arrive 6:38 PM. Meet until 7:23 PM (45 minutes). Then to Bayview (19 minutes). Arrive 7:42 PM. Meet William until 8:15 PM (33 minutes), which isn't enough. So William can't be fit here. Also, James in Chinatown needs 120 minutes, but hasn't been scheduled. So this approach misses James and William.\n\nHmm. Let's consider that James needs a 2-hour slot. His window is 2:30 PM to 7 PM. If we can fit him after Elizabeth. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Elizabeth from 2:25 PM to 4:25 PM, then go to James. From Alamo Square to Chinatown is 15 minutes. Arrive 4:40 PM. Meet until 6:40 PM. Then travel to Bayview (20 minutes). Arrive 7:00 PM. Meet William until 8:30 PM, but he's only there until 8:15 PM. So 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM is 75 minutes. Not enough. But maybe adjust James's time.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, go to Rebecca in Nob Hill. Meet Rebecca from 4:36 PM to 6:21 PM. Then to Chinatown (Nob Hill to Chinatown is 6 minutes). Arrive 6:27 PM. Meet James until 8:27 PM, but he's available until 7 PM. So not possible. So James needs to be scheduled earlier.\n\nAlternative idea: Fit James before Rebecca. Let's see. After Elizabeth ends at 4:25 PM, go to James in Chinatown. Meet from 4:40 PM to 6:40 PM. Then travel to Rebecca in Nob Hill (Chinatown to Nob Hill is 9 minutes). Arrive 6:49 PM. Rebecca's available until 7:15 PM. She needs 105 minutes (1h45m). So from 6:49 PM to 8:34 PM, but she's only available until 7:15 PM. So can't meet her. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe swap Rebecca and James. But Rebecca's window is 3:15 PM to 7:15 PM. If we schedule Rebecca after Elizabeth. Elizabeth ends at 4:25 PM, then go to Rebecca from 4:36 PM to 6:21 PM. Then James from 6:21 PM. But James is only available until 7 PM. So from 6:21 PM to 7 PM (39 minutes) isn't enough. So this isn't feasible.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try another approach. Maybe prioritize the longest meetings first: Elizabeth (120), Stephanie (75), James (120), Rebecca (105), William (90), and Matthew (45). Others are shorter.\n\nBut the time windows overlap. Let's see:\n\nElizabeth's window is 1 PM to 5:15 PM. Needs 2 hours. So best to schedule her from 1 PM to 3 PM. Then Stephanie's window is 1 PM to 3:45 PM, needs 75 minutes. So after Elizabeth, but Stephanie's window ends at 3:45 PM. So maybe:\n\nStart with Emily (11:15-11:30). Then Karen (11:45-12:15). Then travel to Mission District to meet Stephanie from 12:26 PM (but Stephanie's available from 1 PM). So meet Stephanie from 1 PM to 2:15 PM. Then go to Alamo Square (travel time 11 minutes, arrive 2:26 PM). Meet Elizabeth from 2:26 PM to 4:26 PM (120 minutes). Then go to Rebecca in Nob Hill (11 minutes travel, arrive 4:37 PM). Meet until 6:22 PM. Then to Matthew in Castro (17 minutes, arrive 6:39 PM). Meet until 7:24 PM. Then to Bayview (19 minutes, arrive 7:43 PM). Meet William until 8:15 PM (32 minutes). Not enough. So William is not possible here.\n\nAlternatively, after Rebecca (ends 6:22 PM), go to William. From Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 minutes. Arrive 6:41 PM. Meet until 8:11 PM. That's within William's window (ends 8:15 PM). Then after William, go to Matthew? From Bayview to Castro is 19 minutes. Arrive 8:30 PM, but Matthew's window ends at 8 PM. So no. So Matthew is missed.\n\nAlternatively, after Rebecca, go to Matthew. From Nob Hill to Castro (17 minutes). Meet from 6:39 PM to 7:24 PM. Then go to William (Castro to Bayview is 19 minutes. Arrive 7:43 PM. Meet until 8:15 PM (32 minutes). Not enough. So this way, William is not fully met.\n\nSo perhaps we need to drop one of the longer meetings to fit William. But the goal is to meet as many as possible. Let's see which meetings are required and which can be skipped.\n\nWait, all friends are desired, but the goal is to maximize the number met. Let's see which meetings can be fit.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nStart at Richmond (9 AM). Emily (11:15-11:30). Karen (11:45-12:15). Stephanie (1 PM-2:15 PM). Elizabeth (2:26-4:26 PM). James (4:41-6:41 PM). Then William (7:01-8:31 PM but adjust to 7:01-8:15 PM). That's 74 minutes, which is less than required. So James needs 120 minutes. If we schedule James from 4:41 PM to 6:41 PM, then William from 6:41 PM + travel time (20 minutes from Chinatown to Bayview). Arrive 7:01 PM. Meet until 8:15 PM (74 minutes). Not enough. So James can't be scheduled for full duration if we want William.\n\nAlternatively, if James is skipped, but that's a long meeting. Maybe better to skip someone else.\n\nAlternatively, meet James for part of his time. But the requirement is a minimum of 120 minutes, so can't do that.\n\nHmm. Let's try to find a schedule where we can fit in Elizabeth, Stephanie, Rebecca, James, William, and Matthew. Let's see.\n\nAlternative schedule:\n\nStart at Richmond (9 AM). Emily (11:15-11:30). Karen (11:45-12:15). Stephanie (1 PM-2:15 PM). Elizabeth (2:26-4:26 PM). Then Rebecca (4:37-6:22 PM). Then Matthew (6:39-7:24 PM). William (7:43-8:15 PM). But William's duration is only 32 minutes. Not enough. So this approach fails William.\n\nAnother angle: Let's try to fit William first. Since he's in Bayview from 6:15 PM, need to be there by 6:15 PM to start, and meet until 7:45 PM (90 minutes). But how to get there by 6:15 PM.\n\nSo after previous meetings, need to arrive at Bayview by 6:15 PM. Let's see:\n\nIf the last meeting before William is in a location close to Bayview. Mission District to Bayview is 14 minutes. So if the previous meeting ends by 6:01 PM, then arrive at 6:15 PM. So for example, if we're in Mission District until 6:00 PM, then travel to Bayview. But Stephanie's window ends at 3:45 PM, so can't be there. Alternatively, someone else's meeting in a location close to Bayview.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth in Alamo Square (ends 4:26 PM), travel to Bayview. Alamo Square to Bayview is 16 minutes. Arrive 4:42 PM. But William's window starts at 6:15 PM. So too early. Alternatively, after other meetings.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Let's try to outline a possible itinerary step by step.\n\n1. Start at Richmond at 9 AM.\n\nFirst available is Emily in Pacific Heights at 11:15 AM. Travel time is 10 minutes. So leave at 11:05 AM, arrive 11:15 AM. Meet until 11:30 AM.\n\n2. Next, go to Karen in Haight-Ashbury. Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury is 11 minutes. Leave at 11:30, arrive 11:41 AM. Wait until 11:45 AM. Meet until 12:15 PM.\n\n3. Then go to Stephanie in Mission District. Haight-Ashbury to Mission District is 11 minutes. Leave at 12:15 PM, arrive 12:26 PM. Stephanie's available from 1 PM. So wait until 1 PM. Meet from 1 PM to 2:15 PM.\n\n4. Next, go to Elizabeth in Alamo Square. Mission District to Alamo Square is 10 minutes. Leave at 2:15 PM, arrive 2:25 PM. Meet until 4:25 PM (2 hours).\n\n5. Then go to Rebecca in Nob Hill. Alamo Square to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. Arrive 4:36 PM. Meet until 6:21 PM (105 minutes).\n\n6. Next, go to Matthew in The Castro. Nob Hill to The Castro is 17 minutes. Leave at 6:21 PM, arrive 6:38 PM. Meet until 7:23 PM (45 minutes).\n\n7. Finally, go to William in Bayview. The Castro to Bayview is 19 minutes. Arrive 7:42 PM. Meet until 8:15 PM (33 minutes). Not enough. So William can't be met.\n\nSo this schedule includes Emily, Karen, Stephanie, Elizabeth, Rebecca, Matthew. Missing James, Steven, Brian, William.\n\nAlternatively, after Rebecca, go to James in Chinatown. From Nob Hill to Chinatown is 6 minutes. Arrive 6:27 PM. Meet until 8:27 PM, but James's window ends at 7 PM. So only until 7 PM. That's 33 minutes. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, go to James. From Alamo Square to Chinatown is 15 minutes. Arrive 4:40 PM. Meet until 6:40 PM. Then travel to Bayview (20 minutes). Arrive 7:00 PM. Meet William until 8:15 PM (75 minutes). Still not enough. But William needs 90 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if James is skipped, then after Rebecca, go to William. From Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 minutes. Arrive 6:21 PM + 19 = 6:40 PM. Meet until 8:10 PM (90 minutes). That works for William. Then from Bayview to Castro is 19 minutes. Arrive 8:29 PM, but Matthew's window ends at 8 PM. So can't meet Matthew.\n\nSo this way, William is met, but Matthew is missed.\n\nAnother possibility: Meet Steven in Russian Hill for 30 minutes. He's available from 2 PM. Let's see where to fit him.\n\nAfter meeting Elizabeth from 2:25 PM to 4:25 PM, then go to Steven in Russian Hill. Alamo Square to Russian Hill is 13 minutes. Arrive 4:38 PM. Meet until 5:08 PM. Then go to Rebecca in Nob Hill (Russian Hill to Nob Hill is 5 minutes). Arrive 5:13 PM. Meet until 7:00 PM (107 minutes, but Rebecca needs 105). That works. Then from Nob Hill to Matthew (17 minutes), arrive 7:17 PM. Meet until 8:02 PM. Then to Bayview (19 minutes), arrive 8:21 PM. William's window ends at 8:15 PM. So not enough.\n\nBut this adds Steven but may displace others.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth, go to Steven for a short meeting. Let's try:\n\nAfter Elizabeth (ends 4:25 PM), go to Russian Hill (13 minutes). Arrive 4:38 PM. Meet Steven until 5:08 PM. Then go to Rebecca in Nob Hill (5 minutes). Arrive 5:13 PM. Meet until 7:00 PM (105 minutes). Then Matthew until 7:45 PM. Then William until 8:15 PM. But travel from Castro to Bayview takes 19 minutes, arriving at 8:04 PM. Not enough.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe the optimal schedule is to meet as many as possible with their minimum times, even if some can't be fit. Let's try to find the maximum number.\n\nEmily: 15 min. Easy to fit.\n\nKaren: 30 min. Also easy.\n\nStephanie: 75 min. Need to fit her between 1 PM and 3:45 PM.\n\nElizabeth: 120 min. Between 1 PM and 5:15 PM.\n\nRebecca: 105 min. Between 3:15 PM and 7:15 PM.\n\nJames: 120 min. Between 2:30 PM and 7 PM.\n\nWilliam: 90 min. Between 6:15 PM and 8:15 PM.\n\nMatthew: 45 min. Between 4:30 PM and 8 PM.\n\nBrian: 30 min. Between 2:15 PM and 10 PM.\n\nSteven: 30 min. Between 2 PM and 8 PM.\n\nSo possible maximum is 10, but time and travel constraints make it impossible. Let's see.\n\nLet's try:\n\n9:00 AM - Richmond District.\n\n11:05 AM leave for Emily.\n\n11:15-11:30: Emily.\n\n11:30 leave for Karen (10 min travel to Haight-Ashbury, but wait until 11:45).\n\n11:45-12:15: Karen.\n\n12:15 leave for Stephanie in Mission District (11 min, arrive 12:26. Wait until 1 PM).\n\n1:00-2:15 PM: Stephanie.\n\n2:15 leave for Elizabeth in Alamo Square (10 min, arrive 2:25).\n\n2:25-4:25 PM: Elizabeth.\n\n4:25 leave for Rebecca in Nob Hill (11 min, arrive 4:36).\n\n4:36-6:21 PM: Rebecca.\n\n6:21 leave for Matthew in Castro (17 min, arrive 6:38).\n\n6:38-7:23 PM: Matthew.\n\n7:23 leave for William in Bayview (19 min, arrive 7:42).\n\n7:42-8:15 PM: William (33 min, not enough). So William not met.\n\nAlternatively, after Rebecca, go to William. From Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 min. Arrive 6:21 +19 =6:40. Meet until 8:10 PM (90 min). This works. But then Matthew is not met.\n\nSo in this case, meeting Emily, Karen, Stephanie, Elizabeth, Rebecca, William: 6 people. Missed are James, Brian, Steven, Matthew.\n\nAlternatively, try to fit Brian in Marina District (30 min). Available from 2:15 PM. After meeting Elizabeth, perhaps.\n\nElizabeth ends at 4:25 PM. Travel to Marina District: Alamo Square to Marina District is 15 minutes. Arrive 4:40 PM. Meet Brian until 5:10 PM. Then to Rebecca in Nob Hill (Marina to Nob Hill is 12 minutes. Arrive 5:22 PM. Meet until 7:07 PM (105 min). Then to William. Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 min. Arrive 7:26 PM. Meet until 8:56 PM, but William's window ends at 8:15. So meet until 8:15 PM (49 minutes. Not enough). So Brian is added, but William is missed.\n\nAlternatively, after Brian, go to Matthew. From Marina to Castro is 21 min. Arrive 5:10 +21=5:31 PM. Meet until 6:16 PM. Then to Rebecca. Castro to Nob Hill is 16 min. Arrive 6:32 PM. Meet until 8:17 PM (but Rebecca's window ends at 7:15 PM). So only until 7:15 PM (43 minutes. Not enough). So Rebecca can't be fully met.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's think of another approach.\n\nWhat if we start with Emily, Karen, then Elizabeth, Stephanie, James, Rebecca, William.\n\nEmily: 11:15-11:30.\n\nKaren: 11:45-12:15.\n\nElizabeth: 12:20-2:20 PM (Alamo Square, travel from Haight-Ashbury is 5 min. So arrive 12:20 PM. But Elizabeth's window starts at 1 PM. So can't start until 1 PM. So meet from 1 PM to 3 PM.\n\nThen Stephanie: 3:10 PM (travel from Alamo to Mission District is 10 min. Arrive 3:10, but Stephanie's window ends at 3:45 PM. So meet until 4:25 PM. But she's only available until 3:45 PM. So 35 minutes. Not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth (1 PM-3 PM), go to James in Chinatown. Alamo Square to Chinatown is 15 min. Arrive 3:15 PM. Meet until 5:15 PM. Then Rebecca in Nob Hill (6 min from Chinatown). Arrive 5:21 PM. Meet until 7:06 PM. Then William: 19 min to Bayview. Arrive 7:25 PM. Meet until 8:55 PM (window closes at 8:15 PM. So 50 minutes). Not enough.\n\nThis way, James and Rebecca are met, but William is partial.\n\nAnother angle: Fit James and Rebecca in overlapping times? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth (1 PM-3 PM), go to Rebecca. Alamo to Nob Hill is 11 min. Arrive 3:11 PM. Meet until 4:56 PM. Then James in Chinatown. Nob Hill to Chinatown is 6 min. Arrive 5:02 PM. Meet until 7:02 PM. Then William: 20 min to Bayview. Arrive 7:22 PM. Meet until 8:52 PM. Window closes at 8:15 PM. So 53 minutes. Not enough.\n\nThis approach gets James and Rebecca, but William isn't met fully.\n\nAt this point, I think the maximum number of friends that can be met with their minimum durations is around 6 or 7. Let's try to list the optimal schedule.\n\nThe itinerary would be:\n\n1. Emily (11:15-11:30)\n2. Karen (11:45-12:15)\n3. Stephanie (1:00-2:15)\n4. Elizabeth (2:25-4:25)\n5. Rebecca (4:36-6:21)\n6. Matthew (6:38-7:23)\n7. William (7:42-8:15) but insufficient.\n\nAlternatively, swap Matthew and William:\n\nAfter Rebecca (ends 6:21 PM), go to William (19 min to Bayview, arrive 6:40 PM). Meet until 8:10 PM (90 min). Then to Matthew (19 min to Castro, arrive 8:29 PM. Too late).\n\nSo William is met, but Matthew isn't.\n\nAlternatively, skip Matthew and meet William.\n\nSo the itinerary would be Emily, Karen, Stephanie, Elizabeth, Rebecca, William. That's 6 friends.\n\nBut wait, Brian is available from 2:15 PM to 10 PM. Can we fit him somewhere?\n\nAfter Elizabeth ends at 4:25 PM, go to Brian in Marina District (15 min travel). Arrive 4:40 PM. Meet until 5:10 PM (30 min). Then to Rebecca in Nob Hill (12 min, arrive 5:22 PM. Meet until 7:07 PM. Then to William (19 min, arrive 7:26 PM. Meet until 8:56 PM, but window ends at 8:15 PM. So meet until 8:15 PM (49 min). Not enough. But Brian is added.\n\nSo now, Emily, Karen, Stephanie, Elizabeth, Brian, Rebecca, William. 7 friends. But William's time is not fully met. However, the user wants to meet as many as possible. If partial meetings are not allowed, then we need to exclude William.\n\nBut the problem states \"minimum of X minutes\". So we must meet the minimum. Thus, William needs 90 minutes. So can't be included in this case.\n\nSo the correct schedule must include only those who can meet their minimum.\n\nLet's try to see if we can fit Steven in Russian Hill (30 min) somewhere.\n\nAfter Elizabeth (4:25 PM), go to Steven in Russian Hill (13 min). Arrive 4:38 PM. Meet until 5:08 PM. Then Rebecca (5:13 PM to 7:00 PM). Then William (7:00 PM +19 min travel. Meet until 8:15 PM. 75 minutes. Still not enough. So Steven can be added, but William is not.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth, go to Steven, then Rebecca, then Matthew. Miss William.\n\nSo this way, adding Steven but losing William.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Elizabeth, go to James (Alamo to Chinatown:15 min. Meet 4:40-6:40). Then William (6:40 +20 min. Meet until 8:00 PM. 80 minutes. Not enough).\n\nSo, after trying various combinations, it seems the maximum number of friends that can be met with their required minimum durations is 6: Emily, Karen, Stephanie, Elizabeth, Rebecca, and either Matthew or William, but not both.\n\nFor example:\n\nEmily: 11:15-11:30.\n\nKaren: 11:45-12:15.\n\nStephanie: 1:00-2:15.\n\nElizabeth: 2:25-4:25.\n\nRebecca: 4:36-6:21.\n\nMatthew: 6:38-7:23.\n\nWilliam: 7:42-8:15 (33 min, insufficient).\n\nAlternatively, replace Matthew with William:\n\nRebecca ends at 6:21 PM. Travel to Bayview (19 min). Meet William from 6:40-8:10 PM (90 min).\n\nThis meets Emily, Karen, Stephanie, Elizabeth, Rebecca, William (6 friends), with their full durations.\n\nBut Matthew is not met. But this is better in terms of number of friends met.\n\nAlternatively, include Brian instead of Matthew or William.\n\nAfter Elizabeth (4:25 PM), go to Brian (Marina District, 15 min. Arrive 4:40 PM. Meet until 5:10 PM. Then Rebecca: 5:10 PM +12 min travel. Arrive 5:22 PM. Meet until 7:07 PM. Then William: 7:07 +19 min =7:26 PM. Meet until 8:15 PM. 49 minutes. Not enough.\n\nSo Brian adds one more, but William is partial. So it's better to include William and skip Brian.\n\nSo the optimal schedule is:\n\nEmily (11:15-11:30), Karen (11:45-12:15), Stephanie (1:00-2:15), Elizabeth (2:25-4:25), Rebecca (4:36-6:21), William (6:40-8:10). This meets 6 friends with their required times.\n\nBut let's check travel times between each step.\n\n1. Richmond to Pacific Heights: 10 min. Leave at 11:05 AM, arrive 11:15 AM. Correct.\n\n2. Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury: 11 min. Leave 11:30, arrive 11:41 AM. Wait until 11:45 AM.\n\n3. Haight-Ashbury to Mission District: 11 min. Leave 12:15 PM, arrive 12:26 PM. Wait until 1 PM.\n\n4. Mission District to Alamo Square: 10 min. Leave 2:15 PM, arrive 2:25 PM.\n\n5. Alamo Square to Nob Hill: 11 min. Leave 4:25 PM, arrive 4:36 PM.\n\n6. Nob Hill to Bayview: 19 min. Leave 6:21 PM, arrive 6:40 PM. Meet William until 8:10 PM.\n\nYes, this works. So this schedule meets Emily, Karen, Stephanie, Elizabeth, Rebecca, and William, each fulfilling their minimum durations. Other friends like James, Brian, Steven, and Matthew are not included due to time constraints.\n\nBut wait, William's meeting ends at 8:10 PM, and his window is until 8:15 PM. So that's okay.\n\nAnother check: Does Rebecca's meeting end at 6:21 PM? Starts at 4:36 PM. 4:36 + 1h45m is 6:21 PM. Correct.\n\nYes, this seems to work.",
