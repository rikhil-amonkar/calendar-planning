            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco considering travel times and constraints. I need to start at Presidio at 9:00 AM. Let's list out all the people and their availability first.\n\nJeffrey is at Fisherman's Wharf from 10:15 AM to 1:00 PM. I need to meet him for at least 90 minutes. That's a big chunk. Ronald is at Alamo Square from 7:45 AM to 2:45 PM, needing 120 minutes. Jason at Financial District from 10:45 AM to 4 PM, 105 minutes. Melissa at Union Square from 5:45 PM to 6:15 PM, only 15 minutes. Elizabeth at Sunset District from 2:45 PM to 5:30 PM, 105 minutes. Margaret at Embarcadero from 1:15 PM to 7 PM, 90 minutes. George at Golden Gate Park from 7 PM to 10 PM, 75 minutes. Richard in Chinatown from 9:30 AM to 9 PM, 15 minutes. Laura in Richmond District from 9:45 AM to 6 PM, 60 minutes.\n\nFirst, since I start at Presidio at 9 AM, the earliest I can leave is 9:00. Let's see the travel times from Presidio to others. The closest seems to be Richmond District (7 minutes), Golden Gate Park (12), Sunset (15), etc.\n\nLaura is in Richmond District from 9:45 AM. Presidio to Richmond is 7 minutes. So earliest arrival is 9:07 AM. But Laura is available from 9:45. So maybe meet Laura first. Wait, if I leave Presidio at 9:00, arrive at Richmond at 9:07, but Laura isn't available until 9:45. That's a 38-minute wait. Maybe better to go somewhere else first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Richard in Chinatown. Richard is available from 9:30 AM. Presidio to Chinatown is 21 minutes. So leaving at 9:00, arrive at 9:21. But Richard is available from 9:30. Wait, that's only 9 minutes early. So maybe start meeting Richard at 9:30 for 15 minutes, ending at 9:45. Then go somewhere else. But after that, where to next?\n\nBut let's check other options. Ronald is at Alamo Square until 2:45 PM. Needs 120 minutes. If I can meet him early, that's good. Presidio to Alamo Square is 19 minutes. So leave at 9:00, arrive at 9:19. Ronald is available from 7:45, so start at 9:19, meet until 11:19 (120 minutes). But then Jeffrey's window is 10:15 AM to 1 PM. But meeting Ronald from 9:19 to 11:19 would conflict with Jeffrey's 10:15 start. So maybe not possible unless I split Ronald's time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Jeffrey first. Let's see. Presidio to Fisherman's Wharf is 19 minutes. Arrive at 9:19. But Jeffrey is only available from 10:15. So wait until 10:15. That's a long wait. So maybe better to do something else first.\n\nAnother option: Laura in Richmond District. She's available from 9:45 AM. Presidio to Richmond is 7 minutes. So leave at 9:00, arrive at 9:07. Wait until 9:45, meet her from 9:45 to 10:45 (60 minutes). Then go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Jeffrey. Travel time from Richmond to Fisherman's Wharf is 18 minutes. So leave Richmond at 10:45, arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 11:03. But Jeffrey's available until 1 PM. So meet from 11:03 to 12:33 (90 minutes). That works. Then after that, go to Ronald at Alamo Square. Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square is 21 minutes. Leave at 12:33, arrive at 12:54. Ronald's available until 2:45. So meet from 12:54 to 2:54 (120 minutes). That ends at 2:54. Then next, Elizabeth in Sunset District from 2:45 PM. So need to get there. Alamo Square to Sunset is 16 minutes. Leave at 2:54, arrive at 3:10. Elizabeth is available until 5:30. So meet from 3:10 to 4:55 (105 minutes). Then go to Margaret at Embarcadero. Sunset to Embarcadero is 30 minutes. Leave at 4:55, arrive at 5:25. Margaret is there until 7 PM. Need 90 minutes, but Melissa is at Union Square from 5:45 to 6:15. So perhaps meet Margaret from 5:25 to 6:55, but that's 90 minutes. However, Melissa's window is tight. Let's see: after Margaret, if I leave Embarcadero at 6:55, travel to Union Square is 10 minutes (Embarcadero to Union Square is 10). Arrive at 7:05, but Melissa's window ends at 6:15 PM. So that's too late. So need to adjust. Maybe meet Margaret from 5:25 to 6:55 conflicts with Melissa. So perhaps need to meet Melissa first.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, go to Margaret. Let's think: Elizabeth ends at 4:55. Then travel to Embarcadero (30 mins). Arrive at 5:25. Meet Margaret from 5:25 to 6:55. Then Melissa is at Union Square from 5:45-6:15. So during Margaret's meeting, could we break to meet Melissa? But travel time from Embarcadero to Union Square is 10 minutes. So leave Margaret at 6:15-10 mins (assuming need to be at Union Square by 6:15). So leave Margaret at 6:05, arrive Union Square at 6:15, meet Melissa until 6:15 (exactly), but she needs 15 mins. So that's impossible. Hmm.\n\nAlternative plan: After Elizabeth, go to Union Square first. From Sunset to Union Square is 30 minutes. Leave at 4:55, arrive at 5:25. Melissa is available from 5:45. Wait until 5:45, meet her from 5:45 to 6:00. Then go to Embarcadero. Union Square to Embarcadero is 10 minutes. Arrive at 6:10. Margaret is there until 7:00. Meet from 6:10 to 7:40, but she's only available until 7:00. So only 50 minutes. Not enough for 90. Not possible. So this approach won't work.\n\nAlternative idea: After Elizabeth, go to Margaret, but leave early enough to meet Melissa. For example, meet Margaret from 5:25 to 6:25 (60 mins), then leave to meet Melissa. Travel time from Embarcadero to Union Square is 10 mins. So leave at 6:25, arrive at 6:35. But Melissa's window is until 6:15. So no. That's too late.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Melissa after Margaret. But Melissa's window is 5:45-6:15. So if we can get to Union Square by 6:15, but Margaret's meeting would need to end by 6:05 (travel 10 mins). So if Margaret is met from say 4:00 to 5:30 (90 mins), but how does that fit?\n\nWait, let's backtrack. Let's see:\n\nCurrent plan:\n\nLaura: 9:45-10:45\n\nJeffrey: 11:03-12:33\n\nRonald: 12:54-14:54 (2:54 PM)\n\nElizabeth: 15:10-16:55 (3:10 PM to 4:55 PM)\n\nThen need to fit Margaret (1:15 PM to 7 PM) and Melissa (5:45-6:15).\n\nBut after Elizabeth at 4:55 PM, go to Embarcadero (30 mins) arriving at 5:25 PM. Meet Margaret from 5:25-6:55, but that's 90 mins. Then Melissa's time is 5:45-6:15. So overlapping. So during Margaret's meeting, can I leave to meet Melissa?\n\nBut traveling from Embarcadero to Union Square takes 10 mins. So leave Margaret at 5:45 (her start time is 1:15 PM), but in this plan, we're meeting Margaret from 5:25-6:55. So at 5:45, leave Embarcadero, arrive Union Square at 5:55. Melissa's window ends at 6:15. So meet from 5:55-6:10 (15 mins). Then back to Embarcadero? But Margaret's meeting would have been interrupted. So maybe not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe adjust the order. Let's see if we can meet Margaret earlier. For example, after Ronald at 2:54 PM, perhaps go to Margaret first before Elizabeth. But Elizabeth is available from 2:45 PM. So Ronald ends at 2:54 PM. Travel to Embarcadero from Alamo Square takes 16 mins. Arrive at 3:10 PM. Meet Margaret from 3:10 to 4:40 (90 mins). Then go to Elizabeth at Sunset District. Embarcadero to Sunset is 30 mins. Arrive at 5:10 PM. Elizabeth is available until 5:30. So meet from 5:10 to 5:30 (20 mins), which is less than the required 105. Not enough.\n\nHmm. So that's not possible. Alternatively, after Ronald, go to Elizabeth first. Alamo Square to Sunset is 16 mins. Arrive at 3:10 PM. Meet Elizabeth until 4:55 (105 mins). Then go to Margaret. Sunset to Embarcadero is 30 mins. Arrive at 5:25 PM. Meet until 6:55 (90 mins). Then Melissa's 5:45-6:15. So during Margaret's meeting, leave at 6:05 to go to Union Square (10 mins), arrive 6:15. But Melissa's time ends at 6:15, so meet her exactly at 6:15 for 0 minutes. No good.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, go to Union Square first. Sunset to Union Square is 30 mins. Arrive at 5:25. Wait until 5:45, meet Melissa until 6:00. Then go to Embarcadero (10 mins), arrive 6:10. Meet Margaret until 7:00 (50 mins). Not enough. So that's 50, but needs 90.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe we have to skip one of them. Let's see which ones are mandatory. The user wants to meet as many as possible. So maybe Melissa's 15 minutes is easier to fit in.\n\nAnother angle: Let's check if George can be met. He's at Golden Gate Park from 7 PM. Needs 75 mins. So 7:00-8:15 PM. After Margaret's meeting ends at 6:55, go to Golden Gate Park. Embarcadero to Golden Gate Park is 25 mins. Arrive at 7:20. Meet until 8:35 (75 mins), but George is there until 10 PM. So possible.\n\nBut let's see how to fit everyone else.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nStart at Presidio 9:00 AM.\n\nFirst, meet Laura in Richmond District. Presidio to Richmond is 7 mins. Arrive 9:07. Laura available from 9:45. Wait until 9:45, meet 9:45-10:45 (60 mins).\n\nThen to Fisherman's Wharf: 18 mins. Arrive 11:03. Meet Jeffrey 11:03-12:33 (90 mins).\n\nThen to Alamo Square: 21 mins. Arrive 12:54. Meet Ronald 12:54-14:54 (120 mins).\n\nThen to Sunset District: Alamo to Sunset is 16 mins. Arrive 15:10. Meet Elizabeth 15:10-16:55 (105 mins).\n\nThen to Embarcadero: 30 mins. Arrive 17:25. Meet Margaret 17:25-18:55 (90 mins). Then to Union Square: 10 mins. Arrive 19:05, but Melissa's window is 5:45-6:15 PM. So too late. So Melissa can't be met here.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, go to Union Square first. Sunset to Union Square 30 mins. Arrive 16:55 +30=17:25. Melissa is available until 6:15 PM (18:15 in 24h). 17:25 is 5:25 PM. Wait until 17:45 (5:45 PM), meet until 18:00 (6:00 PM). Then to Embarcadero: 10 mins. Arrive 18:10. Meet Margaret until 19:40 (needs 90), but she's available until 19:00 (7 PM). So meet from 18:10-19:00 (50 mins). Not enough. So can't meet Margaret fully.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe we have to sacrifice meeting Melissa to meet Margaret and George. Let's see:\n\nIf we proceed with the original plan:\n\nLaura: 9:45-10:45\n\nJeffrey: 11:03-12:33\n\nRonald: 12:54-14:54\n\nElizabeth:15:10-16:55\n\nMargaret:17:25-18:55 (Embarcadero)\n\nThen George: Golden Gate Park at 19:00. Travel from Embarcadero to Golden Gate Park is 25 mins. Arrive 19:20. Meet 19:20-20:35 (75 mins). That works.\n\nBut Melissa is missed. Alternatively, can we fit Melissa in between?\n\nAfter Margaret ends at 18:55 (6:55 PM), go to Union Square: 10 mins, arrive 19:05 (7:05 PM). Melissa's window is until 6:15 PM. Too late. So Melissa can't be met unless we adjust the schedule.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe meet Richard in Chinatown for 15 mins early on. Let's see.\n\nAfter Laura at 10:45, go to Chinatown. Richmond to Chinatown is 20 mins. So leave at 10:45, arrive 11:05. Meet Richard from 11:05-11:20. Then go to Fisherman's Wharf (Chinatown to Fisherman's Wharf is 8 mins. Arrive 11:28. Then meet Jeffrey from 11:28-12:58 (90 mins). Then to Alamo Square (21 mins. Arrive 13:19. Meet Ronald until 15:19 (120 mins). Then to Sunset District (16 mins. Arrive 15:35. Meet Elizabeth until 17:20 (105 mins). Then to Embarcadero (30 mins. Arrive 17:50. Meet Margaret until 19:20 (90 mins). Then to Golden Gate Park (25 mins. Arrive 19:45. Meet George until 21:00 (75 mins). But in this case, Ronald's meeting would end at 3:19 PM, which is within his availability (until 2:45 PM). Wait, no, 2:45 PM is the end time for Ronald. So meeting Ronald from 13:19 to 15:19 would be after his availability ends at 14:45 (2:45 PM). So that's a problem. So can't do that.\n\nSo back to original plan without Richard. Let's see if Richard can be met early.\n\nAfter Presidio, first meet Richard in Chinatown. Presidio to Chinatown is 21 mins. Arrive at 9:21. Richard available from 9:30. Wait until 9:30, meet 9:30-9:45. Then go to Laura in Richmond. Chinatown to Richmond is 20 mins. Arrive 10:05. Laura available from 9:45, so meet from 10:05-11:05. Then to Fisherman's Wharf: Richmond to Fisherman's is 18 mins. Arrive 11:23. Meet Jeffrey from 11:23-12:53 (90). Then to Alamo Square (21 mins. Arrive 13:14. Meet Ronald until 15:14 (120 mins). But Ronald's available until 14:45 (2:45 PM). So this would end at 3:14 PM, which is beyond his availability. So invalid.\n\nAlternative: Meet Ronald first. Presidio to Alamo Square is 19 mins. Arrive 9:19. Meet from 9:19-11:19 (120 mins). Then to Fisherman's Wharf (19 mins. Arrive 11:38. Jeffrey available until 1 PM. Meet from 11:38-1:08 (90 mins). But Jeffrey's window ends at 1:00 PM. So can't go beyond 1 PM. So adjust to 11:38-1:00 (82 mins). Not enough. So need to start earlier.\n\nWait, if I meet Ronald first, from 9:19-11:19, then go to Fisherman's Wharf (19 mins), arrive 11:38. Jeffrey's available until 1 PM. Meet from 11:38-1:00 (82 mins). Not 90. So not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, meet Jeffrey first, but he's available from 10:15. Let's try:\n\nStart at Presidio at 9:00. Go to Fisherman's Wharf (19 mins), arrive 9:19. Jeffrey is available from 10:15. So wait until 10:15. Meet from 10:15-11:45 (90 mins). Then to Alamo Square (21 mins). Arrive 12:06. Meet Ronald until 14:06 (120 mins), but Ronald's available until 14:45 (2:45 PM). So that's okay. Then to Sunset District (16 mins. Arrive 14:22. Elizabeth available from 14:45 (2:45 PM). So wait until 14:45, meet until 16:30 (105 mins). Then to Embarcadero (30 mins. Arrive 17:00. Meet Margaret until 18:30 (90 mins). Then to Union Square (10 mins. Arrive 18:40. Melissa's available until 18:15 (6:15 PM). Too late. Can't meet her. Then to Golden Gate Park (22 mins from Union Square? Wait, Golden Gate Park's travel time from Union Square is 22 mins. Arrive 19:02. George is available from 19:00. Meet from 19:02-20:17 (75 mins). That works.\n\nThis plan includes Jeffrey, Ronald, Elizabeth, Margaret, George. Plus Laura and Richard?\n\nIn this plan, Laura is not met. Because after Jeffrey and Ronald, there's no time for her. So maybe need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Ronald until 14:06, then go to Laura in Richmond. Alamo Square to Richmond is 11 mins. Arrive 14:17. Laura is available until 18:00 (6 PM). Meet from 14:17-15:17 (60 mins). Then to Elizabeth in Sunset District. Richmond to Sunset is 11 mins. Arrive 15:28. Elizabeth available from 14:45 (2:45 PM). So meet from 15:28-17:13 (105 mins). Then to Embarcadero (30 mins. Arrive 17:43. Meet Margaret until 19:13 (90 mins), but she's available until 19:00 (7 PM). So meet until 19:00, which is 77 mins. Not enough. Then to Golden Gate Park (25 mins. Arrive 19:25. Meet George until 20:40 (75 mins). But Margaret's meeting would only be 77 mins, which is less than the required 90. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. Let's see if we can fit Laura in another way. Maybe between Ronald and Elizabeth.\n\nAfter Ronald ends at 14:06 (2:06 PM), go to Laura in Richmond (Alamo to Richmond is 11 mins. Arrive 14:17. Meet until 15:17. Then to Sunset District (11 mins from Richmond to Sunset. Arrive 15:28. Meet Elizabeth until 17:13. Then to Embarcadero (30 mins. Arrive 17:43. Meet Margaret until 19:13 (but she's there until 19:00). So 17:43-19:00 is 77 mins. Close but not 90. Then George from 19:25 to 20:40.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, go to Margaret. Elizabeth ends at 17:13. Travel to Embarcadero takes 30 mins. Arrive 17:43. Meet until 19:13 (90 mins). But she's there until 19:00. So 17:43-19:00 is 77 mins. Not enough. So can't meet Margaret for 90.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the time with Margaret. Maybe meet her earlier.\n\nLet's try this schedule:\n\nPresidio to Fisherman's Wharf: 19 mins. Arrive 9:19. Wait until 10:15, meet Jeffrey 10:15-11:45 (90).\n\nThen to Alamo Square: 21 mins. Arrive 12:06. Meet Ronald 12:06-14:06 (120).\n\nThen to Laura in Richmond: Alamo to Richmond is 11 mins. Arrive 14:17. Meet 14:17-15:17 (60).\n\nThen to Sunset District: 11 mins. Arrive 15:28. Meet Elizabeth 15:28-17:13 (105).\n\nThen to Embarcadero: 30 mins. Arrive 17:43. Meet Margaret until 19:00 (77 mins).\n\nBut she needs 90. So not possible. Alternatively, skip Margaret and meet Melissa and George.\n\nAfter Elizabeth, go to Union Square. Sunset to Union Square is 30 mins. Arrive 17:43. Wait until 17:45 (5:45 PM). Meet Melissa 17:45-18:00. Then to Golden Gate Park. Union Square to Golden Gate Park is 22 mins. Arrive 18:22. George is there from 19:00. Wait until 19:00, meet until 20:15 (75 mins). But that skips Margaret.\n\nSo in this case, meetings would be Jeffrey, Ronald, Laura, Elizabeth, Melissa, George. That's six people. Plus Richard?\n\nBut Richard hasn't been met yet. So maybe fit him in early.\n\nAfter meeting Laura in Richmond, before going to Alamo Square, but that's not possible. Alternatively, after Presidio, first meet Richard.\n\nPresidio to Chinatown: 21 mins. Arrive 9:21. Meet Richard 9:30-9:45. Then to Laura in Richmond: Chinatown to Richmond is 20 mins. Arrive 10:05. Meet Laura 10:05-11:05. Then to Fisherman's Wharf: 18 mins. Arrive 11:23. Jeffrey available until 1 PM. Meet 11:23-12:53 (90). Then to Alamo Square: 21 mins. Arrive 13:14. Meet Ronald until 15:14. But Ronald's available until 14:45. So this ends at 3:14 PM, which is beyond his availability. So invalid.\n\nAlternative, meet Ronald earlier. Presidio to Alamo Square: 19 mins. Arrive 9:19. Meet Ronald 9:19-11:19. Then to Chinatown: Alamo to Chinatown is 15 mins. Arrive 11:34. Meet Richard 11:34-11:49. Then to Fisherman's Wharf: 8 mins. Arrive 11:57. Meet Jeffrey until 1:00 PM (63 mins). Not enough.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the optimal schedule is to meet as many as possible, prioritizing those with tighter windows. Melissa's window is very tight (5:45-6:15), so hard to fit. George is available later. Let's try to fit the following people: Laura, Jeffrey, Ronald, Elizabeth, Margaret, George. That's six. Richard and Melissa would be hard.\n\nOriginal plan:\n\n9:00 Presidio\n\n9:07 arrive Richmond (wait until 9:45)\n\n9:45-10:45 meet Laura\n\n10:45 leave to Fisherman's Wharf (18 mins)\n\n11:03-12:33 meet Jeffrey\n\n12:33 leave to Alamo Square (21 mins)\n\n12:54-14:54 meet Ronald\n\n14:54 leave to Sunset (16 mins)\n\n15:10-16:55 meet Elizabeth\n\n16:55 leave to Embarcadero (30 mins)\n\n17:25-18:55 meet Margaret\n\n18:55 leave to Golden Gate Park (25 mins)\n\n19:20-20:35 meet George\n\nThis way, meet Laura, Jeffrey, Ronald, Elizabeth, Margaret, George. Six people. Richard and Melissa are skipped. But can we fit Richard?\n\nAfter meeting Laura at 10:45, go to Chinatown (Richmond to Chinatown is 20 mins. Arrive 11:05. Meet Richard 11:05-11:20. Then to Fisherman's Wharf (8 mins. Arrive 11:28. Meet Jeffrey 11:28-12:58. Then Ronald 13:19-15:19. But Ronald's available until 14:45. So 15:19 is past 2:45 PM. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Jeffrey, go to Richard. But Jeffrey ends at 12:33. Fisherman's Wharf to Chinatown is 12 mins. Arrive 12:45. Meet Richard 12:45-13:00. Then to Alamo Square (15 mins. Arrive 13:15. Meet Ronald until 15:15. Again, past his availability.\n\nSo it's challenging. Therefore, the initial plan with six people might be the best possible.",
