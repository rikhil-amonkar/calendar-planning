            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the order in which to meet all these friends while considering their availability and travel times. Let me start by listing out all the people, their locations, availability, and the minimum time required for each meeting.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\n- Arrive at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM.\n- Emily: Russian Hill, 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM, needs 105 minutes (1h45m).\n- Mark: Presidio, 2:45 PM to 7:30 PM, 60 minutes.\n- Deborah: Chinatown, 7:30 AM to 3:30 PM, 45 minutes.\n- Margaret: Sunset District, 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM, 60 minutes.\n- George: The Castro, 7:30 AM to 2:15 PM, 60 minutes.\n- Andrew: Embarcadero, 8:15 PM to 10:00 PM, 75 minutes.\n- Steven: Golden Gate Park, 11:15 AM to 9:15 PM, 105 minutes.\n\nThe goal is to meet as many as possible, optimizing the schedule. Let's see who can fit where.\n\nStarting at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM. The first possible meetings could be with Deborah in Chinatown, George in The Castro, or Steven in Golden Gate Park. Let's check their availability:\n\n- George is available until 2:15 PM. The Castro is 8 minutes from Alamo Square. So leaving at 9:00, arrival at 9:08. If I meet George from 9:08 to 10:08 (60 minutes), then leave. But Steven is available from 11:15 AM. Alternatively, maybe meet Steven first.\n\nSteven's at Golden Gate Park from 11:15 AM to 9:15 PM. To meet him for 105 minutes (1h45m), he needs a block. Since he's available from 11:15, maybe start at 11:15 and end at 1:00 PM. But wait, Emily's window is 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM, and she needs 105 minutes. That would overlap. So maybe need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps start with George in The Castro. Let's see:\n\nAlamo Square to The Castro is 8 minutes. So leave at 9:00, arrive 9:08. Meet George from 9:08 to 10:08 (60 minutes). Then need to go somewhere else next. Next, maybe Steven in Golden Gate Park. The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes (from The Castro to Golden Gate Park: travel time is 11 minutes according to the table). So leaving at 10:08, arrive at 10:19. Steven's available from 11:15 AM. So wait until 11:15? That's 10:19 to 11:15 is about 56 minutes, which is a lot of downtime. Not ideal. Alternatively, maybe after meeting George, go to another location that's closer and fits in the time before Steven's availability.\n\nAlternatively, after George, maybe go to Deborah in Chinatown. The Castro to Chinatown is 20 minutes. So leaving at 10:08, arrive at 10:28. Deborah is available until 3:30 PM. Meeting her for 45 minutes: 10:28 to 11:13. Then from Chinatown to Golden Gate Park? Let's check the travel time. Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes. So leaving at 11:13, arrive at 11:36. Steven's available at 11:15, so starting at 11:36 would work. But Steven needs 105 minutes, so 11:36 to 1:21 PM. But Emily is in Russian Hill from 12:15 to 2:15. That would overlap. So meeting Steven until 1:21 PM would conflict with Emily's meeting time. So maybe this isn't the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with Steven first. Let's see:\n\nAlamo Square to Golden Gate Park is 9 minutes. Arrive at 9:09 AM. But Steven isn't available until 11:15 AM. So that's too early. So can't meet him until 11:15. So maybe start with Deborah in Chinatown. Alamo Square to Chinatown is 16 minutes. Leaving at 9:00, arrive at 9:16. Deborah is available from 7:30 AM to 3:30 PM. Meet her for 45 minutes: 9:16 to 10:01. Then travel to Golden Gate Park. Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes. So leave at 10:01, arrive at 10:24. Steven's available from 11:15, so we need to wait until 11:15. That's 51 minutes of waiting. Not great. Alternatively, after Deborah, go to another person.\n\nWait, George is available until 2:15 PM. Maybe after Deborah, go to George. From Chinatown to The Castro is 22 minutes (Chinatown to The Castro: 22). So leave at 10:01, arrive at 10:23. Meet George from 10:23 to 11:23 (60 minutes). Then from The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. Arrive at 11:34. Steven is available from 11:15, so start at 11:34. Meet until 1:19 PM (105 minutes). Then, Emily's window starts at 12:15 PM. But during the Steven meeting, Emily's time starts. So overlapping. So this might not work. Alternatively, adjust Steven's meeting to end before Emily's start time plus travel time.\n\nWait, Emily is at Russian Hill from 12:15 PM. To meet her for 105 minutes, the meeting would need to start by 12:15 PM and end at 2:00 PM. Because 12:15 + 1h45m = 2:00 PM. But she is available until 2:15 PM. So maybe 12:15 to 2:00 PM. Then, after that, go to Mark at Presidio.\n\nBut how to fit Steven's 105 minutes before Emily's meeting, considering travel times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps schedule Steven after Emily, but Steven is available until 9:15 PM. Let's think.\n\nAnother approach: The user starts at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM. Let's see possible sequences.\n\nOption 1:\n\n9:00 AM: Start at Alamo Square.\n\nFirst, meet George in The Castro (8 mins travel, arrive 9:08). Meet from 9:08 to 10:08 (60m).\n\nThen, go to Golden Gate Park (The Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11 mins. Arrive 10:19). But Steven is available from 11:15 AM. So wait until 11:15. That's 10:19 to 11:15 is 56 minutes. Not ideal. Then meet Steven from 11:15 to 1:00 PM (105m). Then leave Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill: Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill is 19 minutes. So leave at 1:00 PM, arrive 1:19 PM. But Emily's window is 12:15 to 2:15 PM. The latest we can start meeting Emily is 12:15 PM, but if we arrive at 1:19 PM, that's after the start. So we need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, after George, go to another location. Maybe Deborah in Chinatown. From The Castro to Chinatown is 20 minutes. So arrive at 10:28. Meet Deborah until 11:13 (45m). Then go to Golden Gate Park (Chinatown to GGP:23 mins, arrive 11:36). Meet Steven from 11:36 to 1:21 PM. Then go to Emily in Russian Hill. GGP to Russian Hill is 19 mins. So leave at 1:21 PM, arrive at 1:40 PM. But Emily's availability is until 2:15 PM. So start at 1:40 PM, meet until 2:15 PM (35 minutes), which is less than the required 105. Not possible. So this path doesn't work.\n\nOption 2:\n\nStart with Deborah. Alamo Square to Chinatown: 16 mins. Arrive 9:16. Meet until 10:01. Then to Golden Gate Park (23 mins, arrive 10:24). Wait until 11:15 to meet Steven (10:24-11:15 is 51m wait). Meet Steven 11:15-1:00 PM. Then to Russian Hill (GGP to Russian Hill is 19 mins. Arrive 1:19 PM. Meet Emily from 1:19 PM to 2:15 PM (56 mins), which is less than 105. Not enough. So this path also fails.\n\nOption 3:\n\nMeet Steven first. Since he's available starting 11:15 AM. Let's see: Start at Alamo Square, leave at 9:00 AM. Need to be at Golden Gate Park by 11:15. But what to do between 9:00 and 11:15. Maybe meet George or Deborah.\n\nFor example:\n\nAlamo Square to The Castro (8 mins), arrive 9:08. Meet George until 10:08. Then travel to Golden Gate Park (11 mins), arrive 10:19. Wait until 11:15 (56 mins). Then meet Steven from 11:15 to 1:00 PM. Then travel to Emily's location (GGP to Russian Hill: 19 mins, arrive 1:19 PM). Meet Emily from 1:19 to 2:15 PM (56 mins), which is too short. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven from 11:15 to 1:00 PM, can we leave earlier to meet Emily? If we leave Steven early. But Steven needs 105 minutes. So meeting from 11:15 to 1:00 PM is exactly 1h45m. Then, leaving at 1:00 PM, travel to Russian Hill (19 mins), arrive 1:19 PM. But Emily is available until 2:15 PM. So 1:19 to 2:15 is 56 minutes. Not enough. So can't meet Emily for 105 minutes here.\n\nAlternative idea: Meet Emily first. Let's see. The user starts at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM. To meet Emily in Russian Hill from 12:15 PM onwards. The earliest we can start Emily's meeting is 12:15 PM. Let's see if we can fit other meetings before that.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart at 9:00 AM. Go to Golden Gate Park (9 mins travel, arrive 9:09 AM). But Steven is available from 11:15 AM. So need to wait until 11:15. So maybe meet someone else first.\n\nAlternatively, go to Deborah in Chinatown. Arrive at 9:16 AM, meet until 10:01 AM. Then go to Golden Gate Park (23 mins, arrive 10:24). Wait until 11:15 AM. Meet Steven 11:15 AM to 1:00 PM. Then go to Emily's. GGP to Russian Hill is 19 mins. Arrive 1:19 PM. Meet Emily from 1:19 PM to 2:15 PM (56 mins). Not enough. Alternatively, maybe split Steven's meeting.\n\nWait, Steven's available until 9:15 PM. Maybe meet him later. Let's consider:\n\nMaybe schedule Emily first. Let's see:\n\nEmily is available 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM. Need 105 minutes. So start at 12:15 PM, meet until 2:00 PM. Then, after that, go to Mark in Presidio (available from 2:45 PM). So travel time from Russian Hill to Presidio is 14 mins (Russian Hill to Presidio is 14). So leave Emily at 2:00 PM, arrive Presidio at 2:14 PM. But Mark is available from 2:45 PM. So we have to wait until 2:45 PM. Wait time 31 minutes. Then meet Mark from 2:45 PM to 3:45 PM (60 mins). Then after that, perhaps go to Steven.\n\nAfter Mark, travel from Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 12 mins. Arrive 3:57 PM. Meet Steven from 3:57 PM to 5:42 PM (105 mins). Then, after that, maybe meet Deborah if possible (she's available until 3:30 PM, so no). Or Andrew in Embarcadero (available from 8:15 PM). But Andrew needs 75 mins. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Mark, maybe go to Deborah before 3:30 PM. Presidio to Chinatown is 21 mins. Arrive at 3:45 PM + 21 = 4:06 PM, but Deborah leaves at 3:30 PM. So that's too late. So Deborah can't be met after 3:30 PM.\n\nSo maybe the plan is:\n\nAlamo Square start at 9:00 AM.\n\nPossible meetings before Emily:\n\nOption: Meet George in The Castro. Alamo Square to The Castro (8 mins, arrive 9:08 AM). Meet until 10:08 AM. Then travel to Golden Gate Park (11 mins, arrive 10:19 AM). Wait until 11:15 AM. Meet Steven from 11:15 AM to 1:00 PM. Then leave for Emily in Russian Hill (19 mins, arrive 1:19 PM). But Emily needs to start by 12:15 PM. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's prioritize Emily and Steven, as they require longer meetings. Maybe adjust the order.\n\nLet me try to fit Emily's meeting first. To meet Emily from 12:15 PM to 2:00 PM (105 mins). Then after that, go to Mark in Presidio. Travel time from Russian Hill to Presidio is 14 mins. Arrive at 2:14 PM. But Mark is available at 2:45 PM. So wait 31 mins. Then meet Mark from 2:45 PM to 3:45 PM. Then, after that, go to Golden Gate Park (Presidio to GGP is 12 mins, arrive 3:57 PM). Meet Steven from 3:57 PM to 5:42 PM (105 mins). Then, after that, perhaps meet Andrew in Embarcadero from 8:15 PM to 10:00 PM (needs 75 mins). But Steven is available until 9:15 PM. Wait, Steven's meeting ends at 5:42 PM, so there's time before Andrew's availability. What about Deborah and George?\n\nGeorge is available until 2:15 PM. So after meeting Emily and Mark, maybe can't meet George. Deborah is available until 3:30 PM. After meeting Steven until 5:42 PM, Deborah's already left. So maybe need to meet Deborah and George before Emily.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's try:\n\nStart at 9:00 AM.\n\nFirst, meet George in The Castro (8 mins, arrive 9:08 AM, meet until 10:08 AM). Then travel to Chinatown (The Castro to Chinatown is 20 mins, arrive 10:28 AM). Meet Deborah until 11:13 AM (45 mins). Then travel to Golden Gate Park (23 mins, arrive 11:36 AM). Meet Steven from 11:36 AM to 1:21 PM (105 mins). Then travel to Russian Hill (GGP to Russian Hill is 19 mins, arrive 1:40 PM). Emily's window is until 2:15 PM. So meeting from 1:40 PM to 2:15 PM is only 35 mins. Not enough. So not possible.\n\nAlternative: After meeting Deborah, go to Emily's location earlier. Let's see:\n\nAfter Deborah at 11:13 AM, travel to Russian Hill. Chinatown to Russian Hill is 9 mins. Arrive 11:22 AM. Emily is available from 12:15 PM. So wait until 12:15 PM. That's 53 mins of waiting. Then meet Emily from 12:15 PM to 2:00 PM. Then go to Mark in Presidio (14 mins, arrive 2:14 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM. Meet Mark until 3:45 PM. Then go to Golden Gate Park (12 mins, arrive 3:57 PM. Meet Steven until 5:42 PM. Then, after that, maybe meet Andrew at Embarcadero from 8:15 PM to 10:00 PM. Let's see if there's time.\n\nFrom 5:42 PM to 8:15 PM, there's 2h33m. Need to travel from Golden Gate Park to Embarcadero: 25 mins. So leave at 8:15 PM minus 25 mins = 7:50 PM. But that leaves a lot of free time. So Andrew's meeting can be from 8:15 PM to 9:30 PM (75 mins). Then Margaret in Sunset District from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM (60 mins). Travel from Embarcadero to Sunset District is 30 mins. So leave at 9:30 PM, arrive at 10:00 PM. But Margaret is available until 10:30 PM. So meet from 10:00 PM to 10:30 PM (30 mins), which is less than the required 60. So can't meet Margaret.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven at 5:42 PM, maybe go to Andrew earlier. But Andrew is available from 8:15 PM. So that's a gap. Alternatively, use the time between 5:42 PM and 8:15 PM to meet Margaret. But Margaret is available from 9:30 PM. So no.\n\nWait, Margaret is available from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM. Need to meet her for 60 mins. So must meet her from 9:30 to 10:30. But the travel time from Andrew's location (Embarcadero) to Sunset District is 30 mins. If Andrew is met from 8:15 PM to 9:30 PM (75 mins), then leave at 9:30 PM, arrive Sunset District at 10:00 PM, meet Margaret until 10:30 PM. But that's only 30 minutes. Not enough. So can't meet both Andrew and Margaret.\n\nTherefore, need to choose between Andrew and Margaret. Since Andrew requires 75 mins and Margaret 60, and their time windows are adjacent, but with travel time, it's impossible to do both. So pick one. Andrew's meeting time is 8:15 PM to 10:00 PM. If we meet him from 8:15 PM to 9:30 PM, then can't meet Margaret. Alternatively, meet Margaret from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM. But to get there from Embarcadero, it's 30 mins. So if we leave Andrew at 9:30 PM, arrive at 10:00 PM, meet until 10:30 PM (30 mins). Not enough. So perhaps drop Margaret and meet Andrew.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, go to Presidio to meet Mark, but Mark's window is until 7:30 PM. If after Steven at 5:42 PM, go to Mark again? No, already met Mark.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal schedule is:\n\nGeorge (The Castro) \u2192 Deborah (Chinatown) \u2192 Emily (Russian Hill) \u2192 Mark (Presidio) \u2192 Steven (Golden Gate Park) \u2192 Andrew (Embarcadero).\n\nBut let's check timings:\n\nStart at 9:00 AM.\n\n1. Alamo Square to The Castro: 8 mins. Arrive 9:08 AM. Meet George until 10:08 AM.\n2. The Castro to Chinatown: 20 mins. Arrive 10:28 AM. Meet Deborah until 11:13 AM.\n3. Chinatown to Russian Hill: 9 mins. Arrive 11:22 AM. But Emily is available from 12:15 PM. So need to wait until 12:15 PM. That's 53 mins. Not great.\n4. Meet Emily from 12:15 PM to 2:00 PM.\n5. Russian Hill to Presidio: 14 mins. Arrive 2:14 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM. Meet Mark until 3:45 PM.\n6. Presidio to Golden Gate Park: 12 mins. Arrive 3:57 PM. Meet Steven until 5:42 PM.\n7. Golden Gate Park to Embarcadero: 25 mins. Arrive 6:07 PM. But Andrew is available from 8:15 PM. So wait 2h8m. Not ideal. Instead, maybe use this time to meet Steven later. Alternatively, adjust Steven's meeting.\n\nWait, Steven is available until 9:15 PM. So maybe meet Steven after Andrew. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Mark at Presidio until 3:45 PM, travel to Golden Gate Park (12 mins, arrive 3:57 PM). Meet Steven from 3:57 PM to 5:42 PM. Then travel to Embarcadero (25 mins, arrive 6:07 PM). Andrew is available from 8:15 PM. So wait 2h8m. Not good. Alternatively, after Mark, go to Embarcadero first. Presidio to Embarcadero is 20 mins. Arrive at 4:05 PM. Andrew is available from 8:15 PM. So wait 4h10m. Not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Mark at 3:45 PM, go to Golden Gate Park (12 mins), meet Steven until 5:42 PM. Then have free time until 8:15 PM. Then go to Andrew. So that's possible, but it leaves a gap. But that's acceptable if no other options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Steven after Andrew. But Steven is available until 9:15 PM. Let's see:\n\nAndrew's meeting is from 8:15 PM to 9:30 PM (75 mins). Then travel to Golden Gate Park (25 mins). Arrive 9:55 PM. But Steven leaves at 9:15 PM. So no.\n\nSo the best is:\n\nGeorge \u2192 Deborah \u2192 Emily \u2192 Mark \u2192 Steven \u2192 Andrew.\n\nBut the problem is the wait time between Deborah and Emily. Let's see:\n\nAfter Deborah at 11:13 AM, travel to Emily's location. Chinatown to Russian Hill is 9 mins. Arrive 11:22 AM. Emily's available at 12:15 PM. So wait 53 mins. That's a lot. Maybe during this wait time, can meet someone else? But who? Steven is available from 11:15 AM. Maybe after Deborah, go to Steven first, then Emily.\n\nLet's adjust:\n\n1. Meet George from 9:08 AM to 10:08 AM.\n2. The Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11 mins. Arrive 10:19 AM. Wait until 11:15 AM. Meet Steven until 1:00 PM.\n3. Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19 mins. Arrive 1:19 PM. Meet Emily until 2:15 PM (56 mins). Not enough. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, after Steven's meeting, go to Emily. But Steven's meeting ends at 1:00 PM. Travel to Russian Hill (19 mins), arrive 1:19 PM. Meet Emily until 2:15 PM (56 mins). Not enough. So Emily's meeting time is a problem.\n\nAlternative Idea: Split Steven's meeting into two parts. But the minimum is 105 mins, so can't split.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe meet Deborah first, then George, then Steven, then Emily.\n\nLet's try:\n\n1. Alamo Square to Chinatown: 16 mins. Arrive 9:16 AM. Meet Deborah until 10:01 AM.\n2. Chinatown to The Castro: 22 mins. Arrive 10:23 AM. Meet George until 11:23 AM.\n3. The Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11 mins. Arrive 11:34 AM. Meet Steven until 1:19 PM (105 mins).\n4. Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19 mins. Arrive 1:38 PM. Meet Emily until 2:15 PM (37 mins). Not enough.\n\nStill not meeting Emily's required time.\n\nAlternative Idea: Sacrifice meeting George to meet Emily and others. Let's see:\n\nStart at Alamo Square.\n\n1. Go to Golden Gate Park (9 mins). Arrive 9:09 AM. Wait until 11:15 AM. That's a long wait. Not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, meet Deborah first:\n\n1. Alamo Square to Chinatown: 16 mins. Arrive 9:16 AM. Meet until 10:01 AM.\n2. Chinatown to Golden Gate Park: 23 mins. Arrive 10:24 AM. Wait until 11:15 AM. Meet Steven until 1:00 PM.\n3. Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill: 19 mins. Arrive 1:19 PM. Meet Emily until 2:15 PM (56 mins). Not enough.\n\nThis doesn't work either.\n\nHmm. Maybe the only way to meet Emily for 105 mins is to start at 12:15 PM and end at 2:00 PM. Then after that, meet Mark.\n\nSo let's prioritize Emily and Steven. Let's see:\n\nStart at Alamo Square at 9:00 AM.\n\nOption:\n\n1. Meet George from 9:08 AM to 10:08 AM (The Castro).\n2. Travel to Golden Gate Park (11 mins, arrive 10:19 AM). Wait until 11:15 AM. Meet Steven until 1:00 PM.\n3. Travel to Russian Hill (19 mins, arrive 1:19 PM). Meet Emily until 2:15 PM (56 mins). Not enough.\n\nAlternative: After George, go to Emily earlier. But Emily isn't available until 12:15 PM. So after meeting George, maybe go to Deborah in Chinatown.\n\nGeorge's meeting ends at 10:08 AM. The Castro to Chinatown: 20 mins, arrive 10:28 AM. Meet Deborah until 11:13 AM. Then to Russian Hill (9 mins, arrive 11:22 AM). Wait until 12:15 PM. Meet Emily until 2:00 PM. Then to Presidio (14 mins, arrive 2:14 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM. Meet Mark until 3:45 PM. Then to Golden Gate Park (12 mins, arrive 3:57 PM. Meet Steven until 5:42 PM. Then, free until Andrew's meeting at 8:15 PM. Travel from Golden Gate Park to Embarcadero is 25 mins. Leave at 8:15 PM minus 25 = 7:50 PM. So meet Andrew from 8:15 PM to 9:30 PM. Then, Margaret from 9:30 PM. But travel time from Embarcadero to Sunset is 30 mins. Arrive 10:00 PM. Meet until 10:30 PM (30 mins). Not enough.\n\nBut this schedule meets George, Deborah, Emily, Mark, Steven, and Andrew. Margaret is not possible. So that's six people. Can we fit all seven?\n\nAlternatively, drop someone. Let's check if this plan works:\n\nItinerary:\n\n1. George: 9:08-10:08 (The Castro)\n2. Deborah: 10:28-11:13 (Chinatown)\n3. Emily: 12:15-14:00 (Russian Hill)\n4. Mark: 14:45-15:45 (Presidio)\n5. Steven: 15:57-17:42 (Golden Gate Park)\n6. Andrew: 20:15-21:30 (Embarcadero)\n\nBut let's check the travel times between each step.\n\n1. Alamo Square to The Castro: 8 mins. Start at 9:00, arrive 9:08. Correct.\n2. The Castro to Chinatown: 20 mins. Leave 10:08, arrive 10:28. Correct.\n3. Chinatown to Russian Hill: 9 mins. Leave Deborah at 11:13, arrive 11:22. Wait until 12:15 PM (53 mins). Then meet Emily from 12:15-14:00. Correct.\n4. Russian Hill to Presidio: 14 mins. Leave 14:00, arrive 14:14. Wait until 14:45. Meet Mark until 15:45.\n5. Presidio to Golden Gate Park: 12 mins. Leave 15:45, arrive 15:57. Meet Steven until 17:42.\n6. Golden Gate Park to Embarcadero: 25 mins. Leave 17:42, arrive 18:07. Then wait until 20:15 for Andrew. Then meet Andrew from 20:15-21:30.\n\nThis works, but the wait between Steven and Andrew is long. But it's acceptable as there's no other meetings possible. This schedule meets six people: George, Deborah, Emily, Mark, Steven, Andrew. Margaret can't be met. But this seems to be the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but Deborah's meeting ends at 11:13 AM, and then we have to wait until 12:15 PM to meet Emily. That's over an hour of waiting. Is there any way to fit Steven into that time?\n\nAlternatively, after Deborah at 11:13 AM, go to Golden Gate Park to meet Steven. Chinatown to GGP:23 mins. Arrive 11:36. Meet Steven until 13:21 (11:36 + 1h45m). Then go to Emily: GGP to Russian Hill is 19 mins. Arrive 13:40. Emily's available until 14:15. So meet from 13:40 to 14:15 (35 mins). Not enough. So no.\n\nAlternatively, split Steven's meeting. But no, he needs 105 mins. So not possible.\n\nSo the best possible schedule is the one meeting six people: George, Deborah, Emily, Mark, Steven, Andrew.\n\nAnother check: Is there any way to meet Margaret instead of Andrew? Let's see. Andrew requires 75 mins (8:15 PM to 9:30 PM). Margaret is from 21:30 to 22:30. If we skip Andrew, after Steven's meeting ends at 17:42 PM, we can go to Golden Gate Park to Sunset District: 10 mins. But wait, Steven is at Golden Gate Park until 17:42. From Golden Gate Park to Sunset District is 10 mins (travel time). Arrive 17:52. But Margaret is available from 21:30. So that's too early. So no.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Steven, go somewhere else. But no other friends are available during that time. So Andrew is the only option in the evening.\n\nThus, the optimal schedule includes George, Deborah, Emily, Mark, Steven, and Andrew. That's six meetings. Let's confirm the timings and travel times:\n\n1. Meet George: 9:08-10:08 (The Castro). Travel from Alamo Square (9:00 departure).\n\n2. Travel to Chinatown: 20 mins. Arrive 10:28. Meet Deborah 10:28-11:13.\n\n3. Travel to Russian Hill: 9 mins. Arrive 11:22. Wait until 12:15.\n\n4. Meet Emily 12:15-14:00.\n\n5. Travel to Presidio: 14 mins. Arrive 14:14. Wait until 14:45.\n\n6. Meet Mark 14:45-15:45.\n\n7. Travel to Golden Gate Park:12 mins. Arrive 15:57.\n\n8. Meet Steven 15:57-17:42.\n\n9. Travel to Embarcadero:25 mins. Arrive 18:07. Wait until 20:15.\n\n10. Meet Andrew 20:15-21:30.\n\nYes, this works. All meetings fit within their time windows and required durations. Travel times are accounted for. The only waiting periods are between Deborah and Emily (11:22 AM to 12:15 PM) and between Steven and Andrew (17:42 PM to 20:15 PM). But these are unavoidable.\n\nSo the final JSON should reflect this itinerary.",
