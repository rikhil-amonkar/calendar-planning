            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible considering their availability and the travel times between locations. I need to start in The Castro at 9:00 AM. Let's list out all the friends with their constraints:\n\n1. **Steven**: North Beach, 5:30PM-8:30PM, min 15 mins.\n2. **Sarah**: Golden Gate Park, 5:00PM-7:15PM, min 75 mins.\n3. **Brian**: Embarcadero, 2:15PM-4:00PM, min 105 mins. Wait, but his window is only 1h45m (105 minutes). That's exactly the time he's available, so if we need 105 minutes, we have to be there the entire time. But 2:15 to 4:00 is 1h45m (105 mins). So possible, but that would block that entire time.\n4. **Stephanie**: Haight-Ashbury, 10:15AM-12:15PM, min 75 mins.\n5. **Melissa**: Richmond District, 2:00PM-7:30PM, min 30 mins.\n6. **Nancy**: Nob Hill, 8:15AM-12:45PM, min 90 mins. Wait, we start at Castro at 9:00. So Nancy is available until 12:45. The earliest we can get to Nob Hill from Castro is 16 mins (travel time from Castro to Nob Hill is 16 mins). So arrival at 9:16. Then we need 90 minutes with her, which would end at 10:46. But she's available until 12:45. So possible. But that's a big chunk early in the day.\n7. **David**: Marina District, 11:15AM-1:15PM, min 120 mins. His window is exactly 2 hours. So we need to meet him the entire time.\n8. **James**: Presidio, 3:00PM-6:15PM, min 120 mins. His window is 3h15m, so need to fit 2 hours in there.\n9. **Elizabeth**: Union Square, 11:30AM-9:00PM, min 60 mins.\n10. **Robert**: Financial District, 1:15PM-3:15PM, min 45 mins.\n\nFirst, let's see which meetings are impossible due to time constraints:\n\n- Brian's meeting requires the entire 2:15-4:00 slot. So if we meet him, that's 105 minutes. But can we fit that in with other meetings around it?\n\n- David's meeting is 11:15-1:15, so 2 hours. If we do that, it's 11:15-1:15. But that might conflict with others.\n\n- Nancy's meeting needs 90 minutes. If we start at 9:00, leave Castro at 9:00, travel 16 mins to Nob Hill, arrive 9:16. Then meet until 10:46. Then next.\n\nBut David's slot is 11:15-1:15. So between 10:46 and 11:15, can we travel from Nob Hill to Marina District? Let's check the travel time from Nob Hill to Marina District: 11 minutes. So departing Nob Hill at 10:46, arrive Marina at 10:46 + 11 = 10:57. Then wait until 11:15 to start meeting David. That's possible.\n\nBut Stephanie is available from 10:15AM-12:15PM, needing 75 minutes. If we meet her after Nancy, but before David, that may not fit. Let's see:\n\nAfter Nancy ends at 10:46, next possible meeting would be Stephanie at Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Nob Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 15 mins (from Nob Hill to Haight-Ashbury: looking at the travel times, under Nob Hill's list: Haight-Ashbury is 13 mins? Wait, the data says Nob Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 13 minutes. So 10:46 departure, arrive 10:59. Then meet Stephanie from 10:59 to 12:14 (75 minutes). But Stephanie's window is until 12:15. So that's feasible. But then David's meeting is 11:15-1:15. So overlapping. So can't do both.\n\nHmm, conflicting. So need to choose between meeting Stephanie and David. David requires the entire 2 hours, so if we meet David, we can't meet Stephanie. Alternatively, meet Stephanie first, then David, but time might not allow.\n\nWait, Stephanie's slot is 10:15-12:15. If we start meeting her at 10:15, 75 minutes takes us to 11:30. Then travel to Marina District. Travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Marina District is 17 mins. So arrive at 11:47. But David's meeting is 11:15-1:15. So we can start meeting David from 11:47 to 1:15. That's 1h28m, which is 88 minutes, less than the required 120. So not possible. So can't meet both Stephanie and David.\n\nAlternatively, meet David first. David's slot is 11:15-1:15. So meet him from 11:15-1:15. Then after that, travel to Haight-Ashbury. But Stephanie's window ends at 12:15. So even if we leave Marina District at 1:15, we can't meet Stephanie. So if we choose David, Stephanie is impossible.\n\nSo which one is better? Stephanie's min is 75 mins, David's is 120. So if we can meet David for 120, that's a longer time. But Stephanie's slot is earlier. But since David's slot is fixed (11:15-1:15), and Stephanie's slot is 10:15-12:15, perhaps it's better to try to fit Stephanie first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not meet Nancy. If we skip Nancy, could we fit in more people? Let's see.\n\nBut Nancy's available until 12:45, and requires 90 minutes. If we don't meet Nancy, maybe we can start with Stephanie.\n\nStart at Castro at 9:00. Travel to Haight-Ashbury: 6 mins. Arrive 9:06. Stephanie's available from 10:15, so we can't meet her until 10:15. Wait, that's a problem. Because she's not available until 10:15. So even if we arrive early, we have to wait. So maybe start with Nancy first.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nOption 1: Meet Nancy first.\n\nStart at Castro at 9:00. Travel to Nob Hill (16 mins). Arrive 9:16. Meet Nancy from 9:16 to 10:46 (90 mins). Then travel to Marina District (Nob Hill to Marina District is 11 mins). Arrive 10:57. Then meet David from 11:15 to 1:15. But we arrive at 10:57, so have to wait until 11:15. But that's okay. Then meet David for the full 2 hours. Then after 1:15, next is Robert (Financial District, 1:15-3:15, min 45). So from 1:15 to 2:00 (45 mins). But travel time from Marina District to Financial District is 17 mins. So leaving Marina at 1:15, arrive at Financial District at 1:32. Then meet Robert from 1:32 to 2:17 (45 mins). But Robert's window is until 3:15, so that works. Then after that, maybe go to Brian at Embarcadero (2:15-4:00). But Brian needs 105 mins. So if we start at 2:15, end at 4:00. That's possible. So from Robert's meeting ending at 2:17, but Brian's starts at 2:15. So conflicting. So perhaps need to adjust.\n\nWait, let's outline:\n\nAfter David ends at 1:15, go to Financial District to meet Robert. Travel time from Marina District to Financial District is 17 mins. So leaving at 1:15, arrive 1:32. Meet Robert from 1:32 to 2:17 (45 mins). Then from Financial District, go to Embarcadero. Travel time is 4 mins (Financial District to Embarcadero is 4). So arrive at 2:21. Brian's window is 2:15-4:00. So start at 2:21, need 105 mins (until 4:06), but Brian's window ends at 4:00. So can't meet the full 105. So maximum possible is 2:21-4:00 (99 mins). Not enough. So can't meet Brian.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust Robert's meeting. If we meet Robert earlier. Suppose after David's meeting ends at 1:15, go to Robert. But Robert's window is 1:15-3:15. So meet Robert from 1:15 to 2:00 (45 mins). But need to account for travel time from Marina to Financial District (17 mins). So if David's meeting ends at 1:15, leave Marina at 1:15, arrive Financial at 1:32. Then meet from 1:32-2:17. Then travel to Embarcadero at 2:21. Then Brian's window is until 4:00. So 2:21-4:00 is 99 mins. Not enough. So Brian can't be met. So that's a problem. So maybe this path isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: skip Brian. If we can't meet Brian because of time constraints, then maybe focus on others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not meet Robert. Let's see.\n\nAnother option: After David's meeting (11:15-1:15), leave Marina District at 1:15, go to Embarcadero to meet Brian. Travel time from Marina District to Embarcadero is 14 mins. Arrive 1:29. Brian's window is 2:15-4:00. So can't meet yet. So have to wait until 2:15. So from 1:29 to 2:15, that's 46 mins of waiting. Then meet Brian from 2:15-4:00 (105 mins). That works. But then after that, James is available from 3:00-6:15, needing 120 mins. So could we meet James from 4:00-6:00, but travel from Embarcadero to Presidio. Travel time is 20 mins. So leaving Embarcadero at 4:00, arrive Presidio at 4:20. Then meet from 4:20 to 6:20, but James's window ends at 6:15. So that's 4:20-6:15 (115 mins). Not enough. Alternatively, start earlier. If during Brian's meeting, leave a bit early. Wait, Brian's meeting is from 2:15-4:00. To meet James, need 2 hours. Let's say leave Brian at 3:00 (after 45 mins) to go to Presidio. But that's not meeting the 105 mins. So this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, after Brian's meeting ends at 4:00, go to Presidio (20 mins travel). Arrive 4:20. Then meet James from 4:20-6:20. But James's window ends at 6:15. So 4:20-6:15 is 115 mins. Not enough. So can't meet James for 120. So perhaps James is not possible if we meet Brian.\n\nAlternatively, skip Brian and go for James. Let's see.\n\nIf after David's meeting (ends 1:15), go to Presidio. Travel time from Marina District to Presidio: Marina District to Presidio is 10 mins (from Marina District's row, Presidio is 10). So leave at 1:15, arrive 1:25. James is available from 3:00-6:15. So can't meet him until 3:00. So wait from 1:25 to 3:00 (1h35m). Then meet James from 3:00-5:00 (120 mins). That works. Then after 5:00, travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Sarah (5:00-7:15). Travel time from Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 12 mins. Arrive 5:12. Meet Sarah until 6:27 (75 mins). Which is within her window. Then after that, go to North Beach for Steven (5:30-8:30). Travel time from Golden Gate Park to North Beach is 23 mins. So leave Golden Gate at 6:27, arrive North Beach at 6:50. Then meet Steven from 6:50-7:05 (15 mins). That works. Also, Melissa is available 2:00-7:30 in Richmond District. Need 30 mins. So perhaps fit her in after James but before Sarah. After meeting James at 5:00, travel to Richmond District. Presidio to Richmond District is 7 mins. Arrive 5:07. Meet Melissa from 5:07-5:37 (30 mins). Then go to Golden Gate Park (Richmond District to Golden Gate Park is 9 mins. Arrive 5:46. Meet Sarah from 5:46-6:46 (60 mins), but she requires 75. So not enough. Alternatively, maybe meet Melissa later.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's outline a possible itinerary step by step.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Start at Castro 9:00.\n\n- Meet Nancy at Nob Hill: 9:16-10:46 (90 mins).\n\n- Travel to Marina District (11 mins): arrive 10:57.\n\n- Meet David 11:15-1:15 (120 mins).\n\n- Travel to Financial District (17 mins): arrive 1:32.\n\n- Meet Robert 1:32-2:17 (45 mins).\n\n- Travel to Embarcadero (4 mins): arrive 2:21.\n\n- Meet Brian 2:21-4:00 (99 mins, but needs 105. Not enough. So this doesn't work.)\n\nSo Brian can't be met here.\n\nAlternative after Robert:\n\nFrom Financial District, go to Presidio (23 mins? Financial District to Presidio is 22 mins). Arrive 2:17 + 22 = 2:39. James's window starts at 3:00. Wait until 3:00, then meet from 3:00-5:00. That's 120 mins. Then after 5:00, travel to Golden Gate Park (Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 12 mins. Arrive 5:12). Meet Sarah from 5:12-6:27 (75 mins). Then travel to North Beach (23 mins, arrive 6:50). Meet Steven 6:50-7:05. Then Melissa: from North Beach to Richmond District (17 mins, arrive 7:22. Meet Melissa 7:22-7:52 (30 mins). But Melissa's window is until 7:30. So that's too late. So Melissa can't be met here.\n\nAlternatively, after James, go to Richmond District (Presidio to Richmond is 7 mins. Arrive 5:07). Meet Melissa 5:07-5:37. Then to Golden Gate Park (9 mins, arrive 5:46). Meet Sarah 5:46-7:01 (75 mins). Then to North Beach (23 mins, arrive 7:24). Meet Steven 7:24-7:39. But Steven's window is until 8:30. That's okay. But Sarah's window ends at 7:15. So meeting her until 7:01 is within her time. However, 5:46-7:01 is 75 mins. But Sarah's window is until 7:15, so possible.\n\nBut Elizabeth is available from 11:30AM to 9:00PM, needing 60 mins. Haven't fit her in yet. When can we meet her? Let's see. Maybe after Robert.\n\nAfter meeting Robert from 1:32-2:17, then travel to Union Square. Financial District to Union Square is 9 mins (from Financial District's row: Union Square is 9 mins). Arrive 2:26. Meet Elizabeth from 2:26-3:26. Then go to Presidio. Union Square to Presidio is 24 mins. Arrive 3:50. Then meet James from 3:50-5:50. But James's window ends at 6:15. So possible, but need to check travel time. Wait, James is at Presidio. So if arrive at 3:50, start meeting at 3:50, end at 5:50 (120 mins). That works. Then after that, same as before: Melissa and Sarah.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's try to prioritize the longer meetings first because they are harder to fit.\n\nLongest required times:\n\n- Brian: 105 mins (exactly his window)\n- David: 120 mins (exactly his window)\n- James: 120 mins (needs 2 hours)\n- Sarah: 75 mins\n- Stephanie: 75 mins\n- Nancy: 90 mins\n- Melissa: 30\n- Steven: 15\n- Elizabeth: 60\n- Robert: 45\n\nBut David and Brian have fixed time slots. David's is 11:15-1:15 (120 mins), Brian's is 2:15-4:00 (105 mins). James is 3:00-6:15 (3h15m). So maybe Brian and David are must-meet if possible.\n\nBut if we do David's meeting (11:15-1:15), then after that, Robert's window is 1:15-3:15. So meet Robert for 45 mins (1:15-2:00). But need to travel from Marina District to Financial District (17 mins). So if David ends at 1:15, leave Marina District at 1:15, arrive Financial District at 1:32. Meet Robert 1:32-2:17. Then go to Brian at Embarcadero (Financial District to Embarcadero is 4 mins. Arrive 2:21). Brian's window starts at 2:15. So meet from 2:21-4:00 (99 mins). Not enough. So Brian can't be met.\n\nAlternative, if we meet Brian first. Let's see:\n\nBut Brian is available from 2:15-4:00. To meet him for 105 mins, need exactly his window. So must be there 2:15-4:00. But how to get there.\n\nIf we start at Castro 9:00.\n\nOption: Meet Nancy first.\n\n9:00 Castro \u2192 9:16 Nob Hill. Meet Nancy 9:16-10:46. Then travel to Haight-Ashbury (13 mins). Arrive 10:59. Meet Stephanie from 10:59-12:14 (75 mins). Then travel to Marina District (17 mins). Arrive 12:31. David's window is 11:15-1:15. So arriving at 12:31, meet until 1:15 (44 mins). Not enough. So can't meet David. So that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, after Nancy, go to Marina District to meet David. From Nob Hill to Marina District is 11 mins. Arrive 10:57. Then meet David 11:15-1:15. That works. Then after David, travel to Financial District (17 mins. Arrive 1:32. Meet Robert 1:32-2:17. Then go to Brian at Embarcadero (4 mins. Arrive 2:21. Meet until 4:00. 99 mins. Not enough. So Brian can't be met.\n\nAlternatively, after Robert, go to James. Financial District to Presidio is 22 mins. Arrive 2:17 + 22 = 2:39. James's window starts at 3:00. Wait until 3:00. Meet from 3:00-5:00. Then go to Golden Gate Park (12 mins. Arrive 5:12). Meet Sarah 5:12-6:27. Then to North Beach (23 mins. Arrive 6:50. Meet Steven until 7:05. Then Melissa: North Beach to Richmond District (17 mins. Arrive 7:22. Meet until 7:52 (but Melissa's window ends at 7:30. So can't).\n\nAlternatively, after James, go to Richmond District. Presidio to Richmond District is 7 mins. Arrive 5:07. Meet Melissa 5:07-5:37. Then Golden Gate Park (9 mins. Arrive 5:46). Meet Sarah until 7:01 (75 mins). Then to North Beach (23 mins. Arrive 7:24. Meet Steven until 7:39. Elizabeth hasn't been met yet. When can she fit? Maybe after Robert.\n\nAfter Robert at 2:17, go to Union Square. Financial District to Union Square is 9 mins. Arrive 2:26. Meet Elizabeth 2:26-3:26. Then go to Presidio (24 mins. Arrive 3:50. Meet James 3:50-5:50. Then proceed as before. This allows meeting Elizabeth.\n\nBut this way, the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Nancy: 9:16-10:46\n2. David: 11:15-1:15\n3. Robert: 1:32-2:17\n4. Elizabeth: 2:26-3:26\n5. James: 3:50-5:50\n6. Melissa: 5:57-6:27 (Presidio to Richmond District 7 mins, arrive 5:57, meet until 6:27)\nWait, Melissa's window is until 7:30, so that's okay. Then travel to Golden Gate Park (9 mins. Arrive 6:36. Meet Sarah from 6:36-7:51. But Sarah's window ends at 7:15. So that's a problem. So can't meet Sarah. Alternatively, after Melissa, go to Golden Gate Park, arrive 6:36. Meet Sarah until 7:15 (39 mins). Not enough. So can't meet Sarah.\n\nAlternatively, after James, go to Golden Gate Park first. Presidio to Golden Gate Park 12 mins. Arrive 5:50 +12 = 6:02. Meet Sarah from 6:02-7:17 (75 mins). But her window ends at 7:15. So 6:02-7:15 is 73 mins. Close but not enough. So not possible.\n\nHmm. So perhaps Sarah can't be met in this schedule. Maybe we need to prioritize other people.\n\nAlternatively, meet Sarah after Golden Gate Park. Let's see. If after meeting James (5:00-7:00), but James's window ends at 6:15. So no.\n\nThis is getting very complex. Let's try to outline which meetings are possible:\n\nMust meet:\n\n- David (requires 11:15-1:15)\n- Steven (needs 15 mins after 5:30)\n- Sarah (needs 75 mins between 5-7:15)\n- James (needs 2 hours between 3-6:15)\n- Melissa (30 mins between 2-7:30)\n- Elizabeth (60 mins between 11:30-9)\n- Robert (45 mins between 1:15-3:15)\n- Nancy (90 mins between 8:45-12:45)\n- Brian (105 mins between 2:15-4:00)\n- Stephanie (75 mins between 10:15-12:15)\n\nBut it's impossible to meet all. So need to prioritize which ones can fit.\n\nLooking at the required times and windows:\n\n- Brian's window is exactly his required time, so must be there the entire window.\n- David's window is exactly his required time.\n- James requires 2 hours, which is possible within his 3h15m window.\n- Nancy needs 90 mins, which can fit in her window.\n- Stephanie needs 75 mins in her 2-hour window.\n- Sarah needs 75 mins in her 2h15m window.\n- The others have more flexibility.\n\nSo the problem is that meeting Brian and David and James might block too much time. Let's try to fit the following:\n\nStart at Castro 9:00.\n\n- Meet Nancy at Nob Hill: 9:16-10:46.\n\nThen travel to Haight-Ashbury (13 mins). Arrive 10:59. Meet Stephanie 10:59-12:14 (75 mins).\n\nThen travel to Marina District (17 mins). Arrive 12:31. But David's window is 11:15-1:15. So arriving at 12:31, meet David until 1:15 (44 mins). Not enough. So can't meet David here.\n\nAlternatively, after Nancy, go to Marina District to meet David.\n\nFrom Nob Hill to Marina District is 11 mins. Arrive 10:57. Meet David 11:15-1:15. Then go to Stephanie's location? No, Stephanie's window ends at 12:15. So not possible.\n\nSo if we meet David, Stephanie is out. So choose between Stephanie and David.\n\nIf we choose David:\n\nAfter David ends at 1:15, travel to Financial District (17 mins). Arrive 1:32. Meet Robert 1:32-2:17. Then go to Brian at Embarcadero (4 mins). Arrive 2:21. Meet Brian until 4:00 (99 mins). Not enough. So Brian is out.\n\nAlternatively, after Robert, go to James. Financial District to Presidio (22 mins). Arrive 2:17 +22=2:39. James's window starts at 3:00. Wait until 3:00. Meet 3:00-5:00. Then go to Golden Gate Park (12 mins). Arrive 5:12. Meet Sarah until 6:27. Then go to North Beach (23 mins. Arrive 6:50. Meet Steven until 7:05. Then go to Richmond District (17 mins. Arrive 7:22. Meet Melissa until 7:52 (but her window ends at 7:30). So can't. So meet Melissa earlier.\n\nAfter James (5:00), go to Richmond District (7 mins. Arrive 5:07). Meet Melissa 5:07-5:37. Then to Golden Gate Park (9 mins. Arrive 5:46. Meet Sarah until 7:01. Then to North Beach (23 mins. Arrive 7:24. Meet Steven 7:24-7:39. Elizabeth hasn't been met yet. So after Robert, perhaps go to Union Square.\n\nAfter Robert (ends 2:17), go to Union Square (9 mins from Financial District). Arrive 2:26. Meet Elizabeth 2:26-3:26. Then go to Presidio (24 mins. Arrive 3:50. Meet James 3:50-5:50. Then proceed as before. This way, Elizabeth is met.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Nancy: 9:16-10:46\n2. David: 11:15-1:15\n3. Robert: 1:32-2:17\n4. Elizabeth: 2:26-3:26\n5. James: 3:50-5:50\n6. Melissa: 5:57-6:27 (Presidio to Richmond District 7 mins)\n7. Sarah: 6:36-7:51 (Richmond District to Golden Gate Park 9 mins, but Sarah's window ends at 7:15 \u2192 so meet until 7:15 \u2192 6:36-7:15 is 39 mins, not enough)\nSo can't meet Sarah. So maybe skip Sarah and meet Steven.\n\nAfter Melissa: 5:37, travel to North Beach (Richmond District to North Beach is 17 mins. Arrive 5:54. Meet Steven 5:54-6:09. Then go to Golden Gate Park (23 mins. Arrive 6:32. Meet Sarah until 7:15 (43 mins). Not enough. So Sarah is out.\n\nAlternatively, after James, go to Golden Gate Park. Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 12 mins. Arrive 5:50 +12=6:02. Meet Sarah until 7:15 (73 mins. Not enough 75).\n\nAlternatively, skip Sarah. So in this itinerary, we can meet Nancy, David, Robert, Elizabeth, James, Melissa, and Steven. That's seven people. But what about Elizabeth? She's met from 2:26-3:26. Yes.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n[\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Nob Hill\", \"person\": \"Nancy\", \"start_time\": \"9:16\", \"end_time\": \"10:46\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"13:15\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"13:32\", \"end_time\": \"14:17\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Union Square\", \"person\": \"Elizabeth\", \"start_time\": \"14:26\", \"end_time\": \"15:26\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Presidio\", \"person\": \"James\", \"start_time\": \"15:50\", \"end_time\": \"17:50\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Richmond District\", \"person\": \"Melissa\", \"start_time\": \"17:57\", \"end_time\": \"18:27\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Steven\", \"start_time\": \"18:50\", \"end_time\": \"19:05\"}\n]\n\nWait, but Melissa's end time is 7:30. So 18:27 is 6:27 PM, which is within her window. Steven's meeting starts at 18:50 (6:50 PM) which is within his window (5:30PM-8:30PM). So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, after James ends at 17:50 (5:50 PM), travel to Richmond District (7 mins) \u2192 arrive 17:57 (5:57 PM). Meet Melissa until 18:27 (6:27 PM). Then travel to North Beach: Richmond District to North Beach is 17 mins. Arrive 18:44 (6:44 PM). Meet Steven from 18:44 to 18:59 (15 mins). But Steven is available until 8:30 PM, so that's okay.\n\nSo adjusting the itinerary:\n\n[\n  Nancy: 9:16-10:46,\n  David: 11:15-13:15,\n  Robert: 13:32-14:17,\n  Elizabeth: 14:26-15:26,\n  James: 15:50-17:50,\n  Melissa: 17:57-18:27,\n  Steven: 18:44-18:59\n]\n\nThis way, we meet 7 people. What about others? Stephanie and Sarah and Brian are not met. Brian's window is 2:15-4:00, but in this itinerary, after Robert, we're meeting Elizabeth and James, so Brian can't be met. Stephanie's window is 10:15-12:15, but we're meeting Nancy and David during that time.\n\nSo this is the best possible with these constraints. Other combinations might allow meeting more people, but it's challenging. For example, skipping Nancy to meet Stephanie and others. Let's see:\n\nAlternative itinerary:\n\nStart at Castro 9:00.\n\nTravel to Haight-Ashbury (6 mins \u2192 9:06). But Stephanie's available from 10:15. So wait from 9:06 to 10:15 (69 mins). Not efficient. Then meet Stephanie 10:15-11:30 (75 mins). Then travel to Marina District (17 mins. Arrive 11:47). Meet David 11:47-13:47. But David's window is until 13:15. So meet until 13:15 (1h28m). Not enough. So can't.\n\nSo this alternative is worse. So the first itinerary seems better.\n\nThus, the optimal schedule is to meet Nancy, David, Robert, Elizabeth, James, Melissa, and Steven.",
