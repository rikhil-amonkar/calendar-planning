            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule meetings with as many friends as possible in San Francisco, starting from Bayview at 9:00 AM. The constraints are pretty tight with specific time windows for each person. Let me start by listing all the people and their availability along with the required meeting durations.\n\nFirst, Matthew at Presidio from 8:15 AM to 9:00 AM. Wait, I arrive at Bayview at 9:00 AM. So Matthew's time is before I even get there. That's impossible. So maybe I can't meet Matthew? The available time for Matthew is 8:15-9:00 AM, but I start at Bayview at 9 AM. So travel time from Bayview to Presidio is 32 minutes. So even if I leave Bayview at 9 AM, I arrive at Presidio at 9:32 AM, which is after Matthew's window ends at 9:00 AM. So Matthew can't be met. So cross him off.\n\nNext, Richard is at Fisherman's Wharf from 11:00 AM to 12:45 PM, need at least 60 minutes. So I need to meet him during that window. Let's see. Starting at Bayview at 9 AM. The travel time from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes. So leaving at 9 AM, arrive at 9:25 AM. But Richard isn't there until 11 AM. So maybe I can do other meetings first.\n\nElizabeth is at Nob Hill from 11:45 AM to 6:30 PM, needs 75 minutes. Anthony is at Pacific Heights from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM, needs 30 minutes. Brian at North Beach from 1 PM to 7 PM, needs 90 minutes. Kenneth at Chinatown from 1:45 PM to 7:30 PM, needs 105 minutes. Ashley at Haight-Ashbury from 3 PM to 8:30 PM, 90 minutes. Deborah at Union Square 5:30 PM to 10 PM, 60 mins. Kimberly at Alamo Square 5:30 PM to 9:15 PM, 45 mins. Jessica at Golden Gate Park 8 PM to 9:45 PM, 105 mins. \n\nLet me try to fit as many as possible. Let's start with the earliest possible meetings.\n\nFirst, after arriving at Bayview at 9 AM, maybe go to Richard at Fisherman's Wharf. But Richard's available from 11 AM. So perhaps the first meeting is Richard. Let's check the travel time. From Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes. If I leave Bayview at 10:35 AM, arrive at 11 AM. Then meet Richard from 11 AM to 12:00 PM (60 minutes). That works because he's available until 12:45 PM. So that's one meeting.\n\nThen after Richard, maybe go to Elizabeth at Nob Hill. Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 10 minutes (Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes? Wait, looking at the travel times: Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. So if I leave Fisherman's Wharf at 12:00 PM, arrive at Nob Hill at 12:11 PM. But Elizabeth's available from 11:45 AM. So she's available starting 11:45 AM. So starting at 12:11 PM, possible. She needs 75 minutes. So from 12:11 PM to 1:26 PM. But her window is until 6:30 PM, so that's okay. But then after that, where next?\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Richard, go to someone else. Let's see. Let's check the next possible meetings.\n\nAfter meeting Richard from 11 AM to 12 PM, next slot. Then maybe go to Elizabeth at Nob Hill. Arrive at 12:11 PM, meet until 1:26 PM. Then next, perhaps Brian at North Beach. Brian is available from 1 PM. So after Elizabeth, leaving Nob Hill at 1:26 PM, travel time to North Beach. Nob Hill to North Beach is 8 minutes. So arrive at 1:34 PM. Meet Brian from 1:34 PM to 3:04 PM (90 minutes). That would end at 3:04 PM. Then next, maybe Anthony at Pacific Heights from 2:15 PM to 4 PM. But if I'm meeting Brian until 3:04 PM, then Anthony's window ends at 4 PM. So travel time from North Beach to Pacific Heights is 8 minutes (North Beach to Pacific Heights is 8). So leave at 3:04 PM, arrive at 3:12 PM. Meet Anthony from 3:12 PM to 3:42 PM (30 minutes). That's within his 2:15 PM to 4 PM window. So that works. \n\nThen after that, Ashley at Haight-Ashbury from 3 PM to 8:30 PM. Needs 90 mins. Travel time from Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury is 11 minutes. So leave at 3:42 PM, arrive at 3:53 PM. Meet from 3:53 PM to 5:23 PM. Then after that, Kimberly at Alamo Square (5:30 PM to 9:15 PM, 45 mins). Travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Alamo Square is 5 minutes. So leave at 5:23 PM, arrive at 5:28 PM. But Kimberly is available from 5:30 PM. So wait until 5:30 PM. Meet from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. Then Deborah at Union Square from 5:30 PM. Travel time from Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 minutes (Alamo Square to Union Square is 14). So leave at 6:15 PM, arrive at 6:29 PM. Meet Deborah from 6:29 PM to 7:29 PM (60 mins). Then maybe Kenneth at Chinatown (available until 7:30 PM). Travel time from Union Square to Chinatown is 7 minutes (Union Square to Chinatown is 7). Leave at 7:29 PM, arrive at 7:36 PM. But Kenneth's window ends at 7:30 PM. So that's too late. Alternatively, maybe after Deborah, go to Kenneth. Wait, Deborah's meeting ends at 7:29 PM, and Kenneth is available until 7:30 PM. So arriving at 7:36 PM is after 7:30 PM. So that's not possible. So maybe need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, after Kimberly at Alamo Square, perhaps go to Kenneth before Deborah. Let me think. Kimberly's meeting ends at 6:15 PM. From Alamo Square to Chinatown is 15 minutes. So leave at 6:15 PM, arrive at 6:30 PM. Kenneth is available until 7:30 PM. Needs 105 minutes (1h45m). But 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM is only 60 minutes. Not enough. So that's impossible. So maybe Kenneth is not feasible. Alternatively, maybe if we can fit him earlier.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Brian, perhaps meet Kenneth. Let me see. Let's backtrack.\n\nAfter meeting Brian from 1:34 PM to 3:04 PM at North Beach, then maybe go to Kenneth. North Beach to Chinatown is 6 minutes. So arrive at 3:10 PM. Kenneth is available from 1:45 PM to 7:30 PM. Needs 105 minutes. From 3:10 PM to 4:55 PM. That would end at 4:55 PM. Then after that, go to Anthony. But Anthony is only available until 4 PM. So that doesn't work. So maybe that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe switch the order. Let's see:\n\nAfter Richard (11 AM-12 PM), go to Elizabeth at Nob Hill from 12:11 PM to 1:26 PM. Then go to Anthony at Pacific Heights. Nob Hill to Pacific Heights is 8 minutes. Arrive at 1:34 PM. But Anthony is available from 2:15 PM. So that's too early. So can't meet Anthony until 2:15 PM. So maybe after Elizabeth, go to Brian. Nob Hill to North Beach is 8 minutes. Arrive at 1:26 PM + 8 = 1:34 PM. Brian is available from 1 PM. So meet Brian from 1:34 PM to 3:04 PM (90 mins). Then from North Beach to Pacific Heights is 8 minutes. Arrive at 3:12 PM. Anthony is available until 4 PM. So meet from 3:12 PM to 3:42 PM. Then to Haight-Ashbury (11 mins). Arrive 3:53 PM. Meet Ashley until 5:23 PM. Then to Alamo Square (5 mins, arrive 5:28 PM). Wait until 5:30 PM, meet Kimberly until 6:15 PM. Then to Union Square (14 mins, arrive 6:29 PM). Meet Deborah until 7:29 PM. Then to Jessica at Golden Gate Park. Union Square to Golden Gate Park is 22 mins. Arrive at 7:51 PM. Jessica is available from 8 PM. So need to wait until 8 PM. Meet from 8 PM to 9:45 PM (105 mins). That works. But what about Kenneth? He needs 105 mins. Let's see if there's a way to fit him in.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Deborah at Union Square until 7:29 PM, perhaps go to Kenneth. But Union Square to Chinatown is 7 mins. Arrive at 7:36 PM. Kenneth's window ends at 7:30 PM. So no. What if we meet Kenneth before Deborah? Let's see:\n\nAfter Kimberly ends at 6:15 PM, go to Kenneth. Alamo Square to Chinatown is 15 mins. Arrive at 6:30 PM. Meet from 6:30 PM to 8:15 PM (105 mins). But Kenneth's available until 7:30 PM. So that's impossible. So can't meet Kenneth. So maybe he's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Anthony, go to Kenneth instead of Ashley. Let's try:\n\nAfter Anthony ends at 3:42 PM, travel to Chinatown. Pacific Heights to Chinatown is 11 mins. Arrive at 3:53 PM. Meet from 3:53 PM to 5:38 PM (105 mins). But Kenneth's available until 7:30 PM. That works. Then after that, go to Ashley. Chinatown to Haight-Ashbury is 19 mins. Arrive at 5:57 PM. Meet from 5:57 PM to 7:27 PM (90 mins). But Ashley's available until 8:30 PM. Then after that, Kimberly at Alamo Square. Haight-Ashbury to Alamo Square is 5 mins. Arrive at 7:32 PM. Kimberly is available until 9:15 PM. Meet from 7:32 PM to 8:17 PM (45 mins). Then Deborah at Union Square. Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 mins. Arrive at 8:31 PM. Deborah's available until 10 PM. Meet from 8:31 PM to 9:31 PM. Then Jessica at Golden Gate Park. Union Square to Golden Gate Park is 22 mins. Arrive at 9:53 PM. Jessica is available until 9:45 PM. So that's too late. So this schedule misses Jessica. So this might not be better.\n\nHmm, maybe Jessica is important since she's the last one. Let's see. If we prioritize Jessica, after meeting Deborah until 7:29 PM, then go to Jessica. Union Square to Golden Gate Park is 22 mins. Arrive at 7:51 PM. But Jessica is available from 8 PM. Wait until 8 PM. Meet from 8 PM to 9:45 PM. That works. But then what about Kenneth? If we can't fit him in, then the total meetings would be Richard, Elizabeth, Brian, Anthony, Ashley, Kimberly, Deborah, Jessica. That's 8 meetings. But we have to check if all the timings are correct.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the first plan:\n\n1. Meet Richard: 11-12 (Fisherman's Wharf)\n2. Elizabeth: 12:11-1:26 (Nob Hill)\n3. Brian: 1:34-3:04 (North Beach)\n4. Anthony: 3:12-3:42 (Pacific Heights)\n5. Ashley: 3:53-5:23 (Haight-Ashbury)\n6. Kimberly: 5:30-6:15 (Alamo Square)\n7. Deborah: 6:29-7:29 (Union Square)\n8. Jessica: 8:00-9:45 (Golden Gate Park)\n\nThat's 8 meetings. But let's check the travel times and overlaps.\n\nAfter Richard ends at 12 PM, Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 mins. Arrive at 12:11 PM. Start Elizabeth at 12:11 PM. Meet until 1:26 PM (75 mins). Then Nob Hill to North Beach is 7 mins. Arrive at 1:33 PM. Wait, earlier I thought it's 8 mins, but checking the data: Nob Hill to North Beach is 7 mins (from the travel times list: Nob Hill to North Beach: 7). So travel time is 7 mins. So leaving Nob Hill at 1:26 PM, arrive at North Beach at 1:33 PM. Meet Brian from 1:33 PM to 3:03 PM (90 mins). Then North Beach to Pacific Heights is 8 mins. Arrive at 3:11 PM. Meet Anthony from 3:11 PM to 3:41 PM (30 mins). Then Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury is 11 mins. Arrive at 3:52 PM. Meet Ashley from 3:52 PM to 5:22 PM (90 mins). Then Haight-Ashbury to Alamo Square is 5 mins. Arrive at 5:27 PM. Wait until 5:30 PM. Meet Kimberly from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM (45 mins). Then Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 mins. Arrive at 6:29 PM. Meet Deborah from 6:29 PM to 7:29 PM. Then Union Square to Golden Gate Park is 22 mins. Arrive at 7:51 PM. Wait until 8 PM. Meet Jessica from 8 PM to 9:45 PM. So that works. \n\nThis gives us 8 meetings. But wait, can we fit Kenneth in?\n\nIf after meeting Deborah at 7:29 PM, can we go to Kenneth? But Union Square to Chinatown is 7 mins. Arrive at 7:36 PM. Kenneth's available until 7:30 PM. So no. So he's not possible. So this plan misses Kenneth and Matthew. But Matthew's time was impossible. So total 8 meetings.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to fit Kenneth in earlier?\n\nFor example, after meeting Elizabeth at Nob Hill, instead of going to Brian, go to Kenneth. Let's see:\n\nAfter Elizabeth ends at 1:26 PM, Nob Hill to Chinatown is 6 mins. So arrive at 1:32 PM. Meet Kenneth from 1:32 PM to 3:17 PM (105 mins). That ends at 3:17 PM. Then travel to Brian's location (North Beach) from Chinatown. Chinatown to North Beach is 3 mins. Arrive at 3:20 PM. Brian's available until 7 PM. Meet from 3:20 PM to 4:50 PM (90 mins). Then from North Beach to Pacific Heights is 8 mins. Arrive at 4:58 PM. But Anthony's available until 4 PM. So too late. So Anthony can't be met here. So this way, we lose Anthony but gain Kenneth.\n\nSo comparing which gives more meetings. Original plan has 8 meetings (including Anthony, missing Kenneth). This alternative plan would have 8 meetings (Richard, Elizabeth, Kenneth, Brian, Ashley, Kimberly, Deborah, Jessica). But Anthony is lost. So which is better? Since the goal is to meet as many as possible, both are 8. But perhaps the original plan includes Anthony and misses Kenneth, while this alternative swaps them. Which is better? The required times are Anthony: 30 mins, Kenneth: 105 mins. But perhaps the user wants to meet as many as possible, regardless of duration. But the problem states to meet as many friends as possible. So 8 in either case. Hmm. Maybe the original plan is better because the durations are all met, but in terms of numbers, it's the same. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to fit more.\n\nWait, another approach: After meeting Richard (11-12), go to Elizabeth (12:11-1:26). Then Brian (1:34-3:04). Then Anthony (3:12-3:42). Then Kenneth (3:42 + travel to Chinatown: from Pacific Heights to Chinatown is 11 mins. Arrive 3:53 PM. Meet until 5:38 PM (105 mins). Then Ashley from 5:53 PM (Haight-Ashbury). But travel time from Chinatown to Haight-Ashbury is 19 mins. Arrive 5:57 PM. Meet until 7:27 PM. Then Kimberly (Alamo Square) from 7:32 PM to 8:17 PM. Then Deborah from 8:31 PM (Union Square) to 9:31 PM. Then Jessica from 9:31 PM, but she's available until 9:45 PM. Travel time from Union Square to Golden Gate Park is 22 mins. Arrive 9:53 PM, which is after her window. So Jessica is missed. So this way, we get Kenneth but lose Jessica, so total 8 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Kenneth, go to Jessica. Let's see: Kenneth ends at 5:38 PM. From Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 mins. Arrive at 6:01 PM. Jessica is available from 8 PM. So wait until 8 PM. That's two hours of waiting. Not efficient. So can't meet her. So this approach loses Jessica. So the original plan is better with 8 meetings.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe after meeting Deborah at Union Square, go to Jessica. Union Square to Golden Gate Park is 22 mins. If Deborah ends at 7:29 PM, leave at 7:29 PM, arrive at 7:51 PM. Jessica is available from 8 PM. Wait until 8 PM, meet until 9:45 PM. That works. So in this case, we have 8 meetings: Richard, Elizabeth, Brian, Anthony, Ashley, Kimberly, Deborah, Jessica. Missed Kenneth and Matthew.\n\nAlternatively, can we fit Kenneth in between some other meetings? Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Brian from 1:34 PM to 3:04 PM, go to Chinatown (6 mins from North Beach). Arrive at 3:10 PM. Meet Kenneth from 3:10 PM to 4:55 PM (105 mins). Then from Chinatown to Pacific Heights is 10 mins. Arrive at 5:05 PM. But Anthony is available until 4 PM. So Anthony is missed. Then proceed to Ashley: Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury is 11 mins. Arrive at 5:16 PM. Meet until 6:46 PM. Then Kimberly: 6:46 PM + 5 mins travel to Alamo Square, arrive 6:51 PM. Meet until 7:36 PM. Then Deborah: Alamo Square to Union Square 14 mins. Arrive 7:50 PM. Meet until 8:50 PM. Then Jessica: travel 22 mins, arrive 9:12 PM. Jessica's available until 9:45 PM. Meet from 9:12 PM to 10:57 PM, but she's only available until 9:45 PM. So only 33 minutes, which is less than the required 105. So that doesn't work. So this approach misses Anthony and Jessica's full duration, but gains Kenneth. Not better.\n\nSo the best is the original plan with 8 meetings. Let me verify each step:\n\n1. Start at Bayview at 9 AM.\n2. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (25 mins): arrive 9:25 AM. But Richard is available from 11 AM. So wait from 9:25 AM to 11 AM. Then meet Richard from 11 AM to 12 PM. That's possible.\n\nWait, wait a minute. The initial plan assumed leaving Bayview at 10:35 AM to arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 11 AM. Because the user arrives at Bayview at 9 AM. So to reach Fisherman's Wharf by 11 AM, leave Bayview at 10:35 AM (25 mins travel). So meet Richard from 11 AM to 12 PM. Then travel to Nob Hill (11 mins) arrives 12:11 PM. Meet Elizabeth until 1:26 PM. Then travel to North Beach (7 mins) arrives 1:33 PM. Meet Brian until 3:03 PM. Then to Pacific Heights (8 mins) arrives 3:11 PM. Meet Anthony until 3:41 PM. Then to Haight-Ashbury (11 mins) arrives 3:52 PM. Meet Ashley until 5:22 PM. Then to Alamo Square (5 mins) arrives 5:27 PM. Wait until 5:30 PM. Meet Kimberly until 6:15 PM. Then to Union Square (14 mins) arrives 6:29 PM. Meet Deborah until 7:29 PM. Then to Golden Gate Park (22 mins) arrives 7:51 PM. Wait until 8 PM. Meet Jessica until 9:45 PM. \n\nYes, all timings fit. Each meeting meets the required duration, and the travel times are accounted for. So this gives 8 meetings. But can we fit Kenneth in?\n\nWait, maybe after meeting Elizabeth at Nob Hill, before Brian. Let me see:\n\nAfter Elizabeth ends at 1:26 PM, go to Chinatown (Nob Hill to Chinatown is 6 mins). Arrive 1:32 PM. Meet Kenneth from 1:32 PM to 3:17 PM. Then travel to North Beach (3 mins) arrive 3:20 PM. Meet Brian until 4:50 PM. Then to Pacific Heights (8 mins) arrive 4:58 PM. Anthony's window ends at 4 PM. So can't meet him. Then proceed to Ashley. Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury (11 mins) arrive 5:09 PM. Meet until 6:39 PM. Then to Alamo Square (5 mins) arrive 6:44 PM. Meet Kimberly until 7:29 PM. Then to Union Square (14 mins) arrive 7:43 PM. Meet Deborah until 8:43 PM. Then to Golden Gate Park (22 mins) arrive 9:05 PM. Jessica's available until 9:45 PM. Meet from 9:05 PM to 10:50 PM, but she's only there until 9:45 PM. So only 40 mins. Not enough. So this way, lose Anthony and Jessica's full duration, but gain Kenneth. So total meetings: Richard, Elizabeth, Kenneth, Brian, Ashley, Kimberly, Deborah. That's 7, but Jessica's partial. So not better.\n\nThus, the original plan with 8 meetings is better.\n\nSo the final itinerary includes:\n\n- Richard (11-12)\n- Elizabeth (12:11-1:26)\n- Brian (1:34-3:04)\n- Anthony (3:12-3:42)\n- Ashley (3:53-5:23)\n- Kimberly (5:30-6:15)\n- Deborah (6:29-7:29)\n- Jessica (8:00-9:45)\n\nThat's eight meetings. All durations are met, and travel times are accounted for without overlaps.",
