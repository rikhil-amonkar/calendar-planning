            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to schedule all these meetings. First, I need to start at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM. The constraints are pretty tight with all the people and their availability. Let me list out each person's time slots and the minimum time required.\n\nEmily at Pacific Heights from 9:15 AM to 1:45 PM, needs 120 minutes. So I need to meet her for two hours. Since I start at Russian Hill at 9, it takes 7 minutes to get to Pacific Heights. So maybe leave at 9:07, arrive at 9:14. But Emily is available from 9:15. So maybe start at 9:15. Then stay until 11:15, which is exactly 2 hours. That works.\n\nNext, James at Embarcadero from 10:30 to 11:30. Wait, but if I'm meeting Emily until 11:15, can I make it to James? Let's see. Travel time from Pacific Heights to Embarcadero is 10 minutes. If I leave at 11:15, arrive at 11:25. But James is only available until 11:30. So that gives us only 5 minutes. Not enough. So maybe can't meet James after Emily. Maybe need to adjust. Alternatively, maybe meet James before Emily? But I start at Russian Hill at 9:00. James is available from 10:30. Wait, but Emily's time starts at 9:15. So maybe first meet Emily, but then James overlaps. Hmm. Let me think. If I meet Emily from 9:15 to 11:15, then travel to Embarcadero takes 10 minutes (from Pacific Heights to Embarcadero is 10). Arrive at 11:25, but James leaves at 11:30. So only 5 minutes. Not enough. So maybe need to split Emily's time. Maybe meet Emily for part of her slot, then go to James, then come back. But that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps meet James first. Let's check. Starting at Russian Hill at 9:00. To Embarcadero is 8 minutes. So leave at 9:00, arrive 9:08. James is available from 10:30. So can't meet him before 10:30. So that's a problem. So maybe the only way to meet James is during his 10:30-11:30 window, but overlapping with Emily's meeting. So maybe meet Emily from 9:15-10:15 (60 minutes), then leave for James. Travel time from Pacific Heights to Embarcadero is 10 minutes. Arrive at 10:25. Wait, but Emily's meeting would end at 10:15, leave, arrive 10:25, but James starts at 10:30. Wait, no. If the meeting with Emily ends at 10:15, travel time 10 minutes, arrive at 10:25. Then James is available from 10:30. So wait until 10:30, meet him for 30 minutes until 11:00. Then go back to Emily. But Emily's slot ends at 1:45. So after meeting James from 10:30-11:00, go back to Pacific Heights. Travel time from Embarcadero to Pacific Heights is 11 minutes (Embarcadero to Pacific Heights is 11). So leave at 11:00, arrive 11:11. Then meet Emily from 11:11 to 1:45? But she needs a total of 120 minutes. So if first part was 9:15-10:15 (60), then second part 11:11-1:11 (120?), but total would be 60 + 120 = 180, which is more than needed. Wait, but the minimum is 120. So maybe that's overkill, but maybe possible. Alternatively, Emily's total available time is from 9:15 to 1:45, which is 4.5 hours. So maybe split into two parts. But this seems complicated and might take too much time. Alternatively, maybe miss James. Because meeting him would require cutting into Emily's time, and if it's not possible to meet the minimums, then perhaps skip him. Let's check the priorities. The user wants to meet as many friends as possible, but each has a minimum time. So we need to meet as many as possible, fulfilling the minimums. James requires 30 minutes. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe after Emily's meeting. Let's see: Emily's meeting ends at 11:15 (if we meet her for 2 hours from 9:15-11:15), then travel to Embarcadero in 10 minutes (arrive 11:25), but James is only available until 11:30. So from 11:25 to 11:30 is 5 minutes. Not enough. So James can't be met. So maybe he's not possible. Then we have to skip James.\n\nAlternatively, after Emily's meeting, what's next? Let's look at other people. Nancy is at Alamo Square from 8:30 AM to 1:45 PM, needs 120 minutes. Since we start at Russian Hill at 9:00, perhaps after meeting Emily, go to Nancy. Wait, but Nancy's available until 1:45. So if Emily's meeting is until 11:15, then from 11:15, travel to Alamo Square. From Pacific Heights to Alamo Square is 10 minutes (travel time). So arrive at 11:25. Then meet Nancy from 11:25 to 1:25 (120 minutes). But Nancy's available until 1:45. That works. Then, after that, we have Helen at North Beach from 1:45 PM to 6:45 PM, needs 30 minutes. So leaving Alamo Square at 1:25, travel to North Beach. Alamo Square to North Beach is 15 minutes. Arrive at 1:40. But Helen starts at 1:45. So wait until 1:45. Meet her from 1:45 to 2:15 (30 minutes). Then next, Paul at Fisherman's Wharf from 2:45 PM to 6:45 PM, needs 90 minutes. So after Helen, go to Fisherman's Wharf. North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf is 5 minutes. So start at 2:15 + 5 minutes travel, arrive 2:20. But Paul's available from 2:45. So wait until 2:45. Then meet until 4:15 (90 minutes). Then next, Margaret at Richmond District from 3:15 PM to 6:15 PM, needs 45 minutes. But overlapping with Paul's time. So maybe after Paul's meeting, go to Margaret. Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District is 18 minutes. So leave at 4:15, arrive at 4:33. Meet Margaret from 4:33 to 5:18 (45 mins). Then, next William at Bayview from 5:30 PM to 8:30 PM, needs 120 minutes. So leave Richmond District at 5:18, travel to Bayview. Richmond District to Bayview is 27 minutes. Arrive at 5:45. Then meet William from 5:45 to 7:45 (120 mins). Then Kimberly at Golden Gate Park from 6:45 PM to 9:15 PM, needs 75 minutes. But William's meeting ends at 7:45. Then travel from Bayview to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes. Arrive at 8:07. But Kimberly's available until 9:15. So meet from 8:07 to 9:22, but that's 75 minutes. However, Kimberly's time ends at 9:15, so the meeting would have to end at 9:15. So 8:07 to 9:15 is 68 minutes, which is less than 75. Not enough. So this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe adjust the schedule to meet Kimberly earlier. Let's see. Let's check other possibilities.\n\nWait, let's track the schedule again:\n\nStart at Russian Hill 9:00 AM.\n\nMeet Emily at Pacific Heights 9:15-11:15 (120 mins). Then go to Alamo Square to meet Nancy. Travel time 10 mins (from Pacific Heights to Alamo Square). Arrive 11:25. Meet Nancy 11:25-13:25 (120 mins). Then go to North Beach to meet Helen. Travel 15 mins (Alamo Square to North Beach). Arrive 13:40. Helen is available from 13:45. So meet 13:45-14:15 (30 mins). Then to Fisherman's Wharf. Travel 5 mins (North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf). Arrive 14:20. Paul is available from 14:45. Wait until 14:45, meet until 16:15 (90 mins). Then to Richmond District. Travel 18 mins. Arrive 16:33. Meet Margaret 16:33-17:18 (45 mins). Then to Bayview. Travel 27 mins. Arrive 17:45. Meet William 17:45-19:45 (120 mins). Then to Golden Gate Park. Travel 22 mins. Arrive 20:07. Kimberly is available until 21:15. Need 75 mins. 20:07 to 21:15 is 68 mins. Not enough. So can't meet Kimberly. Hmm. So that's a problem. So maybe need to adjust somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Paul, skip Margaret and go to William. Let's see: Paul ends at 16:15. Then travel to Bayview. Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26 mins. So arrive 16:41. Meet William from 16:41 to 18:41 (120 mins). Then from Bayview to Golden Gate Park is 22 mins. Arrive 19:03. Meet Kimberly from 19:03 to 20:18 (75 mins). But Kimberly is available until 21:15. So that works (19:03-20:18 is 75 mins). Then that allows meeting Kimberly. But then Margaret is skipped. So in this case, Margaret is missed but Kimberly is met. But Margaret requires 45 mins, Kimberly requires 75. So total people met would be Emily, Nancy, Helen, Paul, William, Kimberly. That's 6 people. But if we include Margaret, that's 7. So which is better? Let's see. Alternatively, maybe adjust the schedule to include Margaret and Kimberly.\n\nAlternative approach: After meeting Paul at Fisherman's Wharf until 16:15, go to Margaret. Travel time 18 mins to Richmond District, arrive 16:33. Meet until 17:18 (45 mins). Then go to Bayview: Richmond to Bayview is 27 mins, arrive 17:45. Meet William until 19:45. Then to Golden Gate Park, 22 mins, arrive 20:07. Meet Kimberly until 21:15 (68 mins, which is less than 75). So not possible. So in this case, Kimberly's time isn't met. Alternatively, leave William early to meet Kimberly. Let's say meet William from 17:45-19:15 (90 mins instead of 120). Then leave at 19:15, travel to Golden Gate Park (22 mins, arrive 19:37). Meet Kimberly from 19:37-20:52 (75 mins). Kimberly's available until 21:15. That works. But William's minimum is 120, so that's not acceptable. So can't do that. So perhaps have to choose between Margaret and Kimberly. Which one is possible. Since Kimberly's time is longer and requires more time, maybe better to prioritize her. But the user wants to meet as many as possible. So maybe the optimal is to meet Emily, Nancy, Helen, Paul, Margaret, William, and Kimberly. Wait, but that's not possible because the time conflicts. Let's think again.\n\nWait, maybe after Margaret, go to William. Let's see: Margaret ends at 17:18. Travel to Bayview (27 mins from Richmond District). Arrive 17:45. Meet William until 19:45 (120 mins). Then to Kimberly. Travel 22 mins, arrive 20:07. Meet until 21:15 (68 mins). Not enough. So Kimberly's minimum is 75. So not met. So can't. So perhaps better to skip Margaret and meet Kimberly. So, after Paul, go to Bayview: Paul ends at 16:15. Travel to Bayview (26 mins). Arrive 16:41. Meet William until 18:41 (120 mins). Then to Golden Gate Park (22 mins). Arrive 19:03. Meet Kimberly until 20:18 (75 mins). That works. Then Kimberly is met. So in this case, Margaret is skipped. So total people met: Emily, Nancy, Helen, Paul, William, Kimberly. That's 6. Alternatively, can we fit Margaret in between Paul and William?\n\nPaul ends at 16:15. Go to Margaret: Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District is 18 mins. Arrive 16:33. Meet until 17:18 (45 mins). Then to Bayview: 27 mins. Arrive 17:45. Meet until 19:45. Then to Kimberly. 22 mins. Arrive 20:07. Meet until 21:15 (68 mins). So Kimberly is not fully met. So if the user wants to meet as many as possible, but each must meet the minimum time, then Kimberly's 68 mins is less than 75, so it's invalid. So in that case, this schedule doesn't work. Therefore, the better option is to skip Margaret and meet Kimberly.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Start at Russian Hill 9:00.\n\n2. Emily at Pacific Heights 9:15-11:15 (120 mins).\n\n3. Travel to Alamo Square (10 mins), arrive 11:25. Meet Nancy 11:25-13:25 (120 mins).\n\n4. Travel to North Beach (15 mins), arrive 13:40. Meet Helen 13:45-14:15 (30 mins).\n\n5. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (5 mins), arrive 14:20. Wait until 14:45, meet Paul 14:45-16:15 (90 mins).\n\n6. Travel to Bayview (26 mins), arrive 16:41. Meet William 16:41-18:41 (120 mins).\n\n7. Travel to Golden Gate Park (22 mins), arrive 19:03. Meet Kimberly 19:03-20:18 (75 mins). But Kimberly's available until 21:15. Wait, 19:03 to 20:18 is 75 minutes. That works. Then Kimberly is met.\n\nIn this case, Margaret is skipped. But that's 6 people met. But what about Linda? Linda is at Haight-Ashbury from 7:30 AM to 7:15 PM, needs 15 mins. So she's available all day. So perhaps fit her in somewhere. For example, after meeting Helen, before going to Paul. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Helen at 14:15, travel to Haight-Ashbury. From North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 mins. So leave at 14:15, arrive 14:33. Meet Linda for 15 mins until 14:48. Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf. Haight-Ashbury to Fisherman's Wharf is 23 mins. Arrive at 15:11. But Paul is available from 14:45. So if we go to Linda after Helen, we'd arrive at Paul's location after 15:11, but Paul's available until 18:45. So maybe meet Paul from 15:11 to 16:41 (90 mins). That works. Then proceed as before. Let's adjust:\n\nAfter Helen (ends at 14:15), go to Linda. Travel 18 mins, arrive 14:33. Meet 14:33-14:48 (15 mins). Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf (23 mins). Arrive 15:11. Meet Paul from 15:11 to 16:41 (90 mins). Then to Bayview (26 mins, arrive 17:07. Meet William until 19:07 (120 mins). Then to Golden Gate Park (22 mins, arrive 19:29. Meet Kimberly until 20:44 (75 mins). Kimberly is available until 21:15. So 19:29-20:44 is 75 mins. That works. So now, we can include Linda. So now, the people met are Emily, Nancy, Helen, Linda, Paul, William, Kimberly. That's 7 people. But what about Anthony at Mission District from 8 AM to 2:45 PM, needs 105 mins. Let's see. Anthony's available until 2:45 PM. So after meeting Nancy until 13:25, maybe fit Anthony in before Helen. Let's try.\n\nAfter Nancy at 13:25, travel to Mission District. Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 mins (travel time from Alamo Square to Mission District is 10). Arrive 13:35. Meet Anthony from 13:35 to 15:20 (105 mins). But Anthony's available until 14:45. Wait, Anthony is available until 2:45 PM (14:45). So meeting from 13:35 to 14:45 would be 70 mins. Not enough. So can't meet Anthony's 105 mins. So maybe not possible. Alternatively, if we adjust the schedule to meet Anthony before Helen. Let's see.\n\nOriginal schedule after Nancy ends at 13:25, go to Helen (North Beach) at 13:45. But if we go to Anthony instead. From Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 mins. Arrive 13:35. Meet Anthony from 13:35 to 14:45 (70 mins). Not enough. So can't. Alternatively, skip Helen and meet Anthony. But Helen's minimum is 30 mins, Anthony's is 105. But Helen is available from 1:45 PM to 6:45 PM. So if we meet Helen later. But that complicates things. Maybe Anthony can't be met due to time constraints. So perhaps Anthony is skipped. So current schedule includes Emily, Nancy, Helen, Linda, Paul, William, Kimberly. 7 people. What about Margaret? Let's see. Can we fit Margaret in somewhere?\n\nAfter Paul ends at 16:41 (if we didn't go to Linda), but in the adjusted schedule where we met Linda, Paul ends at 16:41. Then go to Margaret. Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District is 18 mins. Arrive 16:59. Meet until 17:44 (45 mins). Then to Bayview: Richmond to Bayview is 27 mins. Arrive 18:11. Meet William until 20:11 (120 mins). Then to Golden Gate Park: 22 mins, arrive 20:33. Meet Kimberly until 21:48. But Kimberly's available until 21:15. So 20:33 to 21:15 is 42 mins. Not enough. So no. So this is tricky. So in this case, adding Margaret would mean Kimberly can't be met. So best to prioritize Kimberly over Margaret. So current plan with Linda, Paul, William, Kimberly, Emily, Nancy, Helen. 7 people. That's better.\n\nBut wait, in the adjusted schedule after meeting Helen, we met Linda, then Paul. Then William and Kimberly. Let me check the timeline again:\n\n1. Emily: 9:15-11:15\n2. Nancy: 11:25-13:25\n3. Helen: 13:45-14:15\n4. Linda: 14:33-14:48\n5. Paul: 15:11-16:41\n6. William: 17:07-19:07\n7. Kimberly: 19:29-20:44\n\nThat's 7 people. Now, check if any other people can be met. For example, James at Embarcadero from 10:30-11:30. We have Emily from 9:15-11:15. After that, leave at 11:15. Travel to Embarcadero is 10 mins. Arrive 11:25. Meet James from 11:25-11:30 (5 mins). Not enough. So James can't be met. Anthony is at Mission District until 2:45 PM. After Nancy ends at 13:25, travel to Mission District (10 mins). Arrive 13:35. Meet Anthony until 14:45 (70 mins). Not enough. So Anthony is skipped. So the maximum seems to be 7 people. \n\nNow, let's check the timeline again for accuracy:\n\n- 9:00 Arrive Russian Hill.\n- 9:15-11:15 Emily at Pacific Heights.\n- Travel to Alamo Square (10 mins), arrive 11:25.\n- 11:25-13:25 Nancy at Alamo Square.\n- Travel to North Beach (15 mins), arrive 13:40. Meet Helen 13:45-14:15.\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury (18 mins), arrive 14:33. Meet Linda 14:33-14:48.\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (23 mins), arrive 15:11. Meet Paul 15:11-16:41.\n- Travel to Bayview (26 mins), arrive 17:07. Meet William 17:07-19:07.\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park (22 mins), arrive 19:29. Meet Kimberly 19:29-20:44.\n\nNow, check all travel times:\n\n1. Russian Hill to Pacific Heights: 7 mins. Left at 9:00, arrive 9:07? But Emily is available at 9:15. So maybe the meeting starts at 9:15. The user arrives at Russian Hill at 9:00. So the first step is to go from Russian Hill to Pacific Heights. Travel time is 7 mins. So leave at 9:00, arrive at 9:07. But Emily is available from 9:15. So wait until 9:15. Then meet until 11:15. So that's correct.\n\n2. Pacific Heights to Alamo Square: 10 mins. Leave at 11:15, arrive 11:25. Correct.\n\n3. Alamo Square to North Beach: 15 mins. Leave 13:25, arrive 13:40. Correct.\n\n4. North Beach to Haight-Ashbury: 18 mins. Leave 14:15, arrive 14:33. Correct.\n\n5. Haight-Ashbury to Fisherman's Wharf: 23 mins. Leave 14:48, arrive 15:11. Correct.\n\n6. Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview: 26 mins. Leave 16:41, arrive 17:07. Correct.\n\n7. Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 mins. Leave 19:07, arrive 19:29. Correct.\n\nAll travel times seem correct. Now, check if all meetings meet the minimum times:\n\n- Emily: 120 mins \u2705\n- Nancy: 120 mins \u2705\n- Helen: 30 mins \u2705\n- Linda: 15 mins \u2705\n- Paul: 90 mins \u2705\n- William: 120 mins \u2705\n- Kimberly: 75 mins \u2705\n\nYes. So this schedule meets 7 people with their minimum times. The others (James, Anthony, Margaret) are skipped due to time conflicts. This seems to be the maximum possible.",
