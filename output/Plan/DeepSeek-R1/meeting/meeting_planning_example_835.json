            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible considering travel times and their availability. Let me start by listing all the people and their constraints.\n\nFirst, the user arrives at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM. The friends to meet are:\n\n1. Helen at Golden Gate Park from 9:30 AM to 12:15 PM (minimum 45 minutes).\n2. Deborah at Bayview from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM (min 30 min). But since the user arrives at 9:00, earliest possible is after 9:00 plus travel time. Travel time from Pacific Heights to Bayview is 22 minutes. So arrival at Bayview would be 9:22. But Deborah is available until 12 PM. Maybe possible after meeting someone else first.\n\n3. Matthew at Marina District from 9:15 AM to 2:15 PM (min 45 min). Marina is only 6 minutes from Pacific Heights. So earliest start time is 9:06 AM arrival, but user arrives at 9:00. Wait until 9:06? But Matthew's available from 9:15. So maybe start at 9:15. Let me check: leave Pacific Heights at 9:00, take 6 min to Marina, arrive 9:06. But Matthew is available from 9:15. So wait until 9:15 to meet. So meeting from 9:15 to 10:00 (45 min). Then next.\n\n4. Then Helen: Golden Gate Park is 15 minutes from Pacific Heights, but if the user is at Marina District, then from Marina to Golden Gate Park is 16 minutes. Wait, the travel times between locations. So after meeting Matthew at Marina District, travel to Golden Gate Park takes 16 minutes. If the meeting with Matthew ends at 10:00 AM, then departure at 10:00, arrive at 10:16. Helen is available until 12:15 PM. Need 45 min. So possible from 10:16 to 11:01 AM. That's 45 minutes. Then after that, check others.\n\nBut maybe start with Matthew first. Then Helen.\n\nThen, after Helen, maybe Deborah. From Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 23 minutes. If Helen ends at 11:01, leave at 11:01, arrive Bayview at 11:24. Deborah's available until 12 PM. So meet from 11:24 to 11:54 (30 min). That works. But need to check if that's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Matthew, do Deborah first. Let's see:\n\nIf user starts at Pacific Heights at 9:00. Go to Marina District (6 min), arrive 9:06. Wait until 9:15 to meet Matthew. Meet until 10:00. Then from Marina to Bayview is 27 min. So arrive at 10:27. Deborah's available until 12. Meet 30 min until 10:57. Then from Bayview to Golden Gate Park is 22 min (from Bayview to Golden Gate Park is 22). Arrive at 11:19. Helen's available until 12:15. Meet 45 min until 12:04. That's possible. But would that work?\n\nWait, but Helen's time is 9:30 AM to 12:15 PM. So meeting from 11:19 to 12:04 would be 45 min. That's within her window. So that's possible. Then after that, what's next?\n\nJoseph at Union Square from 2:15 PM to 6:45 PM (min 120). Rebecca at Financial District from 2:45 to 4:15 (min 30). Ronald at Sunset District from 4 PM to 8:45 PM (min 60). Robert at Alamo Square from 6:30 PM to 9:15 PM (min 120). Elizabeth at Mission District from 6:30 PM to 9 PM (min 120). Steven at The Castro from 8:15 PM to 10 PM (min 105).\n\nSo after Helen, the next possible is Joseph. Let's see the timeline.\n\nAfter meeting Helen until 12:04 PM. Then need to go to Joseph's location (Union Square) next. But Joseph's available from 2:15 PM. So there's time between 12:04 PM and 2:15 PM. What can we fit in that gap? Maybe Rebecca? But Rebecca is at Financial District from 2:45 PM. Hmm. Wait, maybe after Helen, go to Rebecca first? But Rebecca's time is 2:45 PM to 4:15 PM. So perhaps after Helen, the next possible is to go to Union Square for Joseph starting at 2:15 PM. Let's check the travel time from Golden Gate Park to Union Square: 22 minutes. If leave at 12:04 PM, arrive at 12:26 PM. Then there's time until 2:15 PM. Maybe that's a gap. But perhaps there's someone else to meet during that time. Let me check other friends.\n\nDeborah is already met in the earlier scenario. So other friends available during the afternoon: Joseph, Rebecca, Ronald, Robert, Elizabeth, Steven.\n\nWait, perhaps after Helen, go to Union Square for Joseph, but he's available from 2:15 PM. So need to schedule Joseph's meeting from 2:15 PM onwards. Let's think.\n\nFrom Golden Gate Park (after meeting Helen at 12:04 PM) to Union Square is 22 minutes. Arrive 12:26 PM. Then free time until 2:15 PM. But Rebecca is available from 2:45 PM. Maybe after Joseph, meet Rebecca. Joseph's meeting requires 120 minutes (2 hours). So if start at 2:15 PM, end at 4:15 PM. Then Rebecca is available until 4:15 PM. So meet Rebecca at Financial District. From Union Square to Financial District is 9 minutes (since Union Square to Financial District is 9). So if Joseph's meeting ends at 4:15 PM, then leave Union Square at 4:15, arrive Financial District at 4:24. But Rebecca's availability ends at 4:15 PM. So that's too late. Therefore, can't meet Rebecca after Joseph. So perhaps meet Rebecca before Joseph? Let's see.\n\nAlternative plan: After meeting Helen until 12:04 PM, go to Financial District to meet Rebecca. But Rebecca is available from 2:45 PM. So that's not possible. So maybe Rebecca needs to be scheduled after Joseph? But Joseph's meeting ends at 4:15 PM, which is when Rebecca's availability ends. So perhaps meet Rebecca in the time between Joseph and Ronald? Let me check.\n\nWait, Joseph's meeting is from 2:15 PM to 4:15 PM (2 hours). Then after that, from 4:15 PM, need to see Ronald at Sunset District (available from 4 PM to 8:45 PM). Travel time from Union Square to Sunset District is 27 minutes. So arrive at 4:42 PM. Meet Ronald for 60 minutes until 5:42 PM. Then next, maybe Robert or Elizabeth.\n\nRobert at Alamo Square from 6:30 PM to 9:15 PM (min 120). Elizabeth at Mission District from 6:30 PM to 9 PM (min 120). Steven at The Castro from 8:15 PM to 10 PM (min 105).\n\nAfter Ronald ends at 5:42 PM, travel to Alamo Square. From Sunset District to Alamo Square is 17 minutes. Arrive at 5:59 PM. Robert's available from 6:30 PM, so need to wait until 6:30 PM. Then meet Robert from 6:30 to 8:30 PM (2 hours). Then after that, go to The Castro to meet Steven. From Alamo Square to The Castro is 8 minutes. So arrive at 8:38 PM. Steven is available until 10 PM. Need 105 minutes (1h45m). So meet from 8:38 to 10:23 PM, but Steven's window ends at 10 PM. So can only meet until 10 PM. That's 82 minutes, which is less than required 105. So that's not enough. Alternatively, after Robert, maybe go to Elizabeth at Mission District. Robert ends at 8:30 PM. Travel to Mission District: Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 minutes. Arrive 8:40 PM. Elizabeth is available until 9 PM. Need 120 minutes, but only 20 minutes left. Not possible. So meeting Elizabeth would need to start by 7 PM at the latest (7 to 9 PM). But if after Ronald ends at 5:42 PM, perhaps go to Elizabeth first. Let's see.\n\nAfter Ronald ends at 5:42 PM, travel to Mission District. From Sunset District to Mission District is 25 minutes. So arrive at 6:07 PM. Elizabeth is available from 6:30 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM, then meet until 8:30 PM. That's 2 hours. Then after that, go to Alamo Square for Robert. Travel time from Mission District to Alamo Square is 10 minutes (Mission District to Alamo Square is 11, but according to the data, Mission District to Alamo Square is 11 minutes. So arrive at 8:41 PM. Robert's available until 9:15 PM. Meet from 8:41 to 9:15 PM. That's 34 minutes, which is less than required 120. So not possible. Alternatively, swap Robert and Elizabeth? Let's think.\n\nAfter Ronald ends at 5:42 PM, go to Alamo Square. Arrive at 5:59 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM. Meet Robert from 6:30 to 8:30 PM. Then go to Mission District for Elizabeth. Travel time from Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 minutes. Arrive 8:40 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 8:40 to 9:00 PM (20 minutes) which is not enough. So that's not possible. Alternatively, meet Elizabeth first, then Steven?\n\nWait, let's backtrack. After Joseph ends at 4:15 PM, go to Sunset District for Ronald. Travel time 27 minutes, arrive 4:42 PM. Meet until 5:42 PM. Then next, could we fit in Rebecca? But Rebecca's window is 2:45 to 4:15 PM. Joseph's meeting ends at 4:15 PM, which is when Rebecca's window closes. So no. So Rebecca can't be scheduled if we do Joseph from 2:15 to 4:15 PM. So perhaps need to adjust Joseph's meeting to end earlier to allow time for Rebecca. Let's see. Suppose meet Joseph from 2:15 PM to 3:45 PM (90 minutes), but he needs 120. So that's not enough. Alternatively, split the time. Maybe meet Joseph from 2:15 to 4:15 (120), then Rebecca's window is already closed. So Rebecca can't be met in this plan. Alternatively, maybe meet Rebecca first before Joseph. If Rebecca's available from 2:45 PM, and Joseph from 2:15 PM. So if we schedule Rebecca from 2:45 to 3:15 PM (30 min), then go to Joseph. But Joseph starts at 2:15 PM. So maybe schedule Joseph from 3:15 PM onwards. Let's check.\n\nAfter Helen ends at 12:04 PM, the user has time until 2:15 PM. Suppose the user goes to Financial District to meet Rebecca. From Golden Gate Park to Financial District is 26 minutes. So leave at 12:04 PM, arrive at 12:30 PM. Rebecca isn't available until 2:45 PM. So that's a long wait. Not feasible. Alternatively, after meeting Helen, go somewhere else. Maybe Deborah, but already met her in the earlier scenario. Or other options? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another schedule. Maybe start with Deborah first.\n\nUser arrives at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM. Travel to Bayview takes 22 minutes, arriving at 9:22 AM. Deborah is available until 12 PM. Meet her from 9:22 to 9:52 AM (30 min). Then travel to Marina District. Bayview to Marina District is 27 minutes. Arrive at 10:19 AM. Matthew is available until 2:15 PM. Meet from 10:19 AM to 11:04 AM (45 min). Then travel to Golden Gate Park (Marina to Golden Gate Park is 16 min). Arrive at 11:20 AM. Meet Helen from 11:20 AM to 12:05 PM (45 min). Then next, go to Union Square for Joseph. Golden Gate Park to Union Square is 22 minutes. Arrive at 12:27 PM. Joseph's available from 2:15 PM. So that leaves time from 12:27 PM to 2:15 PM. Could we meet Rebecca here? Rebecca is available from 2:45 PM. Not overlapping. So user would have to wait until 2:15 PM to meet Joseph. Then meet Joseph from 2:15 to 4:15 PM. Then after that, Rebecca's window is closed. So again, can't meet Rebecca. Then proceed to Ronald at Sunset District, etc.\n\nBut this schedule includes Deborah, Matthew, Helen, Joseph, Ronald, Robert/Steven/Elizabeth. But perhaps more people than the previous plan. Let's count.\n\nFirst scenario: Matthew, Helen, Deborah, Joseph, Ronald, Robert, and maybe Steven or Elizabeth. But in the first scenario, after Joseph, Ronald, then Robert, but Steven can't be met. Or Elizabeth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal path is to maximize the number of people met. Let's list all friends:\n\nHelen, Steven, Deborah, Matthew, Joseph, Ronald, Robert, Rebecca, Elizabeth. That's 9 people. But some time windows overlap, and travel times may limit.\n\nThe constraints:\n\n- Must meet Helen for 45 min between 9:30 AM and 12:15 PM.\n\n- Steven from 8:15 PM to 10 PM, needs 105 min.\n\n- Deborah until 12 PM.\n\n- Matthew until 2:15 PM.\n\n- Joseph from 2:15 PM to 6:45 PM, needs 2h.\n\n- Ronald from 4 PM to 8:45 PM, needs 1h.\n\n- Robert from 6:30 PM to 9:15 PM, needs 2h.\n\n- Rebecca from 2:45 PM to 4:15 PM, needs 30 min.\n\n- Elizabeth from 6:30 PM to 9 PM, needs 2h.\n\nThe challenge is to fit as many as possible. Let's think step by step.\n\nMorning (starting at 9 AM):\n\nOption 1: Start with Matthew (Marina District). Arrive at 9:06 AM, but wait until 9:15 AM to meet. Meet until 10:00 AM. Then travel to Golden Gate Park (16 min) arrive 10:16 AM. Meet Helen until 11:01 AM. Then travel to Bayview (23 min) arrive 11:24 AM. Meet Deborah until 11:54 AM. Then travel to Union Square (Bayview to Union Square is 18 min? Wait, the travel times: Bayview to Union Square is 18 minutes. So arrive at 12:12 PM. Then free until Joseph's availability at 2:15 PM. Could this time be used for Rebecca? Rebecca is available from 2:45 PM. So after Union Square, maybe go to Financial District. But from Union Square to Financial District is 9 minutes. So from 12:12 PM to 2:15 PM, there's 2h3m. Not enough for Rebecca's window. So perhaps no.\n\nThen, Joseph from 2:15 PM to 4:15 PM. Then to Sunset District (27 min) arrive 4:42 PM. Meet Ronald until 5:42 PM. Then to Alamo Square (17 min) arrive 5:59 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM. Meet Robert until 8:30 PM. Then travel to The Castro (8 min) arrive 8:38 PM. Meet Steven until 10 PM (but need 105 min). 8:38 PM to 10 PM is 1h22m, which is 82 minutes. Not enough. So can't meet Steven. Alternatively, after Robert, go to Elizabeth. From Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 min. Arrive 8:40 PM. Meet until 9 PM. Only 20 minutes. Not enough. So this plan includes Matthew, Helen, Deborah, Joseph, Ronald, Robert. 6 people. But missing Rebecca, Steven, Elizabeth.\n\nOption 2: After meeting Joseph until 4:15 PM, go to Rebecca. But Rebecca's window ends at 4:15 PM. So if Joseph ends at 4:15, no time. So Rebecca must be scheduled earlier.\n\nAlternative plan: After meeting Helen, go to Rebecca before Joseph. For example, after meeting Helen at Golden Gate Park until 12:05 PM, travel to Financial District. Golden Gate Park to Financial District is 26 minutes. Arrive 12:31 PM. But Rebecca is available from 2:45 PM. So have to wait until 2:45 PM. That's 2h14m waiting. Not feasible. So maybe Rebecca can't be scheduled in this case.\n\nAnother option: Meet Joseph for 2 hours, but starting a bit later to allow time for Rebecca. For example, meet Joseph from 2:45 PM to 4:45 PM (but he's available until 6:45 PM). But Rebecca's window is 2:45 to 4:15 PM. So if we meet Rebecca first: after 2:45 PM. So after Helen, Deborah, etc., maybe:\n\nAfter Helen ends at 12:05 PM, go to Union Square (22 min) arrive 12:27 PM. Then wait until 2:45 PM to go to Rebecca. Travel to Financial District (9 min) arrive 2:54 PM. Meet Rebecca until 3:24 PM. Then go back to Joseph at Union Square (9 min) arrive 3:33 PM. Meet Joseph from 3:33 PM to 5:33 PM (2 hours). Then go to Ronald at Sunset District (27 min) arrive 6:00 PM. Meet until 7:00 PM. Then go to Alamo Square (17 min) arrive 7:17 PM. Robert's available from 6:30 PM. So meet from 7:17 PM to 9:17 PM, but Robert's window ends at 9:15 PM. So adjust to 7:17 PM to 9:15 PM (1h58m, close enough but still 118 minutes, which is under 120. Not enough). Alternatively, meet Elizabeth. From Sunset District to Mission District is 25 min. Arrive 6:25 PM. But Ronald's meeting ends at 7:00 PM. So if Ronald ends at 7:00 PM, leave to Mission District (25 min) arrive 7:25 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 7:25 PM to 9:25 PM, but she's only available until 9 PM. So that's 1h35m. Not enough. Alternatively, after Joseph ends at 5:33 PM, go to Ronald at 6:00 PM (if travel time is 27 min, arrive at 6:00 PM). Meet until 7:00 PM. Then go to Alamo Square (17 min) arrive 7:17 PM. Meet Robert until 9:15 PM (118 min). Then go to The Castro (8 min) arrive 9:23 PM. Steven is available until 10 PM. Meet from 9:23 PM to 10:00 PM (37 min). Not enough. \n\nThis plan includes Rebecca, Joseph, Ronald, Robert. But missing others.\n\nAlternatively, prioritize meeting Steven and Elizabeth. Let's see.\n\nAfter Joseph ends at 4:15 PM, go to Ronald (Sunset District) until 5:42 PM. Then go to Mission District to meet Elizabeth. From Sunset District to Mission District is 25 min. Arrive 6:07 PM. Meet from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM. Then go to The Castro (7 min) arrive 8:37 PM. Meet Steven until 10 PM (83 min). But Steven requires 105. Not enough. Alternatively, leave Elizabeth earlier. If meet Elizabeth from 6:30 to 8:30 PM, then go to Steven. Travel time from Mission District to The Castro is 7 min. Arrive 8:37 PM. Meet until 10 PM (83 min). Still not enough.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to see which friends can be met with minimal overlap and travel.\n\nPossible approach:\n\n- Morning: Meet Matthew (Marina) 9:15-10:00, Helen (Golden Gate) 10:16-11:01, Deborah (Bayview) 11:24-11:54.\n\n- Afternoon: Joseph (Union) 2:15-4:15.\n\n- Rebecca (Financial) not possible.\n\n- Ronald (Sunset) 4:42-5:42.\n\n- Evening: Robert (Alamo) 6:30-8:30, then Elizabeth (Mission) 8:40-9:00 (insufficient), or Steven (Castro) 8:38-10:00 (insufficient).\n\nThis gives 6 people: Matthew, Helen, Deborah, Joseph, Ronald, Robert. Can we fit Rebecca in?\n\nAlternative plan: Meet Joseph from 2:15-4:15, then Rebecca from 4:15. But Rebecca's window ends at 4:15. So not possible. If we split Joseph's time: meet him from 2:15-3:45 (90 min), then go to Rebecca (Financial District) from 3:54-4:24 (30 min). Then go to Ronald (Sunset) from 4:24, travel 27 min, arrive 4:51 PM. Meet until 5:51 PM. Then proceed to Robert and/or Elizabeth.\n\nBut Joseph's minimum is 120 min, so cutting him short is not allowed. So that's invalid.\n\nAnother idea: Meet Rebecca after Helen but before Joseph. For example, after Helen ends at 11:01 AM, travel to Financial District (26 min) arrive 11:27 AM. But Rebecca's available from 2:45 PM. So can't. No.\n\nSo Rebecca might not be possible to fit. So maximum 6 people. But maybe another arrangement.\n\nAnother option: Skip Deborah to fit more others. For example, after Matthew and Helen, go to Joseph, then Ronald, then Elizabeth and Steven.\n\nMatthew (9:15-10:00), Helen (10:16-11:01). Then travel to Union Square (22 min) arrive 11:23 AM. Free until 2:15 PM. Maybe meet someone else. But available friends during this time: none. Joseph starts at 2:15. So wait until then. Meet Joseph 2:15-4:15. Then Ronald 4:42-5:42. Then Elizabeth 6:07-8:07 (but arrives at 6:07 PM, which is after her start time of 6:30 PM. Wait until 6:30, meet until 8:30. Then Steven from 8:37 PM to 10:00 PM (83 min). So 7 people: Matthew, Helen, Joseph, Ronald, Elizabeth, Steven. But Steven's time is insufficient. Alternatively, meet Robert instead of Elizabeth. After Ronald ends at 5:42 PM, go to Alamo Square (17 min) arrive 5:59 PM. Meet Robert 6:30-8:30 PM. Then Steven 8:38-10 PM (82 min). So that's 6 people. But Elizabeth is missed.\n\nAlternatively, after Ronald ends at 5:42 PM, go to Mission District for Elizabeth (25 min) arrive 6:07 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM, meet until 8:30 PM. Then travel to The Castro (7 min) arrive 8:37 PM. Meet Steven until 10 PM (83 min). So meet 7 people (Matthew, Helen, Joseph, Ronald, Elizabeth, Steven) but Steven's time is short. However, the problem states to meet as many as possible, but also meet the minimum required time. If the minimum isn't met, the meeting can't be scheduled. So Steven needs 105 min, but only 83 available. So can't meet him. So this plan can't include Steven.\n\nAlternatively, meet Robert instead of Elizabeth. Robert from 6:30-8:30 PM. Then Steven from 8:38-10 PM (82 min). Still not enough. So Steven can't be met.\n\nThus, the optimal schedule might include Matthew, Helen, Joseph, Ronald, Robert, and possibly Deborah or Rebecca.\n\nBut Deborah can be met in the morning, adding her to the list.\n\nSo initial plan:\n\nMatthew 9:15-10:00 AM.\n\nHelen 10:16-11:01 AM.\n\nDeborah 11:24-11:54 AM.\n\nJoseph 2:15-4:15 PM.\n\nRonald 4:42-5:42 PM.\n\nRobert 6:30-8:30 PM.\n\nTotal of 6 people. Rebecca, Elizabeth, Steven can't be met.\n\nAnother option: Skip Deborah to fit in Rebecca. For example:\n\nAfter Helen ends at 11:01 AM, travel to Financial District (26 min) arrive 11:27 AM. Rebecca is available from 2:45 PM. Can't meet her yet. So no. So Rebecca is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after Joseph ends at 4:15 PM, go to Rebecca's location, but her window is closed.\n\nThus, Rebecca can't be included.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe meet Robert and Elizabeth in the evening, but their windows overlap. Robert needs 120 min from 6:30 PM to 9:15 PM. Elizabeth needs 120 min from 6:30 PM to 9 PM. So choose one. If we meet Robert from 6:30-8:30 PM, then travel to Mission District (10 min) arrive 8:40 PM. Elizabeth's window ends at 9 PM. Can only meet 20 min. Not enough. If meet Elizabeth from 6:30-8:30 PM, then travel to Alamo Square (10 min) arrive 8:40 PM. Robert's available until 9:15 PM. Meet until 9:15 PM (35 min). Not enough. So can't meet both. Choose one.\n\nIf we prioritize Elizabeth, then after meeting her, can't meet Robert. If we prioritize Robert, then can't meet Elizabeth. But Steven is also available later. So perhaps meet Robert, then Steven.\n\nRobert from 6:30-8:30 PM. Travel to The Castro (8 min) arrive 8:38 PM. Meet Steven until 10 PM (82 min). Not enough. So no.\n\nAlternatively, meet Elizabeth from 6:30-8:30 PM, then go to The Castro (7 min) arrive 8:37 PM. Meet Steven until 10 PM (83 min). Still not enough.\n\nSo it's impossible to meet Steven.\n\nThus, the maximum possible is 6 people: Matthew, Helen, Deborah, Joseph, Ronald, Robert.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the morning schedule.\n\nAfter Matthew ends at 10:00 AM, travel to Golden Gate Park (16 min) arrive 10:16 AM. Meet Helen until 11:01 AM. Then travel to Bayview (23 min) arrive 11:24 AM. Meet Deborah until 11:54 AM. Then travel to Union Square (18 min from Bayview to Union Square) arrive 12:12 PM. Then have 2 hours until Joseph's availability at 2:15 PM. Can we fit Rebecca here? No, Rebecca is available from 2:45 PM. So no.\n\nSo this plan includes 6 people. Another possibility: Skip Deborah to fit in Elizabeth or Steven. For example:\n\nMatthew, Helen, Joseph, Ronald, Robert, and Elizabeth. But how?\n\nAfter Helen ends at 11:01 AM, travel to Union Square (22 min) arrive 11:23 AM. Wait until 2:15 PM. Meet Joseph until 4:15 PM. Then Ronald until 5:42 PM. Then go to Mission District (25 min) arrive 6:07 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM. Meet Elizabeth until 8:30 PM. Then go to Alamo Square (10 min) arrive 8:40 PM. Meet Robert until 9:15 PM (35 min). Not enough. So Robert can't be met. So this plan includes Matthew, Helen, Joseph, Ronald, Elizabeth. 5 people. Which is worse than the previous plan.\n\nThus, the best is the first plan with 6 people: Matthew, Helen, Deborah, Joseph, Ronald, Robert.\n\nBut let's verify travel times and overlaps.\n\nCheck each step:\n\n1. Pacific Heights to Marina District: 6 min. Arrive 9:06 AM. Wait until 9:15 AM. Meet Matthew 9:15-10:00 AM.\n\n2. Marina District to Golden Gate Park: 16 min. Depart 10:00, arrive 10:16 AM. Meet Helen 10:16-11:01 AM.\n\n3. Golden Gate Park to Bayview: 23 min. Depart 11:01, arrive 11:24 AM. Meet Deborah 11:24-11:54 AM.\n\n4. Bayview to Union Square: 18 min. Depart 11:54, arrive 12:12 PM. Wait until 2:15 PM. Meet Joseph 2:15-4:15 PM.\n\n5. Union Square to Sunset District: 27 min. Depart 4:15, arrive 4:42 PM. Meet Ronald 4:42-5:42 PM.\n\n6. Sunset District to Alamo Square: 17 min. Depart 5:42, arrive 5:59 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM. Meet Robert 6:30-8:30 PM.\n\n7. Alamo Square to The Castro: 8 min. Depart 8:30, arrive 8:38 PM. Meet Steven 8:38-10:00 PM (82 min). Not enough. So Steven can't be met.\n\nThus, this plan includes Matthew, Helen, Deborah, Joseph, Ronald, Robert. Six people.\n\nIs there a way to include Elizabeth instead of Robert?\n\nAfter step 5: Ronald ends at 5:42 PM. Travel to Mission District: 25 min. Arrive 6:07 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM. Meet Elizabeth 6:30-8:30 PM. Then travel to The Castro (7 min) arrive 8:37 PM. Meet Steven until 10 PM (83 min). Still insufficient.\n\nSo including Elizabeth and Steven is not possible.\n\nThus, the optimal schedule is 6 people: Matthew, Helen, Deborah, Joseph, Ronald, Robert.\n\nAlternatively, another possible schedule:\n\nMeet Matthew 9:15-10:00 AM.\n\nThen Helen 10:16-11:01 AM.\n\nThen travel to Union Square (22 min) arrive 11:23 AM. Wait until 2:15 PM. Meet Joseph 2:15-4:15 PM.\n\nThen Rebecca: from Union Square to Financial District (9 min) arrive 4:24 PM. Rebecca's window ends at 4:15 PM. Can't meet.\n\nThus, Rebecca can't be included.\n\nAnother option: Meet Deborah in the morning:\n\nStart at Pacific Heights 9:00 AM. Travel to Bayview (22 min) arrive 9:22 AM. Meet Deborah 9:22-9:52 AM. Then travel to Marina District (27 min) arrive 10:19 AM. Meet Matthew 10:19-11:04 AM. Then to Golden Gate Park (16 min) arrive 11:20 AM. Meet Helen 11:20-12:05 PM. Then to Union Square (22 min) arrive 12:27 PM. Wait until 2:15 PM. Meet Joseph until 4:15 PM. Then to Sunset District (27 min) arrive 4:42 PM. Meet Ronald until 5:42 PM. Then to Alamo Square (17 min) arrive 5:59 PM. Meet Robert 6:30-8:30 PM. Then to The Castro (8 min) arrive 8:38 PM. Meet Steven until 10:00 PM (82 min). Not enough. So same as before.\n\nThus, same number of people.\n\nSo the final itinerary would include:\n\n1. Matthew at Marina District 9:15-10:00.\n\n2. Helen at Golden Gate Park 10:16-11:01.\n\n3. Deborah at Bayview 11:24-11:54.\n\n4. Joseph at Union Square 2:15-4:15.\n\n5. Ronald at Sunset District 4:42-5:42.\n\n6. Robert at Alamo Square 6:30-8:30.\n\nThis meets six friends. Rebecca, Elizabeth, and Steven cannot be scheduled due to time constraints.\n\nNow, I need to verify all travel times and ensure no overlaps.\n\nCheck the timeline:\n\n- 9:00 AM arrive at Pacific Heights.\n\n- 9:00 AM depart to Marina District (6 min), arrive 9:06. Wait until 9:15. Meet Matthew 9:15-10:00.\n\n- 10:00 depart to Golden Gate Park (16 min), arrive 10:16. Meet Helen until 11:01.\n\n- 11:01 depart to Bayview (23 min), arrive 11:24. Meet Deborah until 11:54.\n\n- 11:54 depart to Union Square (18 min), arrive 12:12. Wait until 2:15.\n\n- 2:15 meet Joseph until 4:15.\n\n- 4:15 depart to Sunset District (27 min), arrive 4:42. Meet Ronald until 5:42.\n\n- 5:42 depart to Alamo Square (17 min), arrive 5:59. Wait until 6:30. Meet Robert until 8:30.\n\n- 8:30 depart to The Castro (8 min), arrive 8:38. Meet Steven until 10:00 (82 min), which is not enough. So Steven is not included.\n\nThus, the final itinerary includes six people. All meetings meet the minimum required duration, and travel times are accounted for.",
