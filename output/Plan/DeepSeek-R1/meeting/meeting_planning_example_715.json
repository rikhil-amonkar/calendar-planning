            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule meetings with as many friends as possible in San Francisco, starting from Presidio at 9:00 AM. The constraints are pretty tight with specific time windows and minimum meeting durations. Let me start by listing all the people and their availability along with the required meeting times.\n\nFirst, the people and their locations, availability, and minimum durations:\n\n- Amanda: Marina District, 2:45 PM to 7:30 PM, needs 105 minutes (1h45m)\n- Melissa: The Castro, 9:30 AM to 5 PM, 30 minutes\n- Jeffrey: Fisherman's Wharf, 12:45 PM to 6:45 PM, 120 minutes (2h)\n- Matthew: Bayview, 10:15 AM to 1:15 PM, 30 minutes\n- Nancy: Pacific Heights, 5 PM to 9:30 PM, 105 minutes\n- Karen: Mission District, 5:30 PM to 8:30 PM, 105 minutes\n- Robert: Alamo Square, 11:15 AM to 5:30 PM, 120 minutes (2h)\n- Joseph: Golden Gate Park, 8:30 AM to 9:15 PM, 105 minutes\n\nStarting at Presidio at 9 AM. Let's map out possible sequences considering travel times.\n\nFirst, since Joseph is available all day at Golden Gate Park (from 8:30 AM), but we start at Presidio at 9 AM. The travel time from Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 12 minutes. So earliest arrival is 9:12 AM. Joseph needs 105 minutes. If we meet Joseph first, maybe 9:12 AM start, but he's available all day. But maybe we can slot him in later when others aren't available.\n\nMatthew in Bayview is available from 10:15 AM to 1:15 PM. He's the earliest available after the start. Let's check the travel time from Presidio to Bayview: 31 minutes. So leaving Presidio at 9 AM, arriving Bayview at 9:31 AM. But Matthew isn't available until 10:15 AM. So there's a gap here. Alternatively, maybe go somewhere else first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Melissa in The Castro. Presidio to The Castro is 21 minutes. So arrive at 9:21 AM. Melissa is available from 9:30 AM. So start at 9:30 AM, meet for 30 minutes until 10:00 AM. Then go to Bayview. The Castro to Bayview is 19 minutes. So leave The Castro at 10:00 AM, arrive Bayview at 10:19 AM. Matthew's available until 1:15 PM, so meet from 10:19 AM to 10:49 AM (30 minutes). Then go to next location.\n\nAfter that, maybe head to Robert in Alamo Square. Bayview to Alamo Square is 16 minutes. Arrive at 11:05 AM. Robert is available from 11:15 AM. So wait until 11:15 AM. Need to meet Robert for 120 minutes, which would end at 1:15 PM. Then next, perhaps Jeffrey in Fisherman's Wharf. Alamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf is 19 minutes. So leave at 1:15 PM, arrive at 1:34 PM. Jeffrey's available until 6:45 PM. Need 120 minutes, so meet from 1:34 PM to 3:34 PM. Then, after that, head to Amanda in Marina District. Fisherman's Wharf to Marina District is 10 minutes. So arrive at 3:44 PM. Amanda is available from 2:45 PM. So 3:44 PM is within her window. Need to meet for 105 minutes, ending at 5:29 PM. Then, next, Nancy in Pacific Heights. Marina District to Pacific Heights is 7 minutes. Arrive at 5:36 PM. Nancy is available from 5 PM. Her minimum is 105 minutes, so meet from 5:36 PM to 7:21 PM. Then, Karen in Mission District. Pacific Heights to Mission District is 15 minutes. Arrive at 7:36 PM. Karen is available until 8:30 PM. Need 105 minutes, but 8:30 PM minus 7:36 PM is 54 minutes, which isn't enough. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe adjust the order.\n\nAlternatively, after Amanda, go to Karen. Marina District to Mission District is 20 minutes. Arrive at 5:29 PM +20 = 5:49 PM. Karen is available from 5:30 PM. So meet from 5:49 PM to 7:34 PM (105 minutes). Then go to Nancy. Mission District to Pacific Heights is 16 minutes. Arrive at 7:50 PM. Nancy's available until 9:30 PM. Meet from 7:50 PM to 9:35 PM, but Nancy's window ends at 9:30 PM. So end at 9:30 PM. That's 100 minutes, which is less than the required 105. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe switch Karen and Nancy. Let's see: after Amanda ends at 5:29 PM, go to Nancy in Pacific Heights (7 minutes travel). Arrive at 5:36 PM. Meet Nancy from 5:36 PM to 7:21 PM (105 minutes). Then go to Karen: Pacific Heights to Mission District is 15 minutes. Arrive at 7:36 PM. Karen's available until 8:30 PM. So meet until 8:30 PM. That's 54 minutes, which isn't enough. So Karen can't be met in this case. Alternatively, maybe we need to prioritize Karen over Nancy. But both require 105 minutes. But Karen's window is from 5:30 PM to 8:30 PM, while Nancy is 5 PM to 9:30 PM. Maybe if we meet Karen first, then Nancy. Let's see: Amanda ends at 5:29 PM. Go to Karen: 20 minutes to Mission District, arrive 5:49 PM. Meet until 7:34 PM (105 minutes). Then Nancy: Mission District to Pacific Heights is 16 minutes, arrive 7:50 PM. Meet from 7:50 PM to 9:35 PM, but Nancy's window ends at 9:30 PM. So that's 100 minutes. Still not enough. So maybe Nancy can't be met here. Alternatively, perhaps adjust the schedule.\n\nWait, maybe the initial plan with Robert is taking up too much time. Let me check again. Meeting Robert from 11:15 AM to 1:15 PM (2 hours). Then Jeffrey from 1:34 PM to 3:34 PM. Then Amanda until 5:29 PM. Then Nancy until 7:21 PM. Then Karen until 8:30 PM (but only 54 minutes). So Karen's minimum is 105, which can't be met. So Karen can't be included. Alternatively, maybe adjust the order of meetings to fit Karen in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Jeffrey, go to Joseph at Golden Gate Park. Let's see. Jeffrey ends at 3:34 PM. Travel to Golden Gate Park from Fisherman's Wharf: 25 minutes. Arrive 3:59 PM. Joseph needs 105 minutes. So meet until 5:44 PM. Then go to Amanda. Golden Gate Park to Marina District is 16 minutes. Arrive at 6:00 PM. Amanda's available until 7:30 PM. 105 minutes would be until 7:45 PM, but she's only there until 7:30 PM. So that's 1.5 hours (90 minutes), which is less than the required 105. So Amanda can't be met then. Alternatively, maybe meet Amanda first after Jeffrey. Let's see: Jeffrey ends at 3:34 PM. Go to Marina District (10 minutes) arriving 3:44 PM. Meet Amanda until 5:29 PM. Then go to Golden Gate Park (18 minutes) arriving 5:47 PM. Meet Joseph until 7:32 PM (105 minutes). Then, Karen: Golden Gate Park to Mission District is 17 minutes. Arrive 7:49 PM. Karen's available until 8:30 PM. Meet until 8:30 PM (41 minutes). Not enough. Alternatively, after Amanda, go to Karen. Marina District to Mission District is 20 minutes. Arrive 5:49 PM. Meet until 7:34 PM (105). Then Nancy: Mission District to Pacific Heights is 16 minutes. Arrive 7:50 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM (100 minutes). Not enough. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe Robert's meeting can be adjusted. If instead of meeting Robert from 11:15 AM to 1:15 PM, perhaps find a shorter time? No, the minimum is 120 minutes. So that's required. So that's fixed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meet Joseph in Golden Gate Park first. Let's see. Starting at Presidio at 9 AM. Travel to Golden Gate Park (12 min), arrive 9:12 AM. Meet Joseph from 9:12 AM to 10:57 AM (105 minutes). Then go to Matthew in Bayview. Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 23 minutes. Arrive at 11:20 AM. But Matthew is available until 1:15 PM. So meet from 11:20 AM to 11:50 AM (30 min). Then go to Robert in Alamo Square. Bayview to Alamo Square is 16 minutes. Arrive at 12:06 PM. Robert is available until 5:30 PM. Meet from 12:06 PM to 2:06 PM (120 minutes). Then go to Jeffrey. Alamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf is 21 minutes. Arrive at 2:27 PM. Jeffrey's available until 6:45 PM. Meet until 4:27 PM (120 minutes). Then go to Amanda. Fisherman's Wharf to Marina District (10 min), arrive 4:37 PM. Amanda's available from 2:45 PM. Meet from 4:37 PM to 6:22 PM (105 minutes). Then go to Karen. Marina District to Mission District is 20 min. Arrive 6:42 PM. Karen's available until 8:30 PM. Meet until 8:27 PM (105 minutes). Then go to Nancy. Mission District to Pacific Heights is 16 min. Arrive 8:43 PM. Nancy's available until 9:30 PM. Meet from 8:43 PM to 9:30 PM (47 minutes). Not enough for 105. So Nancy can't be met here. Alternatively, after Amanda, go to Nancy. Marina District to Pacific Heights is 7 minutes. Arrive 6:29 PM. Meet from 6:29 PM to 8:14 PM (105 min). Then go to Karen. Pacific Heights to Mission District is 15 min. Arrive 8:29 PM. Karen is available until 8:30 PM. Only 1 minute. Not enough. So Karen can't be met here. So in this scenario, we miss Karen and Nancy. But in the previous scenario, we were meeting Amanda, Karen, and Nancy partially. So which is better?\n\nAlternatively, let's see which people can be included. The original plan had Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, and Joseph. If we can include more, but the constraints may require trade-offs.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, the initial plan after meeting Robert and Jeffrey, we have Amanda and then Nancy and Karen. But Karen can't be met. So perhaps the optimal schedule includes Joseph in the morning, then Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Karen, and Nancy. But time constraints make some impossible.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nJoseph: Needs 105 minutes, available all day. So maybe slot him in the evening.\n\nLet's try:\n\nStart at Presidio at 9 AM. Go to Matthew in Bayview first. Presidio to Bayview is 31 minutes. Arrive 9:31 AM. But Matthew's available from 10:15 AM. So wait until 10:15 AM. Meet until 10:45 AM. Then go to Alamo Square (Robert). Bayview to Alamo Square: 16 minutes. Arrive 11:01 AM. Robert's available from 11:15 AM. Wait until 11:15 AM. Meet until 1:15 PM. Then go to Fisherman's Wharf (Jeffrey). Alamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf: 21 minutes. Arrive 1:36 PM. Meet until 3:36 PM. Then to Marina District (Amanda). 10 minutes, arrive 3:46 PM. Meet until 5:31 PM. Then to Pacific Heights (Nancy). 7 minutes, arrive 5:38 PM. Meet until 7:23 PM. Then to Mission District (Karen). 15 minutes, arrive 7:38 PM. Meet until 9:23 PM (but Karen is available until 8:30 PM). So only until 8:30 PM. That's 52 minutes. Not enough. Alternatively, after Amanda, go to Karen. Marina District to Mission District: 20 minutes. Arrive 5:51 PM. Meet until 7:36 PM. Then to Nancy: Mission District to Pacific Heights: 16 minutes. Arrive 7:52 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM. 98 minutes. Still not enough. So Nancy can't be met.\n\nAlternatively, after Nancy, if we can meet Joseph. Let's say after Nancy ends at 7:23 PM, go to Golden Gate Park. Pacific Heights to Golden Gate Park is 16 minutes. Arrive 7:39 PM. Meet Joseph until 9:24 PM (105 minutes). He's available until 9:15 PM, so end at 9:15 PM. That's 96 minutes. Not enough. So that's not sufficient.\n\nHmm. So in this scenario, we meet Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, and Nancy (but Nancy's time isn't enough), and Joseph. But this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Joseph in the evening. Let's try:\n\nStart at Presidio 9 AM. Go to Melissa in The Castro. Presidio to The Castro is 21 minutes. Arrive 9:21 AM. Melissa is available at 9:30 AM. Meet 9:30-10:00 AM (30 min). Then go to Matthew in Bayview. The Castro to Bayview is 19 minutes. Arrive 10:19 AM. Meet 10:19-10:49 AM. Then to Alamo Square (Robert). Bayview to Alamo Square 16 minutes. Arrive 11:05 AM. Robert available at 11:15 AM. Meet 11:15-1:15 PM. Then to Jeffrey (Fisherman's Wharf). 21 minutes. Arrive 1:36 PM. Meet until 3:36 PM. Then to Amanda (Marina District). 10 minutes. Arrive 3:46 PM. Meet until 5:31 PM. Then to Karen (Mission District). 20 minutes. Arrive 5:51 PM. Meet until 7:36 PM. Then to Nancy (Pacific Heights). 16 minutes. Arrive 7:52 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM (98 minutes). Then to Joseph (Golden Gate Park). 16 minutes. Arrive 9:46 PM, but Joseph is available until 9:15 PM. So can't meet him. So Joseph is missed here.\n\nAlternatively, after Karen, go to Joseph. Mission District to Golden Gate Park is 17 minutes. Arrive 7:53 PM. Meet until 9:38 PM, but Joseph's available until 9:15 PM. So meet until 9:15 PM (82 minutes). Not enough. So Joseph can't be met here.\n\nAlternatively, meet Joseph in the morning. Let's try:\n\nPresidio to Golden Gate Park (12 min). Arrive 9:12 AM. Meet Joseph 9:12-10:57 AM. Then go to Matthew. Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 23 minutes. Arrive 11:20 AM. Matthew available until 1:15 PM. Meet 11:20-11:50 AM. Then to Alamo Square (16 min). Arrive 12:06 PM. Robert available at 11:15 AM. Meet 12:06-2:06 PM. Then to Fisherman's Wharf (Jeffrey) 21 min. Arrive 2:27 PM. Meet until 4:27 PM. Then to Amanda (Marina District) 10 min. Arrive 4:37 PM. Meet until 6:22 PM. Then to Karen (Mission District) 20 min. Arrive 6:42 PM. Meet until 8:27 PM. Then to Nancy (Pacific Heights) 16 min. Arrive 8:43 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM (47 min). Not enough. So Nancy and Joseph are met, but Karen and Nancy's time is insufficient. So how many people can be met?\n\nIn this plan: Joseph, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Karen (partial), Nancy (partial). But Karen and Nancy's meetings are below required time. So only Joseph, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, and Melissa. Wait, Melissa wasn't in this plan. Let's see: in the first scenario, we met Joseph, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Karen (partial), and Nancy (partial). But Melissa wasn't included. Wait, in the first plan where we met Melissa first, then Matthew, then Robert, etc., that included Melissa. So maybe that's better.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nOption 1:\n\nStart at Presidio 9 AM.\n\n- 9:00 AM Presidio.\n- 9:00 AM leave Presidio to The Castro (21 min): arrive 9:21 AM. Wait until 9:30 AM. Meet Melissa 9:30-10:00 AM.\n- Then to Bayview (19 min): arrive 10:19 AM. Meet Matthew 10:19-10:49 AM.\n- Then to Alamo Square (16 min): arrive 11:05 AM. Wait until 11:15 AM. Meet Robert 11:15 AM -1:15 PM.\n- Then to Fisherman's Wharf (21 min): arrive 1:36 PM. Meet Jeffrey 1:36 PM -3:36 PM.\n- Then to Marina District (10 min): arrive 3:46 PM. Meet Amanda 3:46 PM -5:31 PM.\n- Then to Mission District (20 min): arrive 5:51 PM. Meet Karen 5:51 PM -7:36 PM.\n- Then to Pacific Heights (16 min): arrive 7:52 PM. Meet Nancy until 9:30 PM (98 minutes, but she needs 105).\n\nIn this case, Karen is met for the full duration (105), but Nancy is 98 minutes. But since Nancy's window ends at 9:30 PM, maybe we can start earlier. Wait, after Karen, if we go to Nancy directly:\n\nKaren ends at 7:36 PM. Travel to Pacific Heights takes 16 minutes. Arrive 7:52 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM. That's 1h38m = 98 minutes. Close but not enough. So Nancy's meeting is 98 minutes instead of 105. Maybe the schedule can't fit all, so we have to drop one. Alternatively, adjust the order.\n\nWait, if after Amanda, we go to Nancy instead of Karen:\n\nAmanda ends at 5:31 PM. Travel to Pacific Heights (7 minutes). Arrive 5:38 PM. Meet until 7:23 PM (105 min). Then to Karen (Mission District): 15 min. Arrive 7:38 PM. Meet until 8:30 PM. That's 52 minutes. Not enough. So Karen can't be met.\n\nAlternatively, after Amanda, go to Golden Gate Park to meet Joseph. Marina District to Golden Gate Park is 18 minutes. Arrive 5:49 PM. Meet until 7:34 PM (105 min). Then to Karen: Golden Gate Park to Mission District is 17 min. Arrive 7:51 PM. Meet until 8:30 PM (39 min). Not enough. So Karen can't be met.\n\nSo in this scenario, the people met are Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, and Joseph. That's six people. But wait, Joseph wasn't included in this plan. So where is Joseph's meeting? In this plan, Joseph wasn't scheduled. Because in the first option, after Presidio, went to Melissa, then others. To include Joseph, we need to fit him in somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Amanda at 5:31 PM, go to Joseph. Marina District to Golden Gate Park is 18 minutes. Arrive 5:49 PM. Meet until 7:34 PM (105 min). Then to Nancy: Golden Gate Park to Pacific Heights is 16 min. Arrive 7:50 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM (100 min). Close but not enough. So Nancy's meeting is 100 minutes. Still not meeting the required 105. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Joseph in the morning. Let's see:\n\nStart at Presidio 9 AM. Go to Joseph in Golden Gate Park (12 min). Arrive 9:12 AM. Meet until 10:57 AM. Then to Melissa in The Castro (13 min travel from Golden Gate Park to The Castro: 13 minutes? Wait, Golden Gate Park to The Castro is 13 minutes according to the travel times. So leave Golden Gate Park at 10:57 AM, arrive The Castro at 11:10 AM. Melissa's available until 5 PM. Meet from 11:10 AM to 11:40 AM (30 min). Then go to Matthew in Bayview. The Castro to Bayview is 19 min. Arrive 11:59 AM. Matthew's available until 1:15 PM. Meet until 12:29 PM (30 min). Then to Robert in Alamo Square. Bayview to Alamo Square is 16 min. Arrive 12:45 PM. Robert available from 11:15 AM. Meet from 12:45 PM to 2:45 PM (120 min). Then to Jeffrey in Fisherman's Wharf (Alamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf 21 min. Arrive 3:06 PM. Meet until 5:06 PM. Then to Amanda in Marina District (10 min. Arrive 5:16 PM. Amanda available until 7:30 PM. Meet until 7:01 PM (105 min). Then to Karen in Mission District (20 min. Arrive 7:21 PM. Meet until 9:06 PM, but Karen's available until 8:30 PM. So meet until 8:30 PM (69 min). Not enough. Then to Nancy: Mission District to Pacific Heights (16 min. Arrive 8:46 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM (44 min). Not enough. So this way, Joseph, Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda are met. Karen and Nancy can't be met.\n\nSo this includes six people. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, what if we skip Robert? Let's see.\n\nStart at Presidio 9 AM. Go to Matthew in Bayview (31 min, arrive 9:31 AM. Wait until 10:15 AM. Meet until 10:45 AM. Then to Melissa in The Castro. Bayview to The Castro is 19 min. Arrive 11:04 AM. Meet until 11:34 AM. Then to Fisherman's Wharf (The Castro to Fisherman's Wharf is 24 min. Arrive 11:58 AM. Jeffrey available from 12:45 PM. Wait until 12:45 PM. Meet until 2:45 PM. Then to Amanda in Marina District (10 min. Arrive 2:55 PM. Amanda available from 2:45 PM. Meet until 4:30 PM (105 min). Then to Golden Gate Park (18 min. Arrive 4:48 PM. Meet Joseph until 6:33 PM. Then to Karen in Mission District (17 min. Arrive 6:50 PM. Meet until 8:35 PM, but Karen's available until 8:30 PM. So meet until 8:30 PM (100 min). Then to Nancy in Pacific Heights (16 min. Arrive 8:46 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM (44 min). Not enough. So in this scenario, we meet Matthew, Melissa, Jeffrey, Amanda, Joseph, Karen (partial), and Nancy (partial). So six people. But Robert is skipped.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps include Robert instead of someone else. For example, if Robert is met, then maybe skip Melissa or someone else.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to list all the required durations and see which can be scheduled:\n\nAmanda: 105 min in Marina 2:45-7:30 PM\n\nMelissa: 30 min in Castro 9:30 AM-5 PM\n\nJeffrey: 120 min in Fisherman's 12:45-6:45 PM\n\nMatthew: 30 min in Bayview 10:15 AM-1:15 PM\n\nNancy: 105 min in Pacific Heights 5 PM-9:30 PM\n\nKaren: 105 min in Mission District 5:30-8:30 PM\n\nRobert: 120 min in Alamo Square 11:15 AM-5:30 PM\n\nJoseph: 105 min in Golden Gate Park 8:30 AM-9:15 PM\n\nThe earliest available after 9 AM is Matthew in Bayview, but travel time is 31 min from Presidio. So earliest arrival 9:31 AM, but Matthew is available at 10:15 AM. Alternatively, go to Melissa first. Presidio to The Castro is 21 min. Arrive 9:21 AM. Wait until 9:30 AM. Meet Melissa 9:30-10:00 AM. Then to Matthew: Castro to Bayview 19 min. Arrive 10:19 AM. Meet until 10:49 AM. Then to Robert: Bayview to Alamo Square 16 min. Arrive 11:05 AM. Wait until 11:15 AM. Meet until 1:15 PM. Then to Jeffrey: Alamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf 21 min. Arrive 1:36 PM. Meet until 3:36 PM. Then to Amanda: Fisherman's to Marina District 10 min. Arrive 3:46 PM. Meet until 5:31 PM. Then to Golden Gate Park (Joseph): Marina to GGP 18 min. Arrive 5:49 PM. Meet until 7:34 PM. Then to Karen: GGP to Mission District 17 min. Arrive 7:51 PM. Meet until 8:30 PM (39 min). Not enough. Then to Nancy: Mission to Pacific Heights 16 min. Arrive 8:46 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM (44 min). So in this case, Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Joseph are met. Karen and Nancy aren't. Alternatively, after Amanda, go to Karen first. Amanda ends at 5:31 PM. Marina to Mission District 20 min. Arrive 5:51 PM. Meet until 7:36 PM. Then to Nancy: Mission to Pacific Heights 16 min. Arrive 7:52 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM (98 min). Then to Joseph: Pacific Heights to GGP 16 min. Arrive 9:46 PM, but Joseph's window ends at 9:15 PM. So can't meet.\n\nAlternatively, after Amanda, go to Nancy first. Marina to Pacific Heights 7 min. Arrive 5:38 PM. Meet until 7:23 PM (105 min). Then to Karen: Pacific Heights to Mission District 15 min. Arrive 7:38 PM. Meet until 8:30 PM (52 min). Not enough. Then to Joseph: Mission to GGP 17 min. Arrive 8:47 PM. Meet until 9:15 PM (28 min). Not enough.\n\nSo in all scenarios, it's challenging to meet all eight people. Let's count how many can be met:\n\nOption 1: Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Karen (partial), Nancy (partial) \u2192 6 people (assuming partial doesn't count).\n\nOption 2: Joseph, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Karen (partial), Nancy (partial) \u2192 6.\n\nOption 3: Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Joseph \u2192 6.\n\nOption 4: Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Karen (partial) \u2192 5 (Karen partial doesn't count).\n\nSo the maximum is six people. The problem states to meet as many as possible. So which six?\n\nThe best option is to meet Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, and Joseph, as they can all meet their minimums. Let's see:\n\nPresidio \u2192 Melissa (The Castro) 9:30-10:00.\n\nThen to Matthew (Bayview) 10:19-10:49.\n\nThen to Robert (Alamo Square) 11:15-1:15.\n\nThen to Jeffrey (Fisherman's Wharf) 1:36-3:36.\n\nThen to Amanda (Marina) 3:46-5:31.\n\nThen to Joseph (Golden Gate Park) 5:49-7:34.\n\nThen perhaps Nancy, but not possible. So Joseph's meeting is possible here. Let's check the travel times:\n\nAfter Amanda ends at 5:31 PM, go to Golden Gate Park. Marina District to Golden Gate Park is 18 minutes. Arrive 5:49 PM. Meet Joseph from 5:49 PM to 7:34 PM (105 minutes). He's available until 9:15 PM, so that's fine.\n\nThen, after Joseph, can we meet anyone else? Golden Gate Park to Pacific Heights is 16 minutes. Arrive 7:50 PM. Meet Nancy until 9:30 PM. 100 minutes, which is 1h40m. But she needs 105. So not enough. So can't meet her.\n\nAlternatively, after Joseph, go to Karen. Golden Gate Park to Mission District is 17 minutes. Arrive 7:51 PM. Meet until 8:30 PM. 39 minutes. Not enough. So Karen can't be met.\n\nSo this plan includes Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Joseph. Six people.\n\nAlternatively, another arrangement that includes Karen instead of Joseph? Let's see:\n\nPresidio \u2192 Melissa (9:30-10:00).\n\nMatthew (10:19-10:49).\n\nRobert (11:15-1:15).\n\nJeffrey (1:36-3:36).\n\nAmanda (3:46-5:31).\n\nKaren (5:51-7:36).\n\nNancy (7:52-9:30, 98 min).\n\nSo Karen is fully met, but Nancy is not. Joseph is not met. So this gives six people: Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Karen. Nancy and Joseph are partial.\n\nSo which is better: including Joseph or Karen? Both require 105 minutes. The problem says to meet as many friends as possible. So six in either case.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal schedule includes both Joseph and Karen, but with some adjustments. Alternatively, perhaps Joseph can be met after Amanda but before Karen.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAfter Amanda ends at 5:31 PM, go to Joseph in Golden Gate Park (18 min. Arrive 5:49 PM. Meet until 7:34 PM. Then go to Karen (Mission District) 17 min. Arrive 7:51 PM. Meet until 8:30 PM. 39 minutes. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, meet Joseph in the morning. Presidio \u2192 Golden Gate Park: 9:12 AM. Meet until 10:57 AM. Then to Melissa: 13 min. Arrive 11:10 AM. Meet until 11:40 AM. Then to Matthew: Bayview 19 min. Arrive 12:00 noon. But Matthew is available until 1:15 PM. Meet until 12:30 PM. Then to Robert: Alamo Square 16 min. Arrive 12:46 PM. Robert available from 11:15 AM. Meet until 2:46 PM (but Robert's window ends at 5:30 PM). Wait, Robert's available until 5:30 PM. But if we meet him from 12:46 PM to 2:46 PM (120 min), then to Jeffrey: Alamo Square to Fisherman's 21 min. Arrive 3:07 PM. Meet until 5:07 PM. Then to Amanda: Fisherman's to Marina 10 min. Arrive 5:17 PM. Meet until 7:02 PM. Then to Karen: Marina to Mission 20 min. Arrive 7:22 PM. Meet until 9:07 PM, but Karen's available until 8:30 PM. So until 8:30 PM (68 min). Not enough. Then to Nancy: Mission to Pacific Heights 16 min. Arrive 8:46 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM (44 min). So in this case, Joseph, Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda are met. Karen and Nancy partial. So six again.\n\nComparing the two options:\n\nOption A: Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Joseph.\n\nOption B: Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, Karen.\n\nWhich is better? The problem states to meet as many friends as possible. Both are six. But maybe Joseph's window is longer, allowing for more flexibility. However, Joseph is available all day, so perhaps easier to fit in.\n\nBut according to the constraints, the user wants to meet as many as possible. So the optimal schedule is the one that includes six friends with all minimum durations met.\n\nIn the first scenario:\n\nItinerary:\n\n1. Meet Melissa at The Castro 9:30-10:00.\n\n2. Meet Matthew at Bayview 10:19-10:49.\n\n3. Meet Robert at Alamo Square 11:15-1:15.\n\n4. Meet Jeffrey at Fisherman's Wharf 1:36-3:36.\n\n5. Meet Amanda at Marina District 3:46-5:31.\n\n6. Meet Joseph at Golden Gate Park 5:49-7:34.\n\nThen travel to Nancy, but not enough time. So this includes six people.\n\nAlternatively, can we meet Nancy instead of Joseph?\n\nAfter Amanda ends at 5:31 PM, go to Nancy in Pacific Heights (7 min. Arrive 5:38 PM. Meet until 7:23 PM. Then to Joseph: Pacific Heights to GGP 16 min. Arrive 7:39 PM. Meet until 9:15 PM (96 min). Not enough. So Joseph's meeting is not possible.\n\nThus, the maximum is six people. So the best schedule is the one that includes Melissa, Matthew, Robert, Jeffrey, Amanda, and Joseph.\n\nNow, let's verify the travel times and ensure there's no overlap.\n\n- Presidio to The Castro: 21 min. Start at 9:00 AM, arrive 9:21 AM. Wait until 9:30 AM.\n\n- The Castro to Bayview: 19 min. Leave 10:00 AM, arrive 10:19 AM.\n\n- Bayview to Alamo Square: 16 min. Leave 10:49 AM, arrive 11:05 AM. Wait until 11:15 AM.\n\n- Alamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf: 21 min. Leave 1:15 PM, arrive 1:36 PM.\n\n- Fisherman's Wharf to Marina District: 10 min. Leave 3:36 PM, arrive 3:46 PM.\n\n- Marina District to Golden Gate Park: 18 min. Leave 5:31 PM, arrive 5:49 PM.\n\nEach travel time is accounted for. The meetings fit within the time windows.\n\nMelissa: 9:30-10:00 (30 min).\n\nMatthew: 10:19-10:49 (30 min).\n\nRobert: 11:15-1:15 (120 min).\n\nJeffrey: 1:36-3:36 (120 min).\n\nAmanda: 3:46-5:31 (105 min).\n\nJoseph: 5:49-7:34 (105 min).\n\nAll times are within their availability windows and meet the minimum durations.\n\nThis schedule includes six friends. Are there any other possible combinations with six?\n\nAnother possibility: Could we meet Karen instead of Amanda?\n\nAmanda's window is 2:45-7:30 PM. If we skip Amanda, perhaps meet Karen and Nancy. But would that allow more friends? Let's see.\n\nFor example:\n\nAfter Jeffrey ends at 3:36 PM, go to Golden Gate Park (25 min). Arrive 4:01 PM. Meet Joseph until 5:46 PM. Then to Karen (17 min). Arrive 6:03 PM. Meet until 7:48 PM. But Karen's window ends at 8:30 PM. So 7:48 PM is over. So meet until 8:30 PM. That's 1h27m, which is 87 minutes. Not enough. Then to Nancy: 16 min. Arrive 8:46 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM. 44 min. Not enough. So this way, Joseph and Karen are not fully met. So this is worse.\n\nThus, the best option is the six friends mentioned earlier.\n\nFinally, confirm the JSON format with these meetings.",
