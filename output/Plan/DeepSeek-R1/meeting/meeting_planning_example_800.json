            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to schedule all these meetings. So, the user starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and the constraints each person has. Let me go through each person's availability and required meeting time.\n\nFirst, looking at the constraints:\n\n- Kimberly is at North Beach from 7:00 AM to 10:30 AM, needs 15 minutes. Since the user arrives at 9:00 AM, maybe they can meet Kimberly first. The travel time from Union Square to North Beach is 10 minutes. So leaving at 9:00, arriving at 9:10. If they meet from 9:10 to 9:25, that's 15 minutes. Then they have to go to the next meeting.\n\nNext, Brian is at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM, needs 45 minutes. After Kimberly, maybe go to Fisherman's Wharf. Travel time from North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf is 5 minutes (since North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf is 5). So leaving at 9:25, arrive at 9:30. Then meet Brian from 9:30 to 10:15 (45 minutes). That works.\n\nThen, Kenneth is at Nob Hill from 12:15 PM to 5:15 PM, needs 105 minutes (1h45m). Let's see. After Brian, maybe go to Nob Hill. Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. So leaving at 10:15, arrive at 10:26. But Kenneth isn't available until 12:15 PM. So there's a gap here. Maybe fill that with another meeting or wait. Alternatively, maybe meet someone else in between. Let's check other options.\n\nWait, after Brian ends at 10:15 AM, the next possible meeting could be Joseph at Embarcadero from 3:30 PM to 7:30 PM (needs 75 minutes). But that's later. Or maybe meet Kenneth first. Wait, Kenneth is available from 12:15 PM. So the time between 10:15 AM to 12:15 PM is 2 hours. Maybe there's another person to meet here? Let's check others.\n\nWait, the other people have later availabilities. Let's see. After Brian, maybe go to Nob Hill to meet Kenneth, but he's not available until 12:15 PM. So perhaps schedule Kenneth starting at 12:15 PM. Let's see. From Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. If we leave at 10:15, arrive at 10:26, but Kenneth isn't there yet. So that's not possible. Hmm, maybe after Brian, go somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe check if there's a way to fit another meeting between 10:15 AM and 12:15 PM.\n\nWait, perhaps after meeting Brian at Fisherman's Wharf until 10:15, then go to Embarcadero? But Joseph is available from 3:30 PM. Not helpful. Or maybe check other friends. Let's see. The other friends are Melissa (The Castro 8:15-9:15 PM), Barbara (Alamo Square 8:45-9:45 PM), Joshua (Presidio 4:30-6:15 PM), Steven (Mission District 7:30-9 PM), Betty (Haight-Ashbury 7-8:30 PM). These are all later. So between 10:15 AM and 12:15 PM, maybe travel to Kenneth's location (Nob Hill) and wait until he's available. But that's a long wait. Alternatively, is there another person available during that window? Let me check again. The only other person in the morning is Kimberly and Brian. So perhaps after Brian, go to Nob Hill and wait until 12:15 PM. But that's 2 hours of waiting. Not efficient. Maybe there's a way to optimize.\n\nWait, maybe the initial schedule is Kimberly, then Brian, then Kenneth. Let's see:\n\nKimberly: 9:10-9:25 AM (15 min). Then to Fisherman's Wharf at 9:30-10:15 AM. Then from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill: 11 minutes. Arrive at 10:26. But Kenneth is available at 12:15. So there's a 1 hour and 49 minutes gap. Maybe use that time to meet someone else. But looking at the others:\n\nJoseph is at Embarcadero from 3:30 PM. Betty is at Haight-Ashbury from 7 PM. Steven is at Mission District from 7:30 PM. Barbara at Alamo Square from 8:45 PM. Melissa at The Castro from 8:15 PM. Joshua at Presidio from 4:30 PM. So during the gap between 10:15 AM and 12:15 PM, no other friends are available. So maybe that's unavoidable. Let's proceed.\n\nKenneth needs 105 minutes. So from 12:15 PM to 2:00 PM (12:15 + 1h45m = 14:00). But wait, 12:15 PM to 2:00 PM is 1h45m, which is 105 minutes. So meeting Kenneth from 12:15 PM to 2:00 PM. Then, after that, next possible meetings.\n\nAfter Kenneth, the next is Joshua at Presidio from 4:30 PM to 6:15 PM, needing 105 minutes. Let's see. From Nob Hill to Presidio is 17 minutes. If we leave at 2:00 PM, arrive at 2:17 PM. But Joshua is available from 4:30 PM. So again, a gap here. Maybe meet Joseph at Embarcadero during this time. Joseph is available from 3:30 PM to 7:30 PM, needs 75 minutes. Let's see. After Kenneth ends at 2:00 PM, maybe go to Embarcadero. Travel time from Nob Hill to Embarcadero is 9 minutes. Arrive at 2:09 PM. But Joseph isn't available until 3:30 PM. So another gap. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps schedule Joshua first after Kenneth, but Joshua is available only from 4:30 PM. So if we leave Nob Hill at 2:00 PM, go to Presidio (17 min), arrive at 2:17 PM. But Joshua isn't available until 4:30 PM. So maybe wait there, but that's over 2 hours. Not efficient. Alternatively, maybe find a way to meet Joseph and Joshua in sequence.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can rearrange. Maybe meet Kenneth earlier? Wait, Kenneth is available from 12:15 PM. So the initial schedule for Kimberly and Brian is okay. Then, after Brian, perhaps fill the time between 10:15 AM and 12:15 PM with another activity, but there's no one else available. So perhaps just wait until 12:15 PM to meet Kenneth.\n\nSo schedule:\n\n9:00 AM arrive at Union Square.\n\n9:10-9:25 AM meet Kimberly at North Beach (15 min).\n\n9:25-9:30 AM travel to Fisherman's Wharf (5 min).\n\n9:30-10:15 AM meet Brian (45 min).\n\n10:15-10:26 AM travel to Nob Hill (11 min).\n\nWait until 12:15 PM.\n\n12:15 PM - 2:00 PM meet Kenneth (105 min).\n\nThen, after that, travel to Presidio (17 min) arrives at 2:17 PM, but Joshua is available from 4:30 PM. So that's a 2h13m gap. Not good. Alternatively, after Kenneth, go to Embarcadero to meet Joseph. But Joseph is available from 3:30 PM. So from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM is 1h30m. Travel time from Nob Hill to Embarcadero is 9 minutes. Arrive at 2:09 PM. Wait until 3:30 PM (1h21m). Then meet Joseph from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM (75 min). Then from Embarcadero to Presidio (20 min). Arrive at 5:05 PM. Joshua is available until 6:15 PM. Need 105 minutes, but only have 70 minutes (from 5:05 to 6:15). Not enough. So Joshua's meeting can't fit if we meet Joseph.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps skip Joseph and meet Joshua. Let's see. After Kenneth ends at 2:00 PM, go to Presidio. Arrive at 2:17 PM. Wait until 4:30 PM (2h13m). Then meet Joshua from 4:30 PM to 6:15 PM (105 minutes). That works. Then after that, go to meet Joseph? But Joseph is available until 7:30 PM. If we leave Presidio at 6:15 PM, travel to Embarcadero (20 min). Arrive at 6:35 PM. Meet Joseph from 6:35 PM to 7:50 PM (75 minutes). But Joseph is available until 7:30 PM. So that's only 55 minutes (from 6:35 to 7:30). Not enough. So Joseph's meeting can't fit here.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua ends at 6:15 PM, go to meet Betty at Haight-Ashbury. Betty is available from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM. Needs 90 minutes. Travel time from Presidio to Haight-Ashbury is 15 minutes. Arrive at 6:30 PM. Wait until 7:00 PM. Meet from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM (90 minutes). Then, after that, go to Steven at Mission District (available 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM, needs 90 minutes). But Betty's meeting ends at 8:30 PM. Travel from Haight-Ashbury to Mission District is 11 minutes. Arrive at 8:41 PM. Steven's available until 9:00 PM. So meet from 8:41 PM to 9:00 PM, which is 19 minutes. Not enough. Alternatively, maybe start Betty's meeting earlier. But Betty is available from 7:00 PM. So if we meet Betty from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM, then travel to Mission District (11 min) arrive at 8:41 PM, meet Steven from 8:41 PM to 9:00 PM (19 minutes). Not enough. Steven needs 90 minutes. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after Joshua, go to meet Steven first. From Presidio to Mission District is 26 minutes. Arrive at 6:41 PM (if leave at 6:15 PM). Steven is available from 7:30 PM. Wait until 7:30 PM. Meet from 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM (90 minutes). Then, after that, go to Betty. Betty's available until 8:30 PM. But Steven's meeting ends at 9:00 PM, which is after Betty's availability. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Betty first after Joshua. From Presidio to Haight-Ashbury is 15 minutes. Arrive at 6:30 PM. Wait until 7:00 PM. Meet Betty until 8:30 PM. Then go to Mission District (11 min) arrive at 8:41 PM. Steven is there until 9:00 PM. But Steven needs 90 minutes. Only 19 minutes available. Not enough. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Joshua, go to meet Joseph. Let's see. Presidio to Embarcadero is 20 minutes. Arrive at 6:35 PM. Joseph is available until 7:30 PM. So meet from 6:35 PM to 7:30 PM (55 minutes). But Joseph needs 75 minutes. Not enough. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm. So perhaps Joshua can't be met if we also want to meet Joseph. Alternatively, maybe prioritize Joseph over Joshua. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Kenneth from 12:15 PM to 2:00 PM, then go to Embarcadero to meet Joseph. Travel time from Nob Hill to Embarcadero is 9 minutes. Arrive at 2:09 PM. Joseph is available from 3:30 PM. Wait until 3:30 PM. Meet from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM (75 minutes). Then, after that, go to Presidio (20 minutes). Arrive at 5:05 PM. Joshua is available until 6:15 PM. So meet from 5:05 PM to 6:15 PM (70 minutes). Needs 105, so insufficient. So Joshua can't be met. But maybe that's better than not meeting Joseph. Alternatively, maybe Joshua is more important? Or perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the order. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Kenneth, go to Joseph first. Let's see:\n\nKenneth ends at 2:00 PM. Travel to Embarcadero (9 minutes), arrive at 2:09 PM. Joseph is available from 3:30 PM. Wait until 3:30 PM. Meet until 4:45 PM (75 min). Then go to Presidio (20 min), arrive at 5:05 PM. Joshua is available until 6:15 PM. So meet from 5:05 PM to 6:15 PM (70 minutes). Still not enough. Alternatively, leave Joseph earlier. If Joseph is available until 7:30 PM, maybe start the meeting later. For example, leave after Kenneth, do something else, then meet Joseph when he's available. But what else can be done between 2:00 PM and 3:30 PM? Maybe meet someone else. Let's check:\n\nLooking at other friends:\n\nBetty at Haight-Ashbury 7-8:30 PM.\n\nSteven at Mission District 7:30-9 PM.\n\nBarbara at Alamo Square 8:45-9:45 PM.\n\nMelissa at The Castro 8:15-9:15 PM.\n\nSo between 2:00 PM and 3:30 PM, no one is available. So that's dead time. Maybe meet Joshua after Joseph, but as before, it's not enough time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps skip Kenneth's meeting. But Kenneth is available for a long time (12:15-5:15 PM) and needs 105 minutes, which is a big chunk. Skipping him would allow for more meetings elsewhere. Let's see:\n\nIf we skip Kenneth, perhaps schedule more meetings. For example:\n\nAfter Brian (10:15 AM), maybe go to meet Joseph later. Let's see:\n\nBut Joseph is available from 3:30 PM. So after Brian at 10:15 AM, maybe meet others in between.\n\nWait, but all other friends are in the evening. So maybe after Brian, there's a long gap until Joseph. Alternatively, go to Presidio to meet Joshua. But Joshua is available from 4:30 PM. Let's see:\n\nBrian ends at 10:15 AM. Travel to Presidio (from Fisherman's Wharf to Presidio is 17 minutes). Arrive at 10:32 AM. But Joshua isn't there until 4:30 PM. So that's a long wait. Not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go to other locations. But no one is available during the day. So perhaps the initial plan of meeting Kimberly, Brian, Kenneth, then Joseph, then Joshua is the way to go, but with some conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can fit in more people by adjusting the order.\n\nWait, let's check the required times again:\n\nMelissa: The Castro 8:15-9:15 PM, needs 30 min.\n\nBarbara: Alamo Square 8:45-9:45 PM, needs 15 min.\n\nSteven: Mission District 7:30-9 PM, needs 90 min.\n\nBetty: Haight-Ashbury 7-8:30 PM, needs 90 min.\n\nJoshua: Presidio 4:30-6:15 PM, needs 105 min.\n\nJoseph: Embarcadero 3:30-7:30 PM, needs 75 min.\n\nKenneth: Nob Hill 12:15-5:15 PM, needs 105 min.\n\nBrian: Fisherman's Wharf 9:30 AM-3:30 PM, needs 45 min.\n\nKimberly: North Beach 7-10:30 AM, needs 15 min.\n\nSo after Kimberly and Brian, Kenneth is the next feasible. But perhaps after Kenneth, can we meet Joseph and then Joshua?\n\nLet me try another approach:\n\nStart at 9:00 AM Union Square.\n\nMeet Kimberly 9:10-9:25 AM.\n\nTravel to Fisherman's Wharf (5 min), meet Brian 9:30-10:15 AM.\n\nThen, go to Nob Hill (11 min), arrive 10:26 AM. Wait until 12:15 PM.\n\nMeet Kenneth 12:15 PM-2:00 PM.\n\nThen, travel to Embarcadero (9 min), arrive 2:09 PM. Wait until 3:30 PM.\n\nMeet Joseph 3:30-4:45 PM (75 min).\n\nThen, travel to Presidio (20 min), arrive 5:05 PM.\n\nMeet Joshua from 5:05 PM to 6:15 PM (70 min). Not enough, need 105. So can't meet Joshua.\n\nBut Joshua needs 105 minutes, which is not possible here. So maybe Joshua can't be met. Alternatively, skip Joseph to meet Joshua.\n\nIf after Kenneth (ends 2:00 PM), go to Presidio (17 min), arrive 2:17 PM. Wait until 4:30 PM. Meet Joshua from 4:30 PM to 6:15 PM (105 min). Then after that, go to Joseph. Travel from Presidio to Embarcadero (20 min), arrive 6:35 PM. Meet Joseph from 6:35 PM to 7:30 PM (55 min). Not enough. So Joseph can't be met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Joshua, go to Betty. From Presidio to Haight-Ashbury is 15 min. Arrive 6:30 PM. Betty is available until 8:30 PM. Meet from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM (90 min). Then go to Steven. Haight-Ashbury to Mission District is 11 min. Arrive 8:11 PM. Steven is available until 9:00 PM. Meet from 8:11 PM to 9:00 PM (49 min). Not enough for 90. So Steven can't be met.\n\nAlternatively, after Joshua ends at 6:15 PM, go to Betty. Presidio to Haight-Ashbury 15 min. Arrive 6:30 PM. Meet until 8:00 PM (90 min). Then to Steven: 8:00 PM + 11 min travel. Arrive 8:11 PM. Meet until 9:00 PM (49 min). Still not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after Betty, meet Melissa. Haight-Ashbury to The Castro is 6 min. Arrive 8:06 PM. Melissa is available from 8:15 PM. Wait until 8:15 PM. Meet until 8:45 PM (30 min). Then go to Barbara at Alamo Square. The Castro to Alamo Square is 8 min. Arrive 8:53 PM. Barbara is available until 9:45 PM. Meet from 8:53 PM to 9:08 PM (15 min). Then go to Steven. Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 min. Arrive 9:18 PM. Steven is available until 9:00 PM. So that's too late.\n\nWait, Steven is available until 9:00 PM. So after Barbara's meeting, arriving at 9:18 PM is after Steven's time. So Steven can't be met.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's see how many people we can fit.\n\nIf we prioritize Joshua and Joseph:\n\nKimberly (15), Brian (45), Kenneth (105), Joseph (75), Joshua (105). But Joshua can't fit after Joseph. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nKenneth ends at 2:00 PM. Go to Embarcadero (arrive 2:09 PM), wait until 3:30 PM. Meet Joseph until 4:45 PM. Then go to Presidio (20 min, arrive 5:05 PM). Meet Joshua from 5:05 PM to 6:15 PM (70 min). Not enough. So Joshua can't be met. So maybe we have to drop Joshua.\n\nAlternatively, meet Joshua first after Kenneth. Then Joseph.\n\nKenneth ends at 2:00 PM. Go to Presidio (17 min), arrive 2:17 PM. Wait until 4:30 PM. Meet Joshua until 6:15 PM. Then go to Joseph. Arrive at 6:35 PM. Meet until 7:30 PM (55 min). Not enough. So Joseph can't be met.\n\nSo either Joseph or Joshua can be met, not both.\n\nSimilarly, in the evening, there's Betty, Steven, Melissa, Barbara.\n\nIf after Joshua ends at 6:15 PM, go to Betty. Presidio to Haight-Ashbury 15 min. Arrive 6:30 PM. Meet from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM (waiting from 6:30 to 7:00). Then go to Steven. Arrive 8:41 PM. Meet until 9:00 PM. Not enough. Or after Betty, meet Melissa and Barbara.\n\nHaight-Ashbury to The Castro: 6 min. Arrive 8:36 PM (if leave at 8:30 PM). Melissa is available until 9:15 PM. Meet from 8:36 PM to 9:06 PM (30 min). Then to Alamo Square (8 min). Arrive 9:14 PM. Barbara is available until 9:45 PM. Meet from 9:14 PM to 9:29 PM (15 min). But the user's schedule ends at 9:45 PM.\n\nBut Steven would be missed.\n\nAlternatively, after Betty, go to Mission District to meet Steven. Arrive at 8:41 PM. Meet from 8:41 PM to 9:00 PM (19 min). Not enough. So Steven can't be met.\n\nSo the possible people to meet are Kimberly, Brian, Kenneth, Joshua, Joseph, Betty, Melissa, Barbara. But depending on choices, some will be missed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps prioritize evening meetings.\n\nAfter Kenneth (ends 2:00 PM), go to meet Joseph from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM. Then go to Presidio (arrive 5:05 PM) and meet Joshua until 6:15 PM (70 min). Not enough. So drop Joshua. Then proceed to meet Betty, Steven, Melissa, Barbara.\n\nBut after Joseph ends at 4:45 PM, go to Betty's location (Haight-Ashbury). Embarcadero to Haight-Ashbury is 21 min. Arrive at 5:06 PM. Betty is available from 7:00 PM. So wait until 7:00 PM. Meet until 8:30 PM. Then go to Steven: 8:41 PM to 9:00 PM (19 min). Not enough. Alternatively, from Betty to Mission District: 11 min. Arrive 8:41 PM. Steven ends at 9:00 PM. Still not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after Joseph, go to meet Steven first. Embarcadero to Mission District is 20 min. Arrive 5:05 PM. Steven is available from 7:30 PM. Wait until 7:30 PM. Meet until 9:00 PM (90 min). Then go to Betty? But Betty ends at 8:30 PM. So no. Alternatively, after Steven, meet Melissa and Barbara. Mission District to The Castro is 7 min. Arrive 9:07 PM. Melissa is available until 9:15 PM. Meet 9:07-9:15 PM (8 min). Not enough. Then to Alamo Square (10 min). Arrive 9:25 PM. Barbara available until 9:45 PM. Meet 9:25-9:40 (15 min). But Melissa's meeting is only 8 minutes. So Melissa can't be met.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Let's try to maximize the number of meetings.\n\nPossible itinerary:\n\n1. Kimberly (9:10-9:25)\n2. Brian (9:30-10:15)\n3. Kenneth (12:15-14:00)\n4. Joseph (15:30-16:45)\n5. Betty (19:00-20:30)\n6. Steven (20:41-21:00) \u2192 Not enough time\n7. Melissa (20:30-21:00) \u2192 Not enough\n8. Barbara (20:45-21:00) \u2192 Possible 15 min.\n\nAlternatively, after Betty, go to Melissa.\n\nBetty ends at 20:30. Travel to The Castro (6 min). Arrive 20:36. Melissa available until 21:15. Meet 20:36-21:06 (30 min). Then go to Barbara at Alamo Square (8 min). Arrive 21:14. Meet until 21:29 (15 min). Barbara available until 21:45. So this works. Then Steven can't be met.\n\nSo possible meetings: Kimberly, Brian, Kenneth, Joseph, Betty, Melissa, Barbara. That's 7 people. Joshua and Steven can't be met.\n\nAlternatively, if we drop Joseph to meet Joshua:\n\nKimberly, Brian, Kenneth, Joshua, Betty, Melissa, Barbara. Also 7. But Steven can't be met.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: after Kenneth, go to Joshua, then Betty, Melissa, Barbara. But let's see:\n\nKenneth ends at 14:00. Travel to Presidio (17 min). Arrive 14:17. Wait until 16:30 (Joshua available at 4:30 PM). Wait 2h13m. Then meet Joshua from 16:30 to 18:15 (105 min). Then travel to Haight-Ashbury (15 min). Arrive 18:30. Meet Betty from 19:00-20:30 (waiting 30 min). Then to Melissa (6 min). Meet 20:36-21:06. Then to Barbara (8 min). Meet until 21:21. Then Barbara's meeting is 15 min. So that works. So this allows meeting Kimberly, Brian, Kenneth, Joshua, Betty, Melissa, Barbara. Also 7.\n\nBut in this case, Joseph and Steven are missed.\n\nSo which schedule allows more meetings? Let's compare:\n\nOption 1: Kimberly, Brian, Kenneth, Joseph, Betty, Melissa, Barbara (7).\n\nOption 2: Kimberly, Brian, Kenneth, Joshua, Betty, Melissa, Barbara (7).\n\nBut what about Steven? His time is 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM. Needs 90 minutes. If we can fit him in.\n\nIn option 1, after Joseph ends at 16:45, travel to Haight-Ashbury (21 min from Embarcadero). Arrive 17:06. Betty is available from 19:00. Wait 1h54m. Then meet Betty until 20:30. Then Melissa until 21:00. Barbara until 21:15. But Steven's time is 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM. If after Betty's meeting, go to Steven. From Haight-Ashbury to Mission District is 11 min. Arrive 20:41. Meet from 20:41 to 21:00 (19 min). Not enough. So Steven can't be met.\n\nIn option 2, after Joshua ends at 18:15, go to Betty (arrive 18:30). Wait until 19:00. Meet until 20:30. Then Melissa (until 21:06). Barbara until 21:21. Steven can't be met.\n\nSo either way, Steven can't be met.\n\nSo which option includes more people? Both include 7. But Joseph vs Joshua.\n\nJoseph requires 75 min, Joshua 105. Joseph is available from 3:30 PM to 7:30 PM, longer window. Joshua is only available from 4:30 PM to 6:15 PM. So Joseph's meeting is easier to fit in after Kenneth, but then Joshua can't be met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another schedule.\n\nLet's try to fit in Steven. For that, after meeting Betty, we need at least 90 minutes. For example:\n\nBetty from 19:00-20:30. Then travel to Mission District (11 min). Arrive 20:41. Steven available until 21:00. Only 19 minutes. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, meet Steven before Betty. But Betty is available from 19:00. If we meet Steven from 19:30 to 21:00, but Betty's window is 19:00-20:30. So overlapping.\n\nWait, if we meet Steven first: from 19:30 to 21:00 (90 min). But Betty is available until 20:30. So after Steven ends at 21:00, Betty's time has already passed.\n\nAlternatively, meet Betty from 19:00 to 20:30, then go to Steven. But as before, not enough time.\n\nSo Steven seems impossible to fit unless we sacrifice others.\n\nAnother idea: after Kenneth, instead of meeting Joseph or Joshua, go to Betty and Steven.\n\nBut Kenneth ends at 14:00. Then travel to Haight-Ashbury. From Nob Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 13 min. Arrive 14:13. Betty isn't available until 19:00. So that's a long wait. Not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, after Kenneth, go to meet Joseph until 4:45 PM, then meet Betty from 19:00. But there's a gap between 4:45 PM and 19:00. Can we meet anyone else? Barbara is available from 20:45. Melissa from 20:15. So no. So this gap is wasted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Joshua after Joseph. But as before, not enough time.\n\nSo the maximum number of people seems to be 7: Kimberly, Brian, Kenneth, Joseph/Joshua, Betty, Melissa, Barbara.\n\nNow, let's check the required durations:\n\n- Kimberly: 15 minutes (met)\n- Brian: 45 (met)\n- Kenneth: 105 (met)\n- Joseph: 75 (if included)\n- Joshua: 105 (if included)\n- Betty: 90 (met)\n- Melissa: 30 (met)\n- Barbara: 15 (met)\n- Steven: 90 (not met)\n\nSo either Joseph or Joshua can be included, but not both.\n\nNow, which one to choose? The user wants to meet as many friends as possible. Including Joseph or Joshua would both add 1, making total 7. So maybe prioritize based on which allows more flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to meet both Joseph and Joshua by adjusting the schedule.\n\nWait, after Kenneth ends at 14:00 PM, go to Joseph. Meet from 15:30-16:45 PM (75 min). Then go to Presidio (20 min), arrive 17:05 PM. Joshua is available until 18:15 PM. Meet from 17:05 PM to 18:15 PM (70 min). Not enough. So Joshua can't be met.\n\nBut maybe split Joseph's meeting into two parts? No, the user has to meet for a minimum of 75 minutes continuously.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meet Joseph from 15:30 PM to 16:45 PM, then go to Presidio, meet Joshua from 16:45 PM to 18:15 PM (90 min). But Joshua needs 105 min. So still 15 minutes short.\n\nAlternatively, if we meet Joshua first, then Joseph.\n\nAfter Kenneth ends at 14:00 PM, go to Presidio (17 min), arrive 14:17 PM. Wait until 16:30 PM. Meet Joshua from 16:30 PM to 18:15 PM (105 min). Then go to Joseph (20 min), arrive 18:35 PM. Joseph is available until 19:30 PM. Meet from 18:35 PM to 19:50 PM (75 min). But Joseph is available until 19:30 PM. So meeting from 18:35 PM to 19:30 PM (55 min). Not enough. So this doesn't work.\n\nSo it's impossible to meet both Joseph and Joshua. So the user has to choose one.\n\nNow, considering the time constraints, Joseph is available until 7:30 PM, which is later. But Joshua's slot ends earlier. So perhaps meet Joseph.\n\nLet's proceed with including Joseph.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Kimberly: 9:10-9:25 AM\n2. Brian: 9:30-10:15 AM\n3. Kenneth: 12:15 PM-2:00 PM\n4. Joseph: 3:30 PM-4:45 PM\n5. Betty: 7:00 PM-8:30 PM\n6. Melissa: 8:36 PM-9:06 PM\n7. Barbara: 9:14 PM-9:29 PM\n\nThis totals 7 people. But wait, after Joseph ends at 4:45 PM, there's a gap until Betty's meeting at 7:00 PM. Can we meet someone else during that time?\n\nSteven is available from 7:30 PM. But after meeting Betty from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM, Steven can't be met. Barbara is available from 8:45 PM. So no, during the gap from 4:45 PM to 7:00 PM, no one is available.\n\nAlternatively, after Joseph, go to Betty's location (Haight-Ashbury). Embarcadero to Haight-Ashbury is 21 min. Arrive at 5:06 PM. Wait until 7:00 PM. Then meet until 8:30 PM. Then proceed to Melissa and Barbara.\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nSo the final itinerary would be:\n\nKimberly, Brian, Kenneth, Joseph, Betty, Melissa, Barbara. 7 people.\n\nAlternatively, if we include Joshua instead of Joseph, we can meet Joshua, Betty, Melissa, Barbara. Also 7.\n\nSo the maximum possible is 7. Now, let's check the travel times to ensure there's enough time between meetings.\n\nFor example, after meeting Brian at Fisherman's Wharf until 10:15 AM, travel to Nob Hill (11 min). Arrive at 10:26 AM. Then wait until 12:15 PM to meet Kenneth. That's correct.\n\nAfter Kenneth ends at 2:00 PM, travel to Embarcadero (9 min). Arrive at 2:09 PM. Wait until 3:30 PM. Then meet Joseph until 4:45 PM.\n\nThen travel to Haight-Ashbury: Embarcadero to Haight-Ashbury is 21 min. Arrive at 5:06 PM. Wait until 7:00 PM. Meet Betty until 8:30 PM.\n\nThen to The Castro: Haight-Ashbury to The Castro is 6 min. Arrive 8:36 PM. Meet Melissa until 9:06 PM.\n\nThen to Alamo Square: The Castro to Alamo Square is 8 min. Arrive 9:14 PM. Meet Barbara until 9:29 PM.\n\nAll travel times accounted for. Each meeting fits within the person's availability and meets the minimum duration.\n\nSo this itinerary meets 7 friends. The others (Joshua, Steven) can't be fit in due to time conflicts.",
