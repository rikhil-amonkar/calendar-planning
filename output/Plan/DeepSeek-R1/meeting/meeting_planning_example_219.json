            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule meetings with Emily, Barbara, and William in San Francisco, considering their availability and travel times. The user starts at The Castro at 9:00 AM. Let's break down the constraints and figure out the best schedule.\n\nFirst, Emily is at Alamo Square from 11:45 AM to 3:15 PM, and we need to meet her for at least 105 minutes (which is 1 hour and 45 minutes). Then Barbara is at Union Square from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM, requiring 60 minutes. William is in Chinatown from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM, needing 105 minutes. \n\nBut wait, Barbara and William's times overlap. Barbara's slot ends at 6:15 PM, and William's starts at 5:15 PM. So maybe we can meet Barbara first, then go to William? Let's check the travel times. From Union Square to Chinatown is 7 minutes. If Barbara ends at 5:45 PM, then travel to Chinatown by 5:52 PM. But William is available until 7 PM. So 5:52 PM to 7 PM gives 68 minutes, but we need 105. That's not enough. Hmm. Alternatively, can we meet William first? But William starts at 5:15 PM. If Barbara is from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM, maybe we can split the time between Barbara and William. But how?\n\nWait, maybe it's impossible to meet both Barbara and William because their time windows overlap and the required durations add up to 60 + 105 = 165 minutes. Barbara's window is 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM (90 minutes), and William's is 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 minutes). So meeting Barbara for 60 minutes would need to start by 5:15 PM (since 5:15 PM start would end at 6:15 PM). But then William's earliest start is 5:15 PM, but after Barbara's meeting, you have to travel from Union Square to Chinatown (7 minutes). So if Barbara's meeting ends at 6:15 PM, travel to Chinatown arrives at 6:22 PM, and William's available until 7 PM. 6:22 PM to 7 PM is only 38 minutes, which is way less than the required 105. So that's a problem. Therefore, maybe we can only meet two of the three? But the problem says \"meet as many friends as possible,\" so maybe all three if possible. Wait, perhaps there's a way to meet Barbara and William by overlapping?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can meet Barbara first from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM (60 minutes), then leave Union Square at 5:45 PM, take 7 minutes to Chinatown, arriving at 5:52 PM. Then meet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM, which is 68 minutes. But that's not enough for his 105. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, meet William first. But William's time starts at 5:15 PM. If we start at 5:15 PM, meet until 7:00 PM, that's 105 minutes (5:15 to 7:00 is 1h45m). But Barbara's window is 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM. So if we meet Barbara first, then William, but Barbara's meeting would have to end by 5:15 PM minus travel time. Wait, let's think again.\n\nWait, let's first handle Emily. Emily is at Alamo Square from 11:45 AM to 3:15 PM. We need to meet her for 105 minutes. Let's plan that. The user starts at The Castro at 9 AM. The travel time from The Castro to Alamo Square is 8 minutes. So the earliest arrival at Alamo Square is 9:08 AM, but Emily isn't available until 11:45 AM. So the user has time from 9 AM until 11:45 AM. They could do something else, but since the goal is to meet friends, maybe they just wait until Emily is available. So the user would leave The Castro at a time to arrive at Alamo Square when Emily is there. So to meet Emily for 105 minutes, the latest they can start is 3:15 PM minus 1h45m = 1:30 PM. So the meeting with Emily must start between 11:45 AM and 1:30 PM. Let's pick the earliest start time to maximize time for others. Suppose they start at 11:45 AM. Then the meeting ends at 1:30 PM (11:45 + 1h45m = 13:30). Then after that, they need to go to the next location.\n\nAfter Emily, where to next? The next meetings are Barbara and William. Let's see. The user is at Alamo Square after meeting Emily. From Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 minutes. If they leave Alamo Square at 1:30 PM, they arrive at Union Square at 1:44 PM. But Barbara is only available starting at 4:45 PM. So there's a gap here. Alternatively, maybe they can go somewhere else. But Barbara and William are the other two. So maybe they can use that time to go to another location, but since there's no other friends mentioned, perhaps the user just waits. But maybe it's better to plan to go to Union Square later. Alternatively, after Emily, maybe they can go to Chinatown first? But William is there later. Let's see.\n\nWait, Barbara is at Union Square from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM. So after Emily, the user has from 1:30 PM to 4:45 PM (3 hours and 15 minutes) free. But travel time from Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 minutes, so maybe the user can do something else during that time. But since no other friends are mentioned, perhaps the user just waits until Barbara's time.\n\nBut Barbara needs 60 minutes. Let's say the user leaves Alamo Square at 1:30 PM. They can go to Union Square, arriving at 1:44 PM, but Barbara isn't there until 4:45 PM. So they wait there for over 3 hours. Alternatively, maybe they can go to another location and then come back. But maybe that's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps after Emily, the user can go somewhere else, like Chinatown, but William is only available starting at 5:15 PM. So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to meet Barbara and William both. Let's see. After Emily's meeting ends at 1:30 PM, the user is at Alamo Square. They have time until Barbara's availability at 4:45 PM. Let's see the travel times. From Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 minutes, so leaving at 1:30 PM, arrive at 1:44 PM. But Barbara isn't there until 4:45 PM. So perhaps the user stays in Alamo Square until closer to Barbara's time. Alternatively, maybe go somewhere else. But maybe not. Let's think about the schedule:\n\nEmily: 11:45 AM - 1:30 PM at Alamo Square.\n\nThen, after that, the user has to go to Union Square for Barbara (4:45 PM start). So they can leave Alamo Square, say, at 4:31 PM (travel time 14 minutes) to arrive at 4:45 PM. But wait, that would require leaving Alamo Square at 4:31 PM. But that leaves 1:30 PM to 4:31 PM (3 hours and 1 minute) free. So maybe the user can go somewhere else during that time, but there's no other friends to meet. So perhaps they just stay in Alamo Square or explore until it's time to go to Union Square.\n\nThen, meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM (60 minutes). Then, after that, travel to Chinatown (7 minutes from Union Square) arrives at 5:52 PM. Then meet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM. That's 68 minutes, which is less than the required 105. So that's not enough. Alternatively, can we adjust the meeting with Barbara to end earlier so that we can meet William longer?\n\nWait, Barbara's window is 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM. If we start Barbara's meeting at 4:45 PM and end at 5:45 PM (60 minutes), then travel to Chinatown arrives at 5:52 PM. William's window is until 7 PM. So 5:52 to 7 PM is 68 minutes. Not enough. Alternatively, if we start Barbara's meeting later, but she has to end by 6:15 PM. If we meet Barbara from 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM (60 minutes), then leave at 6:15 PM, arrive in Chinatown at 6:22 PM. Then meet William until 7 PM (38 minutes). Still not enough. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe skip Barbara and meet William. Let's see. If after Emily, the user goes from Alamo Square to Chinatown. The travel time is 16 minutes. Let's say they leave Alamo Square at 1:30 PM, arrive at Chinatown at 1:46 PM. But William is only available from 5:15 PM. So that's a lot of waiting. Alternatively, can they meet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 minutes). But then Barbara's window is 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM. So maybe meet Barbara first, then William. But as before, the time isn't sufficient.\n\nWait, maybe the user can split the time between Barbara and William. For example, meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM (60 minutes), then travel to Chinatown (7 minutes) arriving at 5:52 PM, meet William until 7:00 PM (68 minutes). But that's 68, which is less than 105. So William's not met for the required time. Alternatively, meet William first. But William's earliest start is 5:15 PM. If the user arrives at 5:15 PM, then they need to leave Union Square by 5:08 PM (travel time 7 minutes from Union Square to Chinatown). So to meet Barbara first, the user would have to leave Union Square by 5:08 PM to reach Chinatown by 5:15 PM. But Barbara's meeting would have to start at 4:45 PM and end by 5:08 PM. That's only 23 minutes, which is less than the required 60. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm. It seems like the user can't meet both Barbara and William because their time windows and required durations clash. So perhaps the user has to choose between Barbara and William. Since William requires 105 minutes and Barbara requires 60, but Barbara's window is shorter, maybe the optimal is to meet Emily and Barbara, or Emily and William. Let's check both options.\n\nOption 1: Meet Emily and Barbara. Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM. Then go to Union Square. Wait until Barbara's time. Meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM. Then there's time left, but William can't be met. Total two meetings.\n\nOption 2: Meet Emily and William. After Emily, go from Alamo Square to Chinatown. Let's see. Emily ends at 1:30 PM. Travel to Chinatown takes 16 minutes (Alamo to Chinatown). Arrive at 1:46 PM. But William isn't there until 5:15 PM. So the user has to wait until 5:15 PM. Then meet until 7:00 PM (105 minutes). So that's possible. But then Barbara's window is missed. So total two meetings.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to meet all three? Let's think again.\n\nWait, after meeting Emily, the user is at Alamo Square at 1:30 PM. They have until Barbara's time at 4:45 PM. The user could perhaps go to another location, but there's no friends there. But perhaps they can use that time to go to Union Square early and wait. Then meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM. Then go to Chinatown. Let's calculate the times again.\n\nAfter Emily: 1:30 PM. Then leave Alamo Square at, say, 4:31 PM (14 minutes to Union Square, arrive at 4:45 PM). Meet Barbara 4:45-5:45 PM. Then travel to Chinatown (7 minutes), arrive 5:52 PM. Meet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM (68 minutes). That's not enough. But maybe if the user can leave Barbara's meeting earlier? For example, meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:30 PM (45 minutes), which is less than required. So that's not acceptable. So no.\n\nAlternatively, can the user meet Barbara and William in overlapping time? For example, meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM, then meet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM. But the required 105 for William is not met. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, can the user meet William first, then Barbara? Let's see. William's meeting is from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 minutes). So starting at 5:15 PM. To get there, the user must arrive by 5:15 PM. Let's see. After Emily's meeting ends at 1:30 PM, the user is at Alamo Square. They need to go to Chinatown. The travel time from Alamo Square to Chinatown is 16 minutes. So leaving at 5:00 PM, arriving at 5:16 PM. Then meet William from 5:16 PM to 6:59 PM (103 minutes), which is close but not enough. Alternatively, leave earlier. If they leave Alamo Square at 4:59 PM, arrive at 5:15 PM. Then meet William until 7:00 PM (105 minutes). That works. But then Barbara's window is 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM. So during William's meeting, Barbara's time is 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM. So if the user is meeting William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM, they can't meet Barbara. So this way, they meet Emily and William, but not Barbara. So two meetings.\n\nAlternatively, could the user split the time between Barbara and William? For example, meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM (30 minutes), then go to Chinatown (7 minutes), arriving at 5:22 PM, meet William until 7:00 PM (98 minutes). But Barbara requires 60 minutes, so that's not enough. Similarly, meeting Barbara for 60 minutes would end at 5:45 PM, then William starts at 5:52 PM (after travel) and ends at 7:00 PM (68 minutes). Not enough.\n\nSo, it's impossible to meet all three friends given the time constraints. Therefore, the optimal schedule is to meet Emily and either Barbara or William. Which option allows meeting both Barbara and William? It seems not possible, so the next best is to meet two friends.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let's re-examine the travel times. Maybe there's a way to meet Emily, then Barbara, and then William with some clever scheduling. Let me try again.\n\nEmily's meeting: 11:45 AM - 1:30 PM at Alamo Square.\n\nAfter that, the user is at Alamo Square. They can leave at 1:30 PM. Let's see when Barbara's time starts at 4:45 PM. So from 1:30 PM to 4:45 PM, that's 3h15m. The user can spend that time traveling to another location and maybe do something else, but no other friends are mentioned. So maybe they can go to Union Square early and wait. Let's say they leave Alamo Square at 4:31 PM (14 minutes to Union Square), arriving at 4:45 PM. Meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM (60 minutes). Then travel to Chinatown (7 minutes), arriving at 5:52 PM. Meet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM (68 minutes). Not enough. Alternatively, if they can leave Barbara's meeting earlier. Suppose they meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:30 PM (45 minutes), but that's less than the required 60. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can leave Alamo Square earlier after Emily's meeting. For example, if Emily's meeting ends at 1:30 PM, the user could go to Chinatown directly. Travel time from Alamo Square to Chinatown is 16 minutes. Arrive at 1:46 PM. Then wait until 5:15 PM to meet William. That's a long wait, but then they can meet William for 105 minutes (5:15 PM to 7:00 PM). Then Barbara's meeting would be missed. So two meetings again.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to meet Barbara and William both? Let's check their time windows again. Barbara is available from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM (90 minutes). William is available from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 minutes). The required durations are 60 and 105. So Barbara needs 60 minutes, William needs 105. The overlap between their windows is from 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM. So if the user starts with Barbara at 4:45 PM, meets her until 5:45 PM (60 minutes), then goes to William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM (68 minutes). Not enough. Alternatively, start with William at 5:15 PM, meet him until 7:00 PM (105), but Barbara's window ends at 6:15 PM. So if the user meets Barbara after William, but Barbara's time ends at 6:15 PM. Let's see: William's meeting ends at 7:00 PM, but Barbara is available until 6:15 PM. No. So impossible.\n\nThus, the user can only meet two friends. Between Barbara and William, which one can be fit in after Emily? Let's see:\n\nOption 1: Emily (11:45-1:30) + Barbara (4:45-5:45). Total two meetings.\n\nOption 2: Emily (11:45-1:30) + William (5:15-7:00). Total two meetings.\n\nWhich option is better? Both are two meetings. But the problem states \"meet as many friends as possible,\" so both options are equal. However, perhaps there's a way to fit both Barbara and William. Let's check the travel times again.\n\nWait, after meeting Emily, the user is at Alamo Square at 1:30 PM. They have until Barbara's time at 4:45 PM. Could they go to another location and do something else? Not mentioned. Maybe they can go to Union Square early and wait. So leave Alamo Square at 1:30 PM, arrive at Union Square at 1:44 PM (14 minutes). Wait until Barbara's time at 4:45 PM. Then meet Barbara from 4:45-5:45 PM. Then go to Chinatown (7 minutes), arrive at 5:52 PM. Meet William until 7:00 PM (68 minutes). But William needs 105. So that's not possible. Alternatively, if the user can leave Alamo Square later. Suppose they wait until closer to Barbara's time, leave Alamo Square at 4:31 PM to arrive at Union Square at 4:45 PM. Meet Barbara until 5:45 PM, then to Chinatown. Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, can the user meet Barbara for 60 minutes starting at 4:45 PM, then leave at 5:45 PM, go to Chinatown (7 minutes), arrive at 5:52 PM. Meet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM (68 minutes). So total time with William is 68, which is less than 105. So William's meeting is not possible. \n\nAnother angle: What if the user meets Emily for a shorter duration? No, the requirement is a minimum of 105 minutes. So no. The user must meet Emily for exactly 105 minutes.\n\nHmm. It seems impossible to meet all three friends. Therefore, the optimal solution is to meet Emily and either Barbara or William. But which one allows for more total meeting time? Emily's 105, Barbara's 60, William's 105. So meeting Emily and William gives more total time (210 minutes) versus Emily and Barbara (165). But the problem states \"meet as many friends as possible,\" so quantity is prioritized. But both options are two friends. So perhaps the user can meet three friends if possible, but in this case, it's not possible. Therefore, the best is to meet two friends. But maybe there's a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, wait. Let's check Barbara's and William's time again. Barbara is available until 6:15 PM, and William starts at 5:15 PM. If the user meets Barbara first from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM, then travels to Chinatown (7 minutes), arrives at 5:52 PM. William's available until 7 PM. So 5:52 PM to 7 PM is 68 minutes. But the user needs 105. Not enough. But what if the user meets William first? Let's see:\n\nTo meet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 minutes), the user must arrive by 5:15 PM. So the latest they can leave Alamo Square is 5:15 PM minus travel time from Alamo Square to Chinatown (16 minutes). So leave Alamo Square at 4:59 PM, arrive at 5:15 PM. Then meet William until 7 PM. But during that time, Barbara is available from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM. So if the user is with William from 5:15 PM to 7 PM, they can't meet Barbara. So Barbara is missed. So again, two meetings.\n\nAlternatively, after Emily, the user leaves Alamo Square earlier. For example, meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM. Then leave Alamo Square at 1:30 PM, go to Chinatown (16 minutes, arrive 1:46 PM). Wait until 5:15 PM to meet William. Then after William's meeting, can they meet Barbara? Barbara's window ends at 6:15 PM. So William's meeting ends at 7 PM. No. So no. \n\nWait, perhaps if the user meets William first. Let me think. The user starts at The Castro at 9 AM. They need to meet Emily in Alamo Square. Let's see if they can meet William before Emily. But William is available from 5:15 PM. Emily is available from 11:45 AM. So no, Emily's meeting has to be first.\n\nSo after Emily, the user is at Alamo Square. From there, the options are Barbara or William, but not both. Therefore, the best schedule is to meet Emily and Barbara, or Emily and William. Which one allows for more meetings? Both are two. But since the problem says to meet as many friends as possible, perhaps both options are equal. However, Barbara requires 60 minutes and William requires 105. Maybe it's possible to meet Emily, Barbara, and part of William's time, but that doesn't meet the minimum required. So no.\n\nTherefore, the optimal itinerary is to meet Emily and William. Here's how:\n\nEmily: 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM (105 minutes) at Alamo Square. Then, after that, the user stays in Alamo Square until 5:00 PM. Leaves Alamo Square at 5:00 PM, travels 16 minutes to Chinatown, arrives at 5:16 PM. Then meets William from 5:16 PM to 7:00 PM (104 minutes). But that's one minute short. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, leave Alamo Square at 5:00 PM, arrive at 5:16 PM. But William's available until 7:00 PM. 5:16 PM to 7:00 PM is 104 minutes. Not enough. So maybe the user needs to leave earlier. Leave Alamo Square at 4:59 PM, arrives at 5:15 PM. Meet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 minutes). That works. But how does the user get from Alamo Square to Chinatown in 16 minutes. If they leave at 4:59 PM, arrive at 5:15 PM. Yes, 16 minutes. So that works.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Start at The Castro at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Alamo Square (8 minutes) to arrive at 9:08 AM, but Emily isn't there until 11:45 AM. So wait until 11:45 AM.\n3. Meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM.\n4. Stay at Alamo Square until 4:59 PM, then leave for Chinatown (16 minutes), arriving at 5:15 PM.\n5. Meet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nThis way, Emily and William are met for the required durations.\n\nBut what about Barbara? If the user chooses to meet William, then Barbara is missed. Alternatively, meet Barbara and Emily. Let's see:\n\nEmily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM. Then leave Alamo Square at 4:31 PM (14 minutes to Union Square), arrive at 4:45 PM. Meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM. Then done. So two meetings. \n\nComparing the two options: meeting Emily and William gives total meeting time of 210 minutes, while Emily and Barbara gives 165. So the first option is better in terms of total time, but both are two friends.\n\nBut the problem states to meet as many friends as possible. Since both options result in two meetings, but maybe the schedule can include all three with some overlapping. But I don't see a way. Therefore, the best possible schedule is to meet Emily and William, totaling two friends with the required time. \n\nBut wait, wait. Another angle: Could the user meet Emily, then Barbara, and then a part of William's time, but not meeting the minimum. But the user wants to meet each for their minimum. So that's not acceptable. So the only valid itineraries are those that meet the minimums. \n\nThus, the correct answer is to meet Emily and William. \n\nNow, let's verify the travel times and timing:\n\n- Start at The Castro at 9:00 AM.\n- Need to be at Alamo Square by 11:45 AM. Travel time is 8 minutes. So leave The Castro at 11:37 AM to arrive at 11:45 AM. \n\nWait, this is an important point. The user arrives at The Castro at 9:00 AM, but Emily's meeting is at Alamo Square starting at 11:45 AM. The user must travel from The Castro to Alamo Square (8 minutes). So to arrive at Alamo Square at 11:45 AM, they need to leave The Castro at 11:37 AM. \n\nBut what about the time between 9:00 AM and 11:37 AM? The user is at The Castro. They can't meet anyone else, so they just wait until it's time to leave for Alamo Square.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n- Meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM (105 minutes) at Alamo Square.\n- Then stay at Alamo Square until 4:59 PM (waiting 3 hours and 29 minutes), then travel to Chinatown (16 minutes) arriving at 5:15 PM.\n- Meet William from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 minutes).\n\nThis works. Now, check the constraints:\n\n- Emily's time is 11:45 AM to 3:15 PM. The meeting is scheduled within that window.\n- William's time is 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM. The meeting is scheduled within that window.\n- Travel times are accounted for.\n\nAlternatively, could the user do anything else between 1:30 PM and 4:59 PM? They could go to Union Square early, but Barbara isn't available until 4:45 PM. For example, leave Alamo Square at 1:30 PM, go to Union Square (14 minutes), arrive at 1:44 PM. Wait there until Barbara's time. Then meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM. Then leave for Chinatown (7 minutes) arrive at 5:52 PM. Meet William until 7:00 PM (68 minutes). But that's not enough for William. So no.\n\nTherefore, the only valid itineraries that meet the minimum requirements are either Emily and Barbara, or Emily and William. Between these, Emily and William have longer total meeting time. But the problem says to meet as many friends as possible, and both options are two friends. However, maybe there's a way to meet all three by adjusting the order.\n\nWait, another approach: Could the user meet Emily, then go to Union Square to meet Barbara, then go to Chinatown for William? Let's see:\n\nEmily: 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM at Alamo Square.\n\nThen travel to Union Square (14 minutes), arrive at 1:44 PM. Barbara is available from 4:45 PM. So wait until 4:45 PM. Then meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM. Then travel to Chinatown (7 minutes), arrive at 5:52 PM. Meet William until 7:00 PM (68 minutes). Not enough. So no.\n\nAlternatively, could the user meet Barbara first, then Emily? No, because Emily's time starts at 11:45 AM, and Barbara's time starts at 4:45 PM. So the user starts at The Castro, which is the initial location. So Emily's meeting is the first possible.\n\nHmm. I think the correct answer is to meet Emily and William. Now, let's format this into JSON.",
