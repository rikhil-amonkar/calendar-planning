            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to schedule these meetings. So, the user starts at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM. They need to meet Jason at Presidio for at least 90 minutes, and Kenneth at Marina District for 45 minutes. Let's look at the constraints again.\n\nJason is available from 10:00 AM to 4:15 PM at Presidio. The travel time from Pacific Heights to Presidio is 11 minutes. Since the user is already at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM, maybe they can leave right away. If they leave at 9:00, they'll arrive at Presidio at 9:11 AM. But Jason isn't available until 10:00 AM. So they can't meet Jason before 10. So earliest possible arrival is 9:00 + 11 minutes = 9:11, but have to wait until 10 to start the meeting. Wait, but maybe the user can leave Pacific Heights a bit later. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go to Presidio first. Wait, they start at Pacific Heights. To meet Jason at Presidio, which is 11 minutes away. The earliest possible meeting start time would be 10:00 AM, since that's when Jason is available. So the user can leave Pacific Heights at 9:49 AM to arrive at 10:00. But they are already there at 9:00 AM. Wait, wait, no. Wait, arrival at Pacific Heights is at 9:00 AM, so they can leave whenever. So if they leave Pacific Heights at 9:49, travel 11 minutes, arriving at Presidio at 10:00. Then meet Jason from 10:00 to 11:30 (90 minutes). That works. But then after that, they need to go to Marina District to meet Kenneth. Let's check the times.\n\nKenneth is available from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM. The user needs to meet him for 45 minutes. So possible slots are 3:30-4:15, 3:45-4:30, etc. But the latest possible end time is 4:45 PM. So the meeting must end by 4:45.\n\nBut between meeting Jason and Kenneth, there's travel time. Let's see. After meeting Jason at Presidio until 11:30 AM, the next step is to go to Marina District. Travel time from Presidio to Marina District is 10 minutes. So if they leave Presidio at 11:30, arrive at Marina District at 11:40. But Kenneth isn't available until 3:30 PM. So there's a gap. That's a long time. Maybe that's not optimal. Alternatively, perhaps the user can split their time between the two meetings.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another approach. What if the user first goes to Marina District first after arriving at Pacific Heights? Let's see. From Pacific Heights to Marina District is 6 minutes. If they leave Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM, arrive at Marina District at 9:06 AM. But Kenneth is only there from 3:30 PM. So that's not possible. So that's not useful. So Marina District isn't available until later.\n\nSo maybe the best is to meet Jason first. Let's try to maximize the time with Jason. Let's see. Jason is available from 10:00 AM to 4:15 PM. The user needs 90 minutes. Let's schedule Jason's meeting first. If they start at 10:00 AM, end at 11:30 AM. Then, they can go to Marina District. Travel time is 10 minutes from Presidio to Marina District. Arrive at 11:40 AM. But Kenneth is not available until 3:30 PM. So there's a long gap. That's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Jason later. For example, start the meeting with Jason at 2:45 PM, end at 4:15 PM (90 minutes). Then, after that, travel to Marina District (10 minutes), arrive at 4:25 PM. But Kenneth is available until 4:45 PM. So they can meet from 4:25 to 4:45 PM. That's 20 minutes, which is less than the required 45 minutes. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm. So maybe splitting the day into two parts. Meet Jason first, then go somewhere else, but since Kenneth is only available later, maybe go back to Presidio again. Wait, but the user can't meet Jason twice. So perhaps the user can meet Jason in the morning, then go somewhere else (like back to Pacific Heights?), but there's no other meetings there. Alternatively, after meeting Jason in the morning, spend the time in Marina District waiting until 3:30 PM. But that's a long wait. Alternatively, maybe meet Jason for part of the time in the morning, then go to Marina District for Kenneth, but then return to Presidio again. But that might not be efficient.\n\nWait, let's think again. The user needs to meet both Jason and Kenneth. The constraints are:\n\n- Start at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM.\n\n- Jason is at Presidio 10:00 AM - 4:15 PM, needs 90 min.\n\n- Kenneth is at Marina District 3:30 PM -4:45 PM, needs 45 min.\n\nTravel times:\n\nFrom Presidio to Marina is 10 min.\n\nMarina to Presidio is 10 min.\n\nSo the user has to fit both meetings in, considering travel.\n\nPossible schedule:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Meet Jason from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (90 min). Then travel to Marina (10 min), arrive 11:40 AM. But then wait until 3:30 PM for Kenneth. That's 3 hours and 50 minutes of waiting. Not ideal.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Meet Kenneth first. But Kenneth is available from 3:30 PM. So if the user can schedule to meet Kenneth at 3:30 PM, then they need to get to Marina District by 3:30. The user starts at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM. Let's see: After 9 AM, user can go to Presidio to meet Jason. Suppose they meet Jason from 10 AM to 11:30 AM. Then, they have time until 3:30 PM to do something. But to meet Kenneth at 3:30, they need to leave Presidio (if they are there) and travel to Marina, which is 10 minutes. So they can leave Presidio as late as 3:20 PM to arrive at Marina at 3:30. Then meet Kenneth from 3:30 to 4:15 PM (45 minutes). Then, after that, maybe go back to Presidio to meet Jason again? But Jason is available until 4:15 PM. If the user leaves Marina at 4:15 PM, travels to Presidio (10 min), arrives at 4:25 PM, but Jason is only there until 4:15 PM. So that's too late. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, but after meeting Kenneth from 3:30 to 4:15 PM, the user can't meet Jason again because Jason leaves at 4:15 PM. So Option 2 would be:\n\n9:00 AM at Pacific Heights.\n\nTravel to Presidio (11 min), arriving at 9:11 AM. But Jason is there from 10 AM. So they can wait until 10 AM to start meeting.\n\nWait, if they leave Pacific Heights at 9:49 AM (11 minutes travel), arrive at Presidio at 10:00 AM. Then meet Jason until 11:30 AM. Then go to Marina District (10 min travel), arriving at 11:40 AM. Then wait until 3:30 PM to meet Kenneth. That's a long wait. But perhaps that's the only way. Then meet Kenneth from 3:30 to 4:15 PM (45 minutes). That works. So the itinerary would be:\n\n- Meet Jason at Presidio from 10:00 to 11:30.\n\n- Then go to Marina District (arrive 11:40, but wait until 3:30).\n\n- Meet Kenneth from 3:30 to 4:15.\n\nBut the user has to account for the time in between. However, the problem states that the user wants to meet as many friends as possible. In this case, both are met. So that's the maximum. But the user has to wait from 11:40 AM to 3:30 PM. That's 3 hours and 50 minutes of downtime. Not great, but it's the only option given the constraints.\n\nIs there a better way? Let's see.\n\nAnother possibility: Could the user meet Kenneth first? But Kenneth is only available from 3:30 PM. So the user would need to go to Marina District after 3:30 PM. Let's see:\n\nIf the user starts at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM. They need to meet Jason (90 min) and Kenneth (45 min). So perhaps meet Jason in the afternoon, then go to Marina.\n\nFor example:\n\nMeet Jason from 2:45 PM to 4:15 PM (90 min). Then travel to Marina District (10 min), arrive at 4:25 PM. But Kenneth is available until 4:45 PM. So meeting would be 4:25 to 4:45 PM (20 min), which is less than the required 45 minutes. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, meet Jason from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM. Then travel to Marina District (10 min), arrive 3:10 PM. But Kenneth isn't available until 3:30. So wait until 3:30 PM, meet from 3:30 to 4:15 PM (45 min). That works. Let's check:\n\nStart at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM. How to schedule Jason's meeting.\n\nTo meet Jason from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, the user would need to arrive at Presidio by 1:30 PM. They are starting at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM. So they can spend the morning elsewhere. Wait, but they have to be at Presidio for Jason's meeting. Let's see: If they go from Pacific Heights to Presidio at 1:19 PM (11 minutes travel), arriving at 1:30 PM. Then meet until 3:00 PM. Then leave Presidio at 3:00 PM, travel to Marina (10 min), arrive 3:10 PM. Wait until 3:30 PM, meet Kenneth until 4:15 PM. That works.\n\nBut how does the user spend the time from 9:00 AM to 1:30 PM? They could stay in Pacific Heights, but there's no other meetings there. So they have free time. But the problem is to meet as many friends as possible. But in this case, both are met. The first schedule meets both with a lot of downtime. The second schedule also meets both but with less downtime. Wait, in the first schedule, downtime is from 11:40 AM to 3:30 PM (3h50m). In the second schedule, the user is at Pacific Heights from 9:00 AM to 1:19 PM (when they leave for Presidio). That's 4 hours and 19 minutes of downtime. That's worse. So the first schedule is better in terms of less downtime.\n\nSo the first option seems better. Let me confirm:\n\nItinerary:\n\n1. Start at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM. Leave at 9:49 AM (11 minutes to arrive at Presidio at 10:00 AM).\n\n   Meet Jason from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM.\n\n2. Leave Presidio at 11:30 AM, travel to Marina District (10 minutes), arrive 11:40 AM.\n\n   Then wait until 3:30 PM to meet Kenneth from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM (45 minutes).\n\nThis way, both meetings are scheduled with required durations, and all constraints are met.\n\nAnother possibility: Can the user meet Jason after meeting Kenneth? Let's see. But Kenneth's meeting ends at 4:15 PM, and Jason is available until 4:15 PM. So if they leave Marina at 4:15 PM, travel to Presidio (10 min), arrive 4:25 PM, which is after Jason's availability. So no.\n\nAnother angle: What if the user splits the meeting with Jason into two parts? Like meet Jason for 45 minutes, then go to meet Kenneth, then return. But the problem states that the user must meet Jason for a minimum of 90 minutes. So splitting isn't allowed. So the meeting with Jason has to be a continuous block.\n\nSo the only viable option is the first itinerary. Therefore, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Presidio\", \"person\": \"Jason\", \"start_time\": \"10:00\", \"end_time\": \"11:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Marina District\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:15\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nBut wait, in 24-hour format, 3:30 PM is 15:30, and 4:15 PM is 16:15. That's correct.\n\nAlso, check travel times. From Presidio to Marina District is 10 minutes. So after ending at 11:30, they take 10 minutes to arrive at 11:40. Then they wait until 15:30 (3:30 PM) to meet Kenneth. The meeting with Kenneth starts at 15:30 and ends at 16:15, which is 45 minutes. So that's valid.\n\nYes, this meets all constraints. So this is the correct solution.",
