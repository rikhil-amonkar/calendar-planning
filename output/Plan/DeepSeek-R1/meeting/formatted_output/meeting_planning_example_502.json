            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. I need to maximize the number of friends met while respecting travel times and constraints. Let me start by listing all the people with their availability and required meeting durations.\n\nFirst, the arrival time is 9:00 AM at the Financial District. The friends are:\n\n1. **Joseph** at Pacific Heights from 8:15 AM to 9:30 AM. Needs 60 minutes. But I arrive at 9:00 AM, so can I meet him? Wait, he's available until 9:30 AM. The travel time from Financial District to Pacific Heights is 13 minutes. If I leave at 9:00 AM, arrive at 9:13 AM. Then meet until 10:13 AM. But Joseph is only available until 9:30 AM. So the meeting would have to end by 9:30 AM. So maximum possible is 17 minutes (9:13 to 9:30). But he needs 60 minutes. That's impossible. So Joseph can't be met. Hmm, maybe I should skip Joseph.\n\n2. **Rebecca** at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00 AM to 11:15 AM. Needs 30 minutes. I arrive at Financial District at 9:00 AM. Travel time to Fisherman's Wharf is 10 minutes. So leave at 9:00, arrive 9:10. Then meet from 9:10 to 9:40 (30 minutes). That works because Rebecca is there until 11:15 AM. So Rebecca is possible.\n\n3. **Stephanie** at Golden Gate Park from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Needs 105 minutes (1h45m). That's a big chunk. Need to schedule during her window.\n\n4. **Karen** at Chinatown from 1:45 PM to 4:30 PM. Needs 15 minutes. Short meeting.\n\n5. **Brian** at Union Square from 3:00 PM to 5:15 PM. Needs 30 minutes.\n\n6. **Steven** at North Beach from 2:30 PM to 8:45 PM. Needs 120 minutes. That's a long meeting. But maybe can be split or scheduled later.\n\nLet me start by trying to fit in the longest required meetings first. Stephanie needs 105 minutes, Steven 120, Joseph can't be met. So prioritize Stephanie and Steven.\n\nBut let's see the order. Let's start from the arrival at Financial District at 9:00 AM.\n\nFirst, Rebecca is available until 11:15 AM. Let's meet her first. From Financial District to Fisherman's Wharf is 10 minutes. So leave at 9:00, arrive 9:10. Meet until 9:40 (30 minutes). Then, after Rebecca, where to go next? Next possible is Stephanie at Golden Gate Park. But Stephanie is available from 11:00 AM. So between 9:40 AM and 11:00 AM, there's some time. But travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park takes 25 minutes. If we leave Rebecca at 9:40, arrive at Golden Gate Park at 10:05. But Stephanie isn't available until 11:00 AM. So we have to wait there from 10:05 to 11:00, which is 55 minutes. That's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe use that time to meet someone else. But who? The only other person available before 11:00 AM is Rebecca (until 11:15) and Joseph (until 9:30 AM, which we can't meet). So maybe that time is wasted. Alternatively, perhaps meet Rebecca later? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Rebecca, maybe go to another location. But who else is available? Let's see. Joseph is not possible. The others are available later. So perhaps proceed to Golden Gate Park early and wait until 11:00 AM. But that would mean leaving Rebecca at 9:40, arriving at Golden Gate Park at 10:05, and waiting until 11:00 AM. Then meet Stephanie from 11:00 AM to 12:45 PM (105 minutes). Then after that, need to go to other meetings.\n\nFrom Golden Gate Park, where next? Let's see. The next possible meetings are Karen in Chinatown (1:45 PM to 4:30 PM), Brian in Union Square (3:00 PM to 5:15 PM), and Steven in North Beach (2:30 PM to 8:45 PM).\n\nAfter Stephanie's meeting ends at 12:45 PM, travel time from Golden Gate Park to Chinatown is 23 minutes. So leave at 12:45, arrive at 1:08 PM. But Karen is available from 1:45 PM. So we have 1:08 to 1:45, which is 37 minutes. That's a gap. Alternatively, maybe go somewhere else. But where? Maybe go to North Beach to meet Steven, but he's available from 2:30 PM. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Stephanie, go to Union Square to meet Brian. But Brian is available from 3:00 PM. Let's check travel time. Golden Gate Park to Union Square is 22 minutes. Leaving at 12:45, arrive at 1:07 PM. Then wait until 3:00 PM. That's over 1.5 hours of waiting. Not efficient. Alternatively, maybe schedule Karen first after Stephanie.\n\nWait, Karen is available at 1:45 PM. So after Stephanie ends at 12:45 PM, leave Golden Gate Park at 12:45, arrive in Chinatown at 1:08 PM (23 minutes). Then wait until 1:45 PM (37 minutes) to meet Karen. Then meet her for 15 minutes until 2:00 PM. Then where next? From Chinatown to North Beach is 3 minutes. Steven is available from 2:30 PM. So leaving Chinatown at 2:00 PM, arrive at North Beach at 2:03 PM. Wait until 2:30 PM (27 minutes). Then meet Steven from 2:30 to 4:30 PM (120 minutes). After that, need to meet Brian at Union Square from 3:00 PM to 5:15 PM. Wait, but Steven's meeting ends at 4:30 PM. So after 4:30 PM, go to Union Square. From North Beach to Union Square is 7 minutes (checking travel times: North Beach to Union Square is 7 minutes). Arrive at 4:37 PM. Meet Brian for 30 minutes until 5:07 PM. But Brian's available until 5:15 PM. That works.\n\nBut let's check if the timing works. Let's lay it out:\n\n1. Meet Rebecca: 9:10 AM - 9:40 AM (Fisherman's Wharf)\n   Travel to Golden Gate Park: 25 minutes (9:40-10:05)\n   Wait until 11:00 AM (55 minutes)\n2. Meet Stephanie: 11:00 AM - 12:45 PM (105 minutes)\n   Travel to Chinatown: 23 minutes (12:45-1:08 PM)\n   Wait until 1:45 PM (37 minutes)\n3. Meet Karen: 1:45 PM - 2:00 PM (15 minutes)\n   Travel to North Beach: 3 minutes (2:00-2:03 PM)\n   Wait until 2:30 PM (27 minutes)\n4. Meet Steven: 2:30 PM - 4:30 PM (120 minutes)\n   Travel to Union Square: 7 minutes (4:30-4:37 PM)\n5. Meet Brian: 4:37 PM - 5:07 PM (30 minutes)\n   Brian's window is until 5:15 PM, so this works.\n\nThat seems feasible. Let's check all the constraints:\n\n- Rebecca: Met from 9:10-9:40 (30 minutes) within her 8:00-11:15 AM window.\n- Stephanie: 11:00 AM-12:45 PM (1h45m) in her 11AM-3PM window.\n- Karen: 1:45-2:00 PM (15 minutes) in her 1:45-4:30 PM.\n- Steven: 2:30-4:30 PM (120 minutes) in his 2:30-8:45 PM.\n- Brian: 4:37-5:07 PM (30 minutes) in his 3-5:15 PM.\n\nTotal meetings: Rebecca, Stephanie, Karen, Steven, Brian. That's 5 friends. Joseph is excluded because impossible.\n\nAlternatively, can we fit Steven later and meet Brian earlier?\n\nWait, after meeting Karen at 2:00 PM, instead of going to Steven immediately, maybe go to Brian first. Let's see:\n\nAfter Karen ends at 2:00 PM. From Chinatown to Union Square is 7 minutes (travel time). Arrive at 2:07 PM. Brian is available from 3 PM. So wait until 3 PM (53 minutes). Meet Brian from 3:00-3:30 PM. Then travel to North Beach: Union Square to North Beach is 10 minutes (checking travel times: Union Square to North Beach is 10 minutes). Arrive at 3:40 PM. Meet Steven from 3:40 PM to 5:40 PM (120 minutes). But Steven is available until 8:45 PM, so that's okay. However, this would end at 5:40 PM, but Brian's meeting would end at 3:30 PM. However, this way, Steven's meeting starts later, but perhaps overlapping with Brian's availability. Wait, no, Brian is only available until 5:15 PM. So if we meet Steven from 3:40 to 5:40 PM, but Brian's meeting is until 3:30 PM. Wait, this approach allows meeting Brian, but Steven's meeting would need to end by 5:15 PM? No, because Steven is available until 8:45 PM. So the meeting with Steven can go until 5:40 PM, but Brian's meeting is from 3:00 to 3:30 PM, which is within his window.\n\nBut this way, the Steven meeting is shorter. Wait, no. In the original plan, Steven is met from 2:30-4:30 PM (120 minutes). In the alternative, he's met from 3:40-5:40 PM (also 120). Either way, it's acceptable. But which schedule allows for more efficient travel?\n\nIn the original plan, after Karen, meet Steven, then Brian. In the alternative, meet Brian first, then Steven. Let's compare:\n\nOriginal plan:\n\nKaren ends at 2:00 PM. Travel to North Beach (3 min), wait until 2:30 PM. Meet Steven 2:30-4:30. Then travel to Union Square (7 min), meet Brian 4:37-5:07 PM.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nKaren ends at 2:00 PM. Travel to Union Square (7 min), arrive 2:07. Wait until 3 PM. Meet Brian 3-3:30. Travel to North Beach (10 min), arrive 3:40. Meet Steven 3:40-5:40.\n\nOriginal plan allows Brian to be met later, but the alternative uses more waiting time (53 minutes). The original plan has less waiting time overall. So original plan is better.\n\nAnother alternative: After Stephanie, instead of going to Chinatown, go to North Beach to meet Steven. Let's see.\n\nStephanie ends at 12:45 PM. Travel from Golden Gate Park to North Beach: 24 minutes. Arrive 1:09 PM. Steven is available from 2:30 PM. So wait until 2:30 PM (1:09 to 2:30 is 1h21m). Then meet until 4:30 PM. Then go to Chinatown for Karen. From North Beach to Chinatown is 3 minutes. Arrive 4:33 PM. Karen's available until 4:30 PM. So that's too late. So can't meet Karen. So that's a problem. So this approach misses Karen.\n\nTherefore, the original plan where after Stephanie, go to Chinatown for Karen, then Steven, then Brian is better.\n\nAnother check: After meeting Steven from 2:30-4:30 PM, then travel to Union Square (7 min) arriving 4:37 PM. Brian's available until 5:15 PM. So 4:37 to 5:07 PM is 30 minutes. That works.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Rebecca: 9:10-9:40 (Fisherman's Wharf)\n2. Travel to Golden Gate Park (25 min, arrive 10:05, wait until 11:00)\n3. Meet Stephanie: 11:00-12:45 (Golden Gate Park)\n4. Travel to Chinatown (23 min, arrive 1:08, wait until 1:45)\n5. Meet Karen: 1:45-2:00 (Chinatown)\n6. Travel to North Beach (3 min, arrive 2:03, wait until 2:30)\n7. Meet Steven: 2:30-4:30 (North Beach)\n8. Travel to Union Square (7 min, arrive 4:37)\n9. Meet Brian: 4:37-5:07 (Union Square)\n\nThis schedules Rebecca, Stephanie, Karen, Steven, and Brian. Joseph is excluded. All constraints are met. Let's verify each:\n\n- Rebecca: 30 minutes in her window (8-11:15). 9:10-9:40 is within that.\n- Stephanie: 105 minutes (11-12:45) within 11-3 PM.\n- Karen: 15 minutes (1:45-2:00) within 1:45-4:30.\n- Steven: 120 minutes (2:30-4:30) within 2:30-8:45.\n- Brian: 30 minutes (4:37-5:07) within 3-5:15.\n\nTravel times:\n\n- Financial District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10 min (correct).\n- Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25 min (from data: Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park is 25? Let's check the given travel times. The user said \"Travel distances (in minutes): ... Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25.\" Yes. So correct.\n- Golden Gate Park to Chinatown: 23 min (Golden Gate Park to Chinatown is 23, yes.\n- Chinatown to North Beach: 3 min (Chinatown to North Beach is 3, correct.\n- North Beach to Union Square: 7 min (North Beach to Union Square is 7, yes.\n\nWait times:\n\n- 10:05 AM to 11:00 AM: 55 minutes (unavoidable for Stephanie's meeting).\n- 1:08 PM to 1:45 PM: 37 minutes (waiting for Karen's availability).\n- 2:03 PM to 2:30 PM: 27 minutes (waiting for Steven's availability).\n\nBut all necessary to meet everyone. So this seems the optimal schedule meeting five friends.",
