            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. I need to maximize the number of friends met while respecting all constraints and travel times. Starting at Sunset District at 9 AM. Let's list all the people with their availability and minimum meeting times.\n\nFirst, the constraints:\n\n- Charles: Presidio, 1:15 PM to 3 PM, needs 105 minutes. Wait, that's only 105 minutes from 1:15 to 3 PM. Wait, 1:15 PM to 3 PM is 1 hour and 45 minutes, which is 105 minutes. So exactly fits. So must meet Charles during that entire time. So 1:15-3 PM.\n\nRobert: Nob Hill, 1:15 PM to 5:30 PM, needs 90 minutes. So can fit somewhere in that window, but must have 90 minutes. But since Charles is from 1:15 to 3 PM, perhaps after that?\n\nNancy: Pacific Heights, 2:45 PM to 10 PM, needs 105 minutes. That's 1 hour 45 min.\n\nBrian: Mission District, 3:30 PM to 10 PM, 60 minutes.\n\nKimberly: Marina District, 5-7:45 PM, 75 min.\n\nDavid: North Beach, 2:45-4:30 PM, 75 min.\n\nWilliam: Russian Hill, 12:30-7:15 PM, 120 min.\n\nJeffrey: Richmond District, 12 PM-7:15 PM, 45 min.\n\nKaren: Embarcadero, 2:15-8:45 PM, 60 min.\n\nJoshua: Alamo Square, 6:45-10 PM, 60 min.\n\nStarting at Sunset at 9 AM. Let's think about the order.\n\nFirst, from 9 AM. Let's see who's available earliest. Jeffrey is available from 12 PM. William starts at 12:30 PM. So maybe meet someone before 12 PM?\n\nWait, but starting at 9 AM. Let's see, earliest possible meetings would be with people available in the morning. But according to the constraints, the earliest availability is Jeffrey at 12 PM. Others like Robert start at 1:15 PM. Wait, no. Let me check each person's available time again:\n\nCharles: 1:15-3 PM.\n\nRobert: 1:15-5:30 PM.\n\nNancy: 2:45 PM onward.\n\nBrian: 3:30 PM onward.\n\nKimberly: 5 PM onward.\n\nDavid: 2:45-4:30 PM.\n\nWilliam: 12:30-7:15 PM.\n\nJeffrey: 12 PM-7:15 PM.\n\nKaren: 2:15-8:45 PM.\n\nJoshua: 6:45 PM onward.\n\nSo before 12 PM, no one is available except maybe... wait, the user arrives at Sunset District at 9 AM. Are there any friends available before 12 PM? According to the constraints, Jeffrey is available from 12 PM, so earliest possible is Jeffrey at 12 PM. So from 9 AM to 12 PM, need to plan the first moves.\n\nWait, but starting at 9 AM in Sunset District. So maybe the first meeting is with someone else, but looking at the constraints, all the friends have their available times starting from 12 PM or later. So the earliest possible meeting is Jeffrey at Richmond District, available from 12 PM. So the user needs to travel from Sunset to Richmond District. Travel time is 12 minutes (Sunset to Richmond is 12). So leaving at 11:48 AM would arrive at 12 PM. But that's too early. Alternatively, maybe schedule Jeffrey for 12 PM, but need to account for travel.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can leave at 9 AM, but first go to someone else. But according to the constraints, the earliest availability is Jeffrey at 12 PM and William at 12:30 PM. So between 9 AM and 12 PM, perhaps there's a gap. But since no friends are available during that time, maybe the user has to wait until 12 PM. But that's a long time. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me double-check the constraints again.\n\nLooking back at the constraints:\n\n- Charles: 1:15 PM to 3 PM.\n\n- Robert: 1:15 PM to 5:30 PM.\n\n- Nancy: 2:45 PM to 10 PM.\n\n- Brian: 3:30 PM to 10 PM.\n\n- Kimberly: 5 PM to 7:45 PM.\n\n- David: 2:45 PM to 4:30 PM.\n\n- William: 12:30 PM to 7:15 PM.\n\n- Jeffrey: 12 PM to 7:15 PM.\n\n- Karen: 2:15 PM to 8:45 PM.\n\n- Joshua: 6:45 PM to 10 PM.\n\nSo before 12 PM, no one is available. So the user has from 9 AM to 12 PM free. But since the earliest meeting is Jeffrey at 12 PM, maybe start there.\n\nSo plan:\n\nStart at Sunset District at 9 AM. Travel to Richmond District (Jeffrey's location) which takes 12 minutes. So if leaving at 11:48 AM, arrive at 12:00 PM. Meet Jeffrey from 12:00 PM to 12:45 PM (45 minutes). Then, after that, next meeting.\n\nBut after Jeffrey, where to go next? Let's see. Next possible meetings: William (available from 12:30 PM) at Russian Hill. So maybe from Richmond District to Russian Hill. Travel time is Richmond to Russian Hill: 13 minutes. So leaving at 12:45 PM, arrives at 12:58 PM. But William's available from 12:30 PM. So can meet from 12:58 PM to ... need to meet William for 120 minutes (2 hours). So 12:58 PM start. Then end at 2:58 PM. But then, after that, next meeting.\n\nBut wait, Charles is at Presidio from 1:15 PM to 3 PM. So during that time, Charles must be met for 105 minutes. So if the user is meeting William from 12:58 PM to 2:58 PM, that would overlap with Charles's availability. So that's a problem. So need to adjust.\n\nAlternative approach: Since Charles must be met from 1:15 PM to 3 PM (exactly 105 minutes), the user has to be at Presidio during that time. So the user must travel to Presidio by 1:15 PM.\n\nSo starting at Sunset District (9 AM). From 9 AM until 1:15 PM, the user can maybe meet someone else, but the earliest available is Jeffrey at 12 PM.\n\nSo possible schedule:\n\n9 AM to 12 PM: free time. Then meet Jeffrey at Richmond District from 12 PM to 12:45 PM. Then travel to Presidio (Richmond to Presidio is 7 minutes). Leaving at 12:45 PM, arrive at 12:52 PM. But Charles is available at 1:15 PM. So there's a gap from 12:52 PM to 1:15 PM. Wait, maybe the user can meet Jeffrey until 12:45 PM, then travel to Presidio (7 minutes), arriving at 12:52 PM. Then wait until 1:15 PM to meet Charles. But that leaves 23 minutes of waiting, which isn't efficient. Alternatively, maybe adjust the meeting with Jeffrey.\n\nAlternatively, meet Jeffrey for a shorter time. But the minimum is 45 minutes. So from 12 PM to 12:45 PM. Then travel to Presidio (7 minutes). Arrive at 12:52 PM. Then wait until 1:15 PM. So that's possible, but the waiting time is not ideal. Alternatively, could Jeffrey's meeting be scheduled after Charles? But Charles ends at 3 PM. Jeffrey is available until 7:15 PM. So after 3 PM, could meet Jeffrey. But then, maybe that's better.\n\nSo alternative plan: Meet Charles first from 1:15 PM to 3 PM. Then after that, schedule others.\n\nBut how to get to Presidio by 1:15 PM. The user starts at Sunset District at 9 AM. Let's see: Sunset to Presidio is 16 minutes. So leaving at 1:00 PM, arrive at 1:16 PM, which is late. So need to leave earlier. So to arrive by 1:15 PM, need to depart at 1:15 PM minus 16 minutes = 12:59 PM. So user can leave Sunset at 12:59 PM to arrive at Presidio at 1:15 PM. So from 9 AM to 12:59 PM, they can do other things.\n\nBut during that time, the earliest available is Jeffrey at 12 PM. So maybe meet Jeffrey from 12 PM to 12:45 PM (45 min), then leave Richmond District (Jeffrey's location) to Presidio. Richmond to Presidio is 7 minutes. So leaving at 12:45 PM, arrive at 12:52 PM. Then wait until 1:15 PM to meet Charles. That's 23 minutes of waiting. Not ideal, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet William first. William is available from 12:30 PM. So if the user leaves Sunset earlier, maybe meet William from 12:30 PM, but need to account for travel time.\n\nWait, let's see: Starting at Sunset District at 9 AM. Let's try to fit William in before Charles.\n\nWilliam is at Russian Hill from 12:30 PM. The user needs to get there. Sunset to Russian Hill is 24 minutes. So leaving at 12:06 PM, arrive at 12:30 PM. Then meet William from 12:30 PM to ... but Charles requires meeting at Presidio from 1:15 PM. So the user needs to leave William early enough to get to Presidio by 1:15 PM. Travel time from Russian Hill to Presidio is 14 minutes. So need to leave Russian Hill by 1:01 PM to arrive at Presidio at 1:15 PM. So meeting William from 12:30 PM to 1:01 PM. That's only 31 minutes. But William requires a minimum of 120 minutes. That's impossible. So this approach won't work.\n\nAlternative idea: Split William's meeting into two parts? But the problem states that meetings are to be scheduled once, I think. So need to meet William for 120 minutes in one block.\n\nSo perhaps after Charles.\n\nLet me re-examine the constraints again:\n\nCharles must be met from 1:15 PM to 3 PM. So that's fixed.\n\nSo during 1:15 PM to 3 PM, user is at Presidio.\n\nNow, after 3 PM, the user can go to other places.\n\nLet's think of the schedule:\n\n9 AM - start at Sunset.\n\nPossible actions before 1:15 PM:\n\nJeffrey (Richmond) available from 12 PM. So meet Jeffrey from 12 PM to 12:45 PM (45 min), then travel to Presidio (7 minutes) arriving at 12:52 PM. Then wait until 1:15 PM. Then meet Charles from 1:15 PM to 3 PM.\n\nThen after 3 PM, what's available?\n\nNancy at Pacific Heights (2:45 PM to 10 PM). Need 105 min.\n\nDavid at North Beach (2:45 PM to 4:30 PM). Need 75 min.\n\nKaren at Embarcadero (2:15 PM to 8:45 PM). 60 min.\n\nWilliam at Russian Hill (until 7:15 PM). 120 min.\n\nRobert at Nob Hill (1:15 PM to 5:30 PM). 90 min.\n\nBrian at Mission District (3:30 PM onward). 60 min.\n\nKimberly at Marina (5 PM onward). 75 min.\n\nJoshua at Alamo (6:45 PM onward). 60 min.\n\nSo after 3 PM:\n\nFrom Presidio, after 3 PM, the user can go to another location. Let's look at travel times from Presidio to other places.\n\nPresidio to Pacific Heights: 11 minutes.\n\nPresidio to North Beach: 18 minutes.\n\nPresidio to Embarcadero: 20 minutes.\n\nPresidio to Russian Hill:14 minutes.\n\nPresidio to Nob Hill: 18 minutes.\n\nPresidio to Mission District:26 minutes.\n\nPresidio to Marina:11 minutes.\n\nSo possible next meetings after 3 PM.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption 1: Meet David at North Beach from 3:18 PM (arriving after 18 minutes travel) starting at 3:18 PM. But David is available until 4:30 PM. Need 75 minutes (1h15m). So 3:18 PM to 4:33 PM. But David's availability ends at 4:30 PM. So can only meet until 4:30 PM. So 3:18 PM to 4:30 PM is 72 minutes, which is less than required 75. So not enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Presidio, go to Nob Hill (Robert) which needs 90 minutes. Travel time from Presidio to Nob Hill is 18 minutes. So arrive at 3:18 PM. Robert's available until 5:30 PM. So meeting from 3:18 PM to 4:48 PM (90 minutes). That works. Then after that, maybe Nancy at Pacific Heights (needs 105 min). From Nob Hill to Pacific Heights is 8 minutes. Arrive at 4:56 PM. Meet from 4:56 PM to 6:41 PM (105 minutes). But Nancy is available until 10 PM. Then after that, perhaps Kimberly at Marina (5 PM to 7:45 PM). Wait, if Nancy's meeting ends at 6:41 PM, travel to Marina takes Pacific Heights to Marina District is 6 minutes. Arrive at 6:47 PM. Kimberly is available until 7:45 PM. Meet from 6:47 PM to 8:02 PM (75 minutes). But Kimberly's end time is 7:45 PM. So 6:47 PM to 7:45 PM is 58 minutes, which is less than 75. Not enough. Alternatively, maybe schedule Kimberly earlier.\n\nAlternatively, after Robert, go to Karen at Embarcadero. From Nob Hill to Embarcadero is 9 minutes (Nob Hill to Embarcadero is 9). So arrive at 4:57 PM. Meet Karen for 60 minutes until 5:57 PM. Then go to Kimberly at Marina (Embarcadero to Marina is 12 minutes). Arrive at 6:09 PM. Meet until 7:24 PM (75 min), but Kimberly is available until 7:45 PM. That works (6:09 to 7:24 PM). Then travel to Alamo Square for Joshua. Marina to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. Arrive at 7:39 PM. Meet Joshua from 7:39 PM to 8:39 PM. But Joshua is available from 6:45 PM. So that works. But Joshua's minimum is 60 minutes. So 7:39 PM to 8:39 PM. However, Joshua is available until 10 PM, so that's okay.\n\nBut wait, this schedule includes meeting Charles, Robert, Karen, Kimberly, Joshua. Also, what about William (needs 120 minutes), Nancy (105), Brian (60), David (75). Let's see how many we can fit.\n\nAlternatively, after Presidio (3 PM), go to meet David at North Beach. But earlier calculation shows that's not possible. Let's see:\n\nFrom Presidio to North Beach is 18 minutes. Arrive at 3:18 PM. David's available until 4:30 PM. So meeting from 3:18 PM to 4:30 PM (72 minutes), which is less than the required 75. So can't meet David.\n\nAlternatively, after Presidio, go to Karen at Embarcadero. Travel time 20 minutes. Arrive at 3:20 PM. Meet Karen from 3:20 PM to 4:20 PM. Then go to Robert at Nob Hill (Embarcadero to Nob Hill is 10 minutes). Arrive at 4:30 PM. Robert is available until 5:30 PM. Need 90 minutes. So from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM. But Robert's end time is 5:30 PM. So only 60 minutes. Not enough. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. Maybe after Presidio, meet Nancy at Pacific Heights. Travel time 11 minutes. Arrive at 3:11 PM. Meet Nancy from 3:11 PM to 4:56 PM (105 minutes). Then, from Pacific Heights to Marina District (6 minutes). Arrive at 5:02 PM. Kimberly is available from 5 PM. Meet from 5:02 PM to 6:17 PM (75 minutes). Then go to Alamo Square (Marina to Alamo is 15 minutes). Arrive at 6:32 PM. Joshua is available from 6:45 PM. Wait until 6:45 PM, then meet until 7:45 PM. But Joshua's minimum is 60 minutes. So 6:45 PM to 7:45 PM. Then after that, maybe meet Brian at Mission District. Alamo Square to Mission is 10 minutes. Arrive at 7:55 PM. Meet from 7:55 PM to 8:55 PM. But Brian is available until 10 PM. So that works. Also, William needs 120 minutes. Haven't met him yet. So this approach leaves out Robert, David, William, Jeffrey, and Karen.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible itinerary step by step.\n\nStarting from Sunset District at 9 AM.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- 9 AM to 12 PM: Free time. But since no one is available, perhaps start moving towards Jeffrey at Richmond.\n\n- Meet Jeffrey from 12:00 PM to 12:45 PM (45 min). Then travel to Presidio (7 minutes). Arrive 12:52 PM. Wait until 1:15 PM to meet Charles.\n\n- Meet Charles from 1:15 PM to 3:00 PM. Then travel to next location.\n\nFrom Presidio, after 3 PM, possible options:\n\nOption A: Go to Pacific Heights (11 minutes) to meet Nancy. Arrive 3:11 PM. Meet until 4:56 PM (105 min). Then go to Marina (6 minutes) to meet Kimberly. Arrive 5:02 PM. Meet until 6:17 PM (75 min). Then go to Alamo Square (15 minutes) to meet Joshua. Arrive 6:32 PM. Wait until 6:45 PM. Meet until 7:45 PM. Then go to Mission District (10 minutes) to meet Brian. Arrive 7:55 PM. Meet until 8:55 PM. That's Brian done. Also, check William: needs 120 minutes. He's at Russian Hill from 12:30 PM to 7:15 PM. So maybe after Kimberly, before Joshua, go to William? But after Kimberly ends at 6:17 PM, travel to Russian Hill. Marina to Russian Hill is 8 minutes. Arrive 6:25 PM. Meet William from 6:25 PM to 8:25 PM (120 min). But William is available until 7:15 PM. So can't meet for 120 minutes. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternative: After Nancy, go to William. From Pacific Heights to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. Arrive 4:56 PM + 7 = 5:03 PM. Meet William from 5:03 PM to 7:03 PM (120 min). But William's availability ends at 7:15 PM. So that's possible. Then after William, go to Kimberly. Russian Hill to Marina is 7 minutes. Arrive 7:10 PM. Kimberly's available until 7:45 PM. Meet from 7:10 PM to 7:45 PM (35 minutes), which is less than 75 required. So no good.\n\nAnother idea: After Nancy, go to Robert. Pacific Heights to Nob Hill is 8 minutes. Arrive 4:56 PM + 8 = 5:04 PM. Robert's available until 5:30 PM. Meet from 5:04 PM to 5:30 PM (26 minutes). Not enough. So can't.\n\nOption B: After Charles, go to Robert at Nob Hill. Presidio to Nob Hill is 18 minutes. Arrive 3:18 PM. Meet until 4:48 PM (90 min). Then go to North Beach (Nob Hill to North Beach is 8 minutes). Arrive 4:56 PM. David is available until 4:30 PM. So can't meet. So no.\n\nOption C: After Charles, go to Karen at Embarcadero. Presidio to Embarcadero is 20 minutes. Arrive 3:20 PM. Meet until 4:20 PM. Then go to David at North Beach (Embarcadero to North Beach is 5 minutes). Arrive 4:25 PM. David is available until 4:30 PM. So meet from 4:25 PM to 4:30 PM (5 min). Not enough. Can't.\n\nOption D: After Charles, go to William at Russian Hill. Presidio to Russian Hill is14 minutes. Arrive 3:14 PM. Meet until 5:14 PM (120 min). Then travel to Kimberly at Marina (7 minutes). Arrive 5:21 PM. Meet from 5:21 PM to 6:36 PM (75 min). Then go to Joshua at Alamo (Marina to Alamo is 15 minutes). Arrive 6:51 PM. Meet until 7:51 PM. Then Brian at Mission (Alamo to Mission is 10 minutes). Arrive 8:01 PM. Meet until 9:01 PM. And Nancy? Not met yet. But Nancy's slot was not used here.\n\nThis option includes Charles, William, Kimberly, Joshua, Brian. Missed Robert, David, Karen, Nancy, Jeffrey.\n\nBut Jeffrey was met earlier. So total meetings: Jeffrey, Charles, William, Kimberly, Joshua, Brian. That's 6. Plus Karen, Nancy, Robert, David?\n\nAlternatively, after William, perhaps go to Nancy. Russian Hill to Pacific Heights is 7 minutes. Arrive 5:14 PM +7 =5:21 PM. Meet Nancy from 5:21 PM to 7:06 PM (105 min). Then go to Kimberly at Marina (Pacific Heights to Marina is 6 minutes. Arrive 7:12 PM. Kimberly available until 7:45 PM. Meet from 7:12 PM to 7:45 PM (33 min). Not enough. So can't.\n\nAlternatively, after William (ends 5:14 PM), go to Robert at Nob Hill. Russian Hill to Nob Hill is5 minutes. Arrive 5:19 PM. Meet Robert from 5:19 PM to 6:49 PM (90 min). But Robert's available until 5:30 PM. So can't. So this doesn't work.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe meet William earlier. For example, after Jeffrey, before Charles.\n\nJeffrey: 12-12:45 PM. Then travel to Russian Hill (Richmond to Russian Hill is13 minutes. Arrive 12:58 PM. Meet William from 12:58 PM to 2:58 PM (120 min). Then travel to Presidio (Russian Hill to Presidio is14 minutes. Arrive 3:12 PM. But Charles's meeting is from 1:15 PM to 3 PM. So overlapping. So impossible.\n\nAlternative: Split William's meeting into two parts. But I think the problem expects each person to be met once. So can't split.\n\nAlternative plan: Skip Jeffrey to fit in others.\n\nIf we skip Jeffrey, then after Charles, we can meet more people.\n\nBut Jeffrey's minimum is 45 minutes, which is relatively short. Maybe it's better to include him to maximize the number.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nItinerary:\n\n1. Start at Sunset (9 AM).\n\n2. Meet Jeffrey at Richmond from 12:00 PM to 12:45 PM (45 min). Travel time 12 minutes (Sunset to Richmond). So leave at 11:48 AM to arrive at 12:00 PM.\n\n3. Travel to Presidio (7 minutes). Arrive 12:52 PM. Wait until 1:15 PM.\n\n4. Meet Charles from 1:15 PM to 3:00 PM.\n\n5. Travel to Pacific Heights (11 minutes). Arrive 3:11 PM.\n\n6. Meet Nancy from 3:11 PM to 4:56 PM (105 min).\n\n7. Travel to Marina District (6 minutes). Arrive 5:02 PM.\n\n8. Meet Kimberly from 5:02 PM to 6:17 PM (75 min).\n\n9. Travel to Alamo Square (15 minutes). Arrive 6:32 PM. Wait until 6:45 PM.\n\n10. Meet Joshua from 6:45 PM to 7:45 PM (60 min).\n\n11. Travel to Mission District (10 minutes). Arrive 7:55 PM.\n\n12. Meet Brian from 7:55 PM to 8:55 PM (60 min).\n\nThis itinerary includes Jeffrey, Charles, Nancy, Kimberly, Joshua, Brian. That's 6 people.\n\nWhat about William? He's available from 12:30 PM to 7:15 PM. Can we fit him in somewhere?\n\nAfter meeting Charles (3 PM), perhaps go to William at Russian Hill. Presidio to Russian Hill is14 minutes. Arrive 3:14 PM. Meet until 5:14 PM (120 min). Then go to Nancy: Russian Hill to Pacific Heights is7 minutes. Arrive 5:21 PM. Meet Nancy until 7:06 PM (105 min). Then Kimberly: Pacific Heights to Marina (6 minutes). Arrive 7:12 PM. Meet until 8:27 PM, but Kimberly is available until 7:45 PM. So only 33 minutes. Not enough. Then Joshua: Marina to Alamo (15 minutes) arrive 8:00 PM, but Joshua is available from 6:45 PM. So this would miss Joshua.\n\nAlternatively, after William, meet Robert at Nob Hill. Russian Hill to Nob Hill is5 minutes. Arrive 5:19 PM. Meet until 6:49 PM (90 min). But Robert's available until 5:30 PM. So no.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's count how many people are included in the initial itinerary: Jeffrey, Charles, Nancy, Kimberly, Joshua, Brian: 6.\n\nIf we can fit William instead of someone else.\n\nAlternative itinerary:\n\n1. Sunset to Presidio (16 minutes) arrive 9:16 AM. But no one is available until 12 PM. So wait until 12 PM.\n\nAlternatively, but that's not efficient.\n\nAlternative approach: Skip Jeffrey to include William.\n\nItinerary:\n\n1. Start at Sunset. Go to Presidio for Charles.\n\nLeave at 12:59 PM to arrive at 1:15 PM (Sunset to Presidio:16 minutes). So free time until then.\n\nBut from 9 AM to 12:59 PM, can't meet anyone. So maybe during that time, meet William. But William is available from 12:30 PM. So perhaps:\n\nLeave Sunset at 12:06 PM (24 minutes travel to Russian Hill). Arrive 12:30 PM. Meet William from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM (120 min). Then travel to Presidio (14 minutes). Arrive 2:44 PM. But Charles must be met from 1:15 PM to 3 PM. So this overlaps. So can't.\n\nThus, this approach won't work.\n\nAnother idea: Meet William after Charles. So after Charles ends at 3 PM, go to Russian Hill (14 minutes). Arrive 3:14 PM. Meet until 5:14 PM. Then go to Kimberly (Russian Hill to Marina:7 minutes). Arrive 5:21 PM. Meet until 6:36 PM. Then Joshua (Marina to Alamo:15 minutes. Arrive 6:51 PM. Meet until 7:51 PM. Then Brian (Alamo to Mission:10 minutes. Arrive 8:01 PM. Meet until 9:01 PM. This includes Charles, William, Kimberly, Joshua, Brian: 5 people. Plus Nancy: Not met. Could meet Nancy after William. From William ends at 5:14 PM, go to Pacific Heights (Russian Hill to Pacific Heights:7 minutes). Arrive 5:21 PM. Meet Nancy until 7:06 PM. Then Kimberly is available until 7:45 PM. Travel from Pacific Heights to Marina:6 minutes. Arrive 7:12 PM. Meet until 7:45 PM (33 minutes, not enough). So can't.\n\nSo, this is challenging. Let's see which schedule allows the most meetings.\n\nThe initial itinerary includes Jeffrey, Charles, Nancy, Kimberly, Joshua, Brian (6 people).\n\nAlternatively, skipping Jeffrey to include William and others:\n\nItinerary:\n\n1. Charles: 1:15 PM -3 PM.\n\n2. After Charles, go to William: Presidio to Russian Hill (14 minutes. Arrive 3:14 PM. Meet until 5:14 PM.\n\n3. Then to Kimberly: Russian Hill to Marina (7 minutes. Arrive 5:21 PM. Meet until 6:36 PM.\n\n4. Then to Joshua: Marina to Alamo (15 minutes. Arrive 6:51 PM. Meet until 7:51 PM.\n\n5. Then to Brian: Alamo to Mission (10 minutes. Arrive 8:01 PM. Meet until 9:01 PM.\n\nThis includes Charles, William, Kimberly, Joshua, Brian:5.\n\nIf add Robert after William:\n\nAfter William (ends 5:14 PM), go to Nob Hill (Russian Hill to Nob Hill:5 minutes. Arrive 5:19 PM. Meet Robert until 6:49 PM (90 min). But Robert is available until 5:30 PM. So only 11 minutes. Can't.\n\nAlternatively, after Charles, go to Robert: Presidio to Nob Hill 18 minutes. Arrive 3:18 PM. Meet until 4:48 PM (90 min). Then to Nancy: Nob Hill to Pacific Heights 8 minutes. Arrive 4:56 PM. Meet until 6:41 PM. Then Kimberly: Pacific Heights to Marina 6 minutes. Arrive 6:47 PM. Meet until 7:45 PM (58 minutes, less than 75). So can't. So that gives Charles, Robert, Nancy:3 plus Kimberly (partial), Joshua, Brian.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's go back to the initial plan that includes Jeffrey, Charles, Nancy, Kimberly, Joshua, Brian (6 people), and see if we can fit Karen or David.\n\nAfter meeting Nancy (ends 4:56 PM), next is Kimberly until 6:17 PM. Then Joshua until 7:45 PM. Then Brian until 8:55 PM. Could we fit Karen in somewhere?\n\nFor example, after Brian, go to Embarcadero. Mission to Embarcadero is 19 minutes. Arrive 9:14 PM. But Karen is available until 8:45 PM. So can't.\n\nAlternatively, after Kimberly (ends 6:17 PM), go to Karen. Marina to Embarcadero is14 minutes. Arrive 6:31 PM. Meet until 7:31 PM. Then Joshua: Embarcadero to Alamo Square is19 minutes. Arrive 7:50 PM. Joshua is available until 10 PM. Meet until 8:50 PM. Then Brian: Alamo to Mission 10 minutes. Arrive 9:00 PM. Meet until 10:00 PM.\n\nThis adds Karen. So meetings: Jeffrey, Charles, Nancy, Kimberly, Karen, Joshua, Brian. That's 7. Plus William? No. David? No.\n\nBut what about David? He's available until 4:30 PM. In this schedule, after Nancy ends at 4:56 PM, can we meet David? No, because he's already gone.\n\nAnother possibility: Between Nancy and Kimberly. After Nancy ends at 4:56 PM, go to North Beach (Pacific Heights to North Beach:9 minutes). Arrive 5:05 PM. But David is available until 4:30 PM. So can't.\n\nAlternatively, after Charles (3 PM), go to David at North Beach. Presidio to North Beach:18 minutes. Arrive 3:18 PM. Meet until 4:33 PM (75 min). But David's available until 4:30 PM. So 3:18 PM to 4:30 PM (72 min). Close but not enough. So can't meet David.\n\nHmm. So the initial plan with 6 people seems the best possible.\n\nBut wait, what about Karen? She's available from 2:15 PM to 8:45 PM. Can we fit her in?\n\nIn the initial itinerary after meeting Nancy (4:56 PM), go to Karen at Embarcadero. Pacific Heights to Embarcadero is10 minutes. Arrive 5:06 PM. Meet until 6:06 PM. Then go to Marina (Embarcadero to Marina is12 minutes. Arrive 6:18 PM. Meet Kimberly until 7:33 PM. Then go to Alamo (15 minutes. Arrive 7:48 PM. Meet Joshua until 8:48 PM. Then Brian until 9:48 PM.\n\nThis includes Karen. So meetings: Jeffrey, Charles, Nancy, Karen, Kimberly, Joshua, Brian. 7 people.\n\nBut what about William? Still not met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace Kimberly with William. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Karen (6:06 PM), go to William at Russian Hill (Embarcadero to Russian Hill is8 minutes. Arrive 6:14 PM. Meet until 8:14 PM (120 min). But William is available until 7:15 PM. So only 61 minutes. Not enough.\n\nThis is very challenging. It seems that the maximum number of meetings is 7, including Jeffrey, Charles, Nancy, Karen, Kimberly, Joshua, Brian. But let's check the time.\n\nAfter Charles (3 PM), go to Pacific Heights (11 minutes. Arrive 3:11 PM). Meet Nancy until 4:56 PM. Then to Embarcadero (10 minutes. Arrive 5:06 PM). Meet Karen until 6:06 PM. Then to Marina (12 minutes. Arrive 6:18 PM. Meet Kimberly until 7:33 PM. Then to Alamo (15 minutes. Arrive 7:48 PM. Meet Joshua until 8:48 PM. Then to Mission (10 minutes. Arrive 8:58 PM. Meet Brian until 9:58 PM.\n\nThis works and includes 7 people. So that's better.\n\nBut what about William and Robert? Not included. But we can't fit everyone. So the goal is to maximize the number. 7 is better than 6.\n\nBut wait, does this fit all time constraints?\n\nCheck each meeting:\n\n- Jeffrey: 12:00-12:45 PM (45 min).\n\n- Charles: 1:15-3:00 PM.\n\n- Nancy: 3:11-4:56 PM (105 min).\n\n- Karen: 5:06-6:06 PM (60 min).\n\n- Kimberly: 6:18-7:33 PM (75 min).\n\n- Joshua: 7:48-8:48 PM (60 min).\n\n- Brian: 8:58-9:58 PM (60 min).\n\nTravel times:\n\nSunset to Richmond (12 min) \u2014 left at 11:48 AM, arrive 12:00 PM.\n\nRichmond to Presidio (7 min) \u2014 left at 12:45 PM, arrive 12:52 PM. Wait until 1:15 PM.\n\nPresidio to Pacific Heights (11 min) \u2014 left at 3:00 PM, arrive 3:11 PM.\n\nPacific Heights to Embarcadero (10 min) \u2014 left at 4:56 PM, arrive 5:06 PM.\n\nEmbarcadero to Marina (12 min) \u2014 left at 6:06 PM, arrive 6:18 PM.\n\nMarina to Alamo (15 min) \u2014 left at 7:33 PM, arrive 7:48 PM.\n\nAlamo to Mission (10 min) \u2014 left at 8:48 PM, arrive 8:58 PM.\n\nAll travel times accounted for. This seems possible. But let's check if any overlaps or time issues.\n\nYes, this schedule works. So total meetings: 7. \n\nBut wait, what about David and Robert and William? They are not met. But the goal is to meet as many as possible. 7 seems better than other options.\n\nAlternatively, could we include William instead of Karen?\n\nLet's try:\n\nAfter Nancy (4:56 PM), go to William. Pacific Heights to Russian Hill is7 minutes. Arrive 5:03 PM. Meet until 7:03 PM (120 min). But William is available until 7:15 PM. Then go to Kimberly: Russian Hill to Marina (7 minutes. Arrive 7:10 PM. Meet until 7:45 PM (35 minutes). Not enough. Then Joshua: Marina to Alamo (15 minutes. Arrive 8:00 PM. Meet until 9:00 PM. Then Brian: until 10 PM.\n\nThis includes William, but Kimberly's meeting is cut short, and Karen is skipped. Total meetings: Jeffrey, Charles, Nancy, William, Kimberly (partial), Joshua, Brian. So 6 with Kimberly's time not met. So not good.\n\nThus, including Karen and Kimberly gives us 7.\n\nBut let's check if Karen's meeting is possible. Karen is at Embarcadero from 2:15 PM. The schedule meets her from 5:06 PM to 6:06 PM. That's within her availability. So yes.\n\nAnother check: After meeting Karen at 6:06 PM, travel to Marina District (12 minutes. Arrive 6:18 PM). Kimberly is available from 5 PM. So start meeting at 6:18 PM. Need 75 minutes until 7:33 PM. Ends at 7:33 PM. Then to Alamo (15 minutes. Arrive 7:48 PM. Meet Joshua until 8:48 PM. Then Brian until 9:58 PM.\n\nYes, all within their time slots.\n\nSo this schedule includes 7 people. Are there any other possible meetings? For example, can we meet Robert?\n\nRobert is available until 5:30 PM. If we can fit him in after Karen.\n\nAfter Karen ends at 6:06 PM, it's too late for Robert. So no.\n\nAlternatively, between Nancy and Karen. After Nancy ends at 4:56 PM, go to Robert. Pacific Heights to Nob Hill is8 minutes. Arrive 5:04 PM. Meet until 6:34 PM (90 min). But Robert's available until 5:30 PM. So can't.\n\nSo no. Thus, the maximum seems to be 7.\n\nBut let's re-examine the itinerary to see if there's any way to fit in another person.\n\nFor example, after meeting Jeffrey and before Charles, maybe meet William. Let's see:\n\nJeffrey: 12:00-12:45 PM. Travel to William's location (Richmond to Russian Hill is13 minutes. Arrive 12:58 PM. Meet William until 2:58 PM (120 min). Then travel to Presidio (14 minutes. Arrive 3:12 PM. But Charles's meeting is from 1:15 PM to 3 PM. So this overlaps. So impossible.\n\nThus, the initial plan of 7 people is the best.\n\nNow, let's format this into the required JSON.\n\nThe itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Jeffrey at Richmond District: 12:00-12:45.\n\n2. Meet Charles at Presidio: 1:15-3:00.\n\n3. Meet Nancy at Pacific Heights: 3:11-4:56.\n\n4. Meet Karen at Embarcadero: 5:06-6:06.\n\n5. Meet Kimberly at Marina District: 6:18-7:33.\n\n6. Meet Joshua at Alamo Square: 7:48-8:48.\n\n7. Meet Brian at Mission District: 8:58-9:58.\n\nCheck travel times between each:\n\n- Sunset to Richmond: 12 minutes (left 11:48, arrive 12:00).\n\n- Richmond to Presidio:7 minutes (left 12:45, arrive 12:52).\n\n- Presidio to Pacific Heights:11 minutes (left 3:00, arrive 3:11).\n\n- Pacific Heights to Embarcadero:10 minutes (left 4:56, arrive 5:06).\n\n- Embarcadero to Marina:12 minutes (left 6:06, arrive 6:18).\n\n- Marina to Alamo:15 minutes (left 7:33, arrive 7:48).\n\n- Alamo to Mission:10 minutes (left 8:48, arrive 8:58).\n\nAll correct.\n\nThus, the JSON would look like this:",
            "is_correct": false,
            "count": "meeting_planning_example_974"
        }
