            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule as many meetings as possible with friends in San Francisco, considering travel times and the constraints given. Starting at Mission District at 9:00 AM. Let's list all the people and their availability:\n\n- Laura: Alamo Square, 2:30 PM to 4:15 PM, needs 75 mins.\n- Brian: Presidio, 10:15 AM to 5 PM, 30 mins.\n- Karen: Russian Hill, 6 PM to 8:15 PM, 90 mins.\n- Stephanie: North Beach, 10:15 AM to 4 PM, 75 mins.\n- Helen: Golden Gate Park, 11:30 AM to 9:45 PM, 120 mins.\n- Sandra: Richmond District, 8 AM to 3:15 PM, 30 mins.\n- Mary: Embarcadero, 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM, 120 mins.\n- Deborah: Financial District, 7 PM to 8:45 PM, 105 mins.\n- Elizabeth: Marina District, 8:30 AM to 1:15 PM, 105 mins.\n\nFirst, Elizabeth is only available until 1:15 PM and needs 105 minutes. That's 1 hour 45 mins. Let's check if possible. Starting at 9 AM, after arriving at Mission District. To meet Elizabeth in Marina District, which is 19 mins from Mission District. So leave Mission District at 9:19, arrive at Marina at 9:38? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the travel time from Mission District to Marina District is 19 minutes. So if I leave Mission at 9:00, arrival is 9:19. Then meet Elizabeth from 9:19 to... 105 minutes later is 11:04. But she's available until 1:15 PM. Wait, 105 minutes is 1h45. So if starting at 9:19, ending at 11:04. That fits within her availability (8:30 AM to 1:15 PM). But that would take up the morning. Then after that, what's next? Let's see. Maybe that's possible, but maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps meeting Elizabeth first is necessary because her window ends at 1:15 PM. If I don't meet her in the morning, I can't meet her later. So she requires a 1h45 meeting. So that's a priority. Let's tentatively schedule her from 9:19 to 11:04. But wait, maybe I can start later. Let me check her availability. She's there until 1:15 PM. So if I can meet her later, maybe after meeting others in the morning. But starting at 9:00, let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with Brian at Presidio. His window is 10:15 AM to 5 PM. But he only needs 30 minutes. Maybe easier to fit in. But Elizabeth's longer meeting is critical. If we don't schedule her first, can we fit her in later? Let's see. If we start at 9:00, and go to Marina District (19 mins), arrive at 9:19. Meet Elizabeth from 9:19 to 11:04. Then after that, what's next? Let's look at other friends.\n\nNext, Sandra in Richmond District until 3:15 PM. Needs 30 mins. So after Elizabeth, leaving Marina District at 11:04. Travel time from Marina to Richmond District: Check the table. Marina District to Richmond District is 11 minutes. So leaving at 11:04, arrive at 11:15. Meet Sandra from 11:15 to 11:45. Then from there, where to next? Maybe Helen in Golden Gate Park. From Richmond District to Golden Gate Park is 7 minutes. Arrive at 11:52. Helen's available from 11:30 AM. So start meeting Helen at 11:52. But she needs 2 hours. So from 11:52 to 13:52 (1:52 PM). That's possible. Then after that, need to meet others.\n\nBut wait, there's Stephanie in North Beach until 4 PM, needs 75 mins. Also, Laura at Alamo Square 2:30-4:15 PM, 75 mins. Brian at Presidio until 5 PM, 30 mins. Mary at Embarcadero 4:45-6:45 PM, 120 mins. Karen at Russian Hill 6 PM-8:15 PM, 90 mins. Deborah at Financial District 7-8:45 PM, 105 mins.\n\nSo after Helen, let's see. If Helen ends at 13:52, then next could be Stephanie in North Beach. Travel time from Golden Gate Park to North Beach is 23 minutes. So leave at 13:52, arrive at 14:15 (2:15 PM). Stephanie's available until 4 PM. Need 75 mins (1h15m). So meet from 14:15 to 15:30 (3:30 PM). Then travel to Alamo Square for Laura. From North Beach to Alamo Square is 16 mins (from the table: North Beach to Alamo Square is 16). So leave at 15:30, arrive at 15:46. Laura is available from 14:30 (2:30 PM) to 16:15 (4:15 PM). So meeting Laura from 15:46 to 17:01 (needs 75 mins). But Laura's window ends at 16:15. Oh no, that's a problem. Because 15:46 to 17:01 would end after her availability. So that's not possible. Therefore, this schedule doesn't work.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe meet Laura first after Helen. Let's adjust. After Helen ends at 13:52, travel to Alamo Square. From Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square is 9 minutes. So arrive at 14:01. Laura's available from 14:30. So wait until 14:30 to meet her. But that's 14:01 arrival, but Laura starts at 14:30. So the earliest start is 14:30. Then meet her for 75 mins until 15:45. Then after that, travel to Stephanie in North Beach. Alamo Square to North Beach is 15 mins. So leave at 15:45, arrive at 16:00. But Stephanie is available only until 16:00. So the meeting would have to start at 16:00 and end at 17:15, but Stephanie's not available after 16:00. So that's impossible. So this approach also fails.\n\nAlternatively, after Helen, go to Stephanie first. Let me re-examine. Helen ends at 13:52. From Golden Gate Park to North Beach is 23 mins. Arrive at 14:15. Meet Stephanie from 14:15 to 15:30 (75 mins). Then from there, go to Laura at Alamo Square. North Beach to Alamo Square is 16 mins. Arrive at 15:46. Laura's available until 16:15. So meeting from 15:46 to 17:01. Again, that's beyond Laura's window. So no good.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's see. Maybe not meet Helen for the full 120 minutes. But the user wants to meet as many friends as possible, and Helen's time is available all day. So perhaps cutting Helen short to fit others. But the user specified minimum 120 minutes for Helen. So need to meet her for at least 2 hours.\n\nAlternative idea: Start with Elizabeth in Marina District. Then go to Sandra in Richmond. Then Brian in Presidio, then Helen in Golden Gate Park, then Laura in Alamo Square, then Stephanie in North Beach, then Mary in Embarcadero, Karen in Russian Hill, and Deborah in Financial District.\n\nWait, let's outline:\n\nStart at Mission District 9:00.\n\n9:00 -> leave for Marina District (19 mins), arrive 9:19.\n\nMeet Elizabeth 9:19-11:04 (105 mins).\n\nThen leave for Richmond District (11 mins), arrive 11:15.\n\nMeet Sandra 11:15-11:45 (30 mins).\n\nThen from Richmond District to Presidio (7 mins). Arrive 11:52.\n\nMeet Brian 11:52-12:22 (30 mins). His window is until 5 PM.\n\nThen from Presidio to Golden Gate Park (12 mins). Arrive 12:34.\n\nMeet Helen 12:34-14:34 (120 mins).\n\nThen from Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square (9 mins). Arrive 14:43.\n\nLaura's available from 14:30-16:15. Meet her 14:43-15:58 (75 mins). That ends at 15:58, which is within her window. Then from Alamo Square to North Beach (15 mins). Arrive 16:13. But Stephanie's available until 16:00. So that's too late. So can't meet Stephanie. Alternatively, after Laura, go to another person. Maybe Mary.\n\nWait, Mary is at Embarcadero from 16:45 (4:45 PM) to 18:45 (6:45 PM). Needs 120 mins. So after Laura ends at 15:58, travel to Embarcadero. Alamo Square to Embarcadero is 16 mins. Arrive 16:14. But Mary isn't available until 16:45. So wait until 16:45. Then meet her 16:45-18:45.\n\nThen after that, Karen in Russian Hill 18:00-20:15. So after Mary ends at 18:45, go to Russian Hill. Embarcadero to Russian Hill is 8 mins. Arrive 18:53. Meet Karen 18:53-20:23 (90 mins). But Karen's window ends at 20:15, so adjust to end at 20:15. So start at 18:53, end at 20:15. That's 1h22m, which is less than the 90 required. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, after Mary, go to Karen. But Mary ends at 18:45. Travel time to Russian Hill is 8 mins, arrive 18:53. Karen's window is until 20:15. So meet from 18:53 to 20:23 (90 mins), but that's over. So latest end time is 20:15. So start at 18:53, end at 20:15. That's 82 minutes, which is less than the 90 needed. So Karen's not possible here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after Laura, go to North Beach for Stephanie, but she's only available until 16:00. So no. So maybe not meeting Stephanie. Alternatively, adjust earlier steps to fit Stephanie.\n\nLet's try another approach. Let's see if after meeting Helen, we can meet Stephanie. Helen ends at 14:34. From Golden Gate Park to North Beach is 23 mins. Arrive at 14:57. Stephanie's available until 16:00. So meet from 14:57 to 16:12 (75 mins). That works. Then after Stephanie, go to Laura in Alamo Square. North Beach to Alamo Square is 16 mins. Arrive 16:28. Laura's available until 16:15. So that's too late. Can't meet Laura. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, swap Laura and Stephanie. After Helen ends at 14:34, go to Alamo Square. Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square is 9 mins. Arrive 14:43. Meet Laura 14:43-15:58 (75 mins). Then from Alamo Square to North Beach is 15 mins. Arrive 16:13. Stephanie's window ends at 16:00, so can't meet. So that's no good.\n\nAlternatively, after Helen, meet Brian. Wait, Brian's already met earlier. Hmm. Maybe another path.\n\nAlternative idea: Skip Sandra. Maybe she's only a 30-minute meeting. Let's see. If we can fit her in earlier. After Elizabeth, maybe go to Brian first. Let's see.\n\nElizabeth ends at 11:04. From Marina District to Presidio is 10 mins. So leave at 11:04, arrive at 11:14. Meet Brian from 11:14-11:44 (30 mins). Then from Presidio to Richmond District is 7 mins. Arrive at 11:51. Meet Sandra 11:51-12:21. Then from Richmond to Golden Gate Park (7 mins). Arrive 12:28. Meet Helen 12:28-14:28. Then from there, proceed to Laura.\n\nAfter Helen ends at 14:28, travel to Alamo Square (9 mins). Arrive 14:37. Meet Laura 14:37-15:52. Then from Alamo Square to North Beach (15 mins). Arrive 16:07. Stephanie's window ends at 16:00. Can't meet. So no.\n\nAlternatively, after Helen, go to Stephanie. Golden Gate Park to North Beach is 23 mins. Arrive 14:51. Meet until 16:06. Stephanie's window ends at 16:00. So adjust end to 16:00. That's 14:51-16:00, which is 69 minutes. Not enough for 75. So that's not enough. So Stephanie can't be scheduled here.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to list all possible meetings and see which can fit.\n\nElizabeth (Marina) 9:19-11:04.\n\nThen, possible options:\n\nOption 1: Sandra (Richmond) 11:15-11:45.\n\nThen Brian (Presidio) 11:52-12:22.\n\nThen Helen (Golden Gate Park) 12:34-14:34.\n\nThen Laura (Alamo Square) 14:43-15:58.\n\nThen Mary (Embarcadero) 16:45-18:45.\n\nThen Karen (Russian Hill) 18:53-20:23 (but ends at 20:15, so 18:53-20:15 is 1h22m, insufficient for 90 mins).\n\nThen Deborah (Financial District) 20:15-21:45 (but Deborah's window is 19:00-20:45, so start at 19:00-20:45. But Karen's meeting would have to end by 19:00 to allow time to travel to Financial District. But Karen's window ends at 20:15. So perhaps meet Karen from 18:45 (after Mary) to 20:15 (90 mins). But Mary ends at 18:45. Travel from Embarcadero to Russian Hill is 8 mins. Arrive 18:53. Meet Karen 18:53-20:15 (82 mins). Not enough. So Karen can't be met for 90 mins.\n\nAlternatively, skip Karen and meet Deborah. Mary ends at 18:45. Travel to Financial District (Embarcadero to Financial District is 5 mins (check the table: Embarcadero to Financial District is 5 mins). Arrive 18:50. Deborah's available from 19:00. So start at 19:00. Meet until 20:45 (105 mins). That fits. So Deborah is possible. But Karen would be missed.\n\nSo with this schedule:\n\nElizabeth, Sandra, Brian, Helen, Laura, Mary, Deborah. That's 7 people. But Karen and Stephanie are missed. Is there a way to include Stephanie or Karen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust Helen's time to allow meeting Stephanie. Let's see.\n\nAfter Helen ends at 14:34, go to North Beach. Travel 23 mins, arrive 14:57. Meet Stephanie until 16:12 (75 mins). But Stephanie's window ends at 16:00. So meet from 14:57-16:00 (63 mins). Not enough. So not possible.\n\nAlternatively, meet Stephanie earlier. For example, between Elizabeth and Sandra. Let's see.\n\nElizabeth ends at 11:04. From Marina to North Beach: Marina to North Beach is 11 mins? Wait, Marina District to North Beach travel time is 9 minutes (check the table: Marina District to North Beach is 11 minutes). So leave Marina at 11:04, arrive at 11:15. Meet Stephanie from 11:15-12:30 (75 mins). That works. Then from North Beach to Richmond District (travel time is 17 mins). Arrive at 12:47. Meet Sandra 12:47-13:17. Then from Richmond to Presidio (7 mins) to meet Brian. Arrive 13:24. Meet Brian 13:24-13:54. Then to Golden Gate Park (7 mins). Arrive 14:01. Meet Helen 14:01-16:01. Then from there, to Alamo Square (9 mins). Arrive 16:10. Laura's window ends at 16:15. Meet Laura 16:10-17:25. But Laura is only available until 16:15. So can't do that. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, after Helen, try to meet Laura. But Helen ends at 16:01. Travel to Alamo Square (9 mins). Arrive 16:10. Meet Laura until 16:15 (only 5 mins). Not enough.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Maybe the optimal schedule includes Elizabeth, Sandra, Brian, Helen, Laura, Mary, Deborah. That's 7 people. Karen and Stephanie can't be fit in. Alternatively, is there a way to meet Stephanie instead of Laura?\n\nLet's see. If after Helen ends at 14:34, go to Stephanie in North Beach. 23 mins travel, arrive 14:57. Meet until 16:12 (75 mins). But Stephanie's available until 16:00. So adjust to 14:57-16:00 (63 mins). Not enough. So can't.\n\nAlternatively, meet Stephanie before Laura. For example:\n\nAfter Helen, go to Alamo Square (Laura). Meet Laura 14:43-15:58. Then from there, travel to Embarcadero (16 mins). Arrive 16:14. But Mary isn't available until 16:45. So wait until then. Meet Mary 16:45-18:45. Then Deborah 19:00-20:45. So that's 7 people.\n\nBut what about Brian? He's already met. So in this case, the schedule includes Elizabeth, Sandra, Brian, Helen, Laura, Mary, Deborah. That's 7. Missing Karen and Stephanie.\n\nAlternatively, skip Laura to meet Stephanie. Let's see:\n\nAfter Helen ends at 14:34, go to North Beach (23 mins). Arrive 14:57. Meet Stephanie until 16:12. But her window ends at 16:00. So can't. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach: Start with Brian first.\n\nStart at Mission District 9:00. Travel to Presidio (25 mins). Arrive 9:25. Meet Brian 9:25-9:55. Then from Presidio to Marina District (11 mins). Arrive 10:06. Meet Elizabeth from 10:06-11:51 (105 mins). Then from Marina to Richmond (11 mins). Arrive 12:02. Meet Sandra 12:02-12:32. Then to Golden Gate Park (7 mins). Arrive 12:39. Meet Helen 12:39-14:39. Then to Alamo Square (9 mins). Arrive 14:48. Meet Laura 14:48-16:03. Then to Embarcadero (16 mins). Arrive 16:19. Wait until 16:45. Meet Mary 16:45-18:45. Then to Russian Hill (8 mins). Arrive 18:53. Meet Karen until 20:15 (82 mins). Not enough. Then Deborah from 19:00. So Deborah can't be met.\n\nIn this case, meetings are Brian, Elizabeth, Sandra, Helen, Laura, Mary, Karen (partial), Deborah (if possible). But Karen's meeting is short, Deborah's time overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, after Mary, go to Financial District. Mary ends at 18:45. Embarcadero to Financial District is 5 mins. Arrive 18:50. Deborah's window is 19:00-20:45. Meet her 19:00-20:45 (105 mins). So Deborah is met. But Karen is missed. So total meetings: Brian, Elizabeth, Sandra, Helen, Laura, Mary, Deborah. 7 again.\n\nComparing the two approaches: Starting with Elizabeth first allows meeting 7. Starting with Brian first also allows 7. But which schedule allows more? Maybe same number. But the initial plan where Elizabeth is first allows meeting all except Karen and Stephanie. So perhaps the best possible is 7.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's a way to fit Stephanie in. Let's think. Let's say after meeting Sandra, instead of going to Presidio (Brian), go to Stephanie in North Beach. Let's try:\n\nElizabeth 9:19-11:04. Then from Marina to North Beach. Travel time: Marina to North Beach is 11 mins. Arrive 11:15. Meet Stephanie 11:15-12:30. Then from North Beach to Richmond District (17 mins). Arrive 12:47. Sandra 12:47-13:17. Then to Presidio (7 mins). Arrive 13:24. Meet Brian 13:24-13:54. Then to Golden Gate Park (12 mins). Arrive 14:06. Meet Helen 14:06-16:06. Then to Alamo Square (9 mins). Arrive 16:15. Laura's window ends at 16:15. So meet Laura for 0 minutes. No. Not possible.\n\nSo that doesn't work. Alternatively, after Helen, go to Laura. From Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square (9 mins). Arrive 16:15 (if Helen ends at 16:06). But Laura's window ends at 16:15. So start at 16:15, but need 75 mins. No.\n\nAlternatively, adjust Helen's meeting to end earlier. For example, meet Helen from 12:34-14:34 (as before), then go to Stephanie. But Stephanie's window ends at 16:00.\n\nAlternatively, meet Stephanie after Brian. Let's see:\n\nElizabeth 9:19-11:04. Then to Sandra 11:15-11:45. Then Brian 11:52-12:22. Then from Presidio to North Beach (18 mins). Arrive 12:40. Meet Stephanie 12:40-13:55. Then from North Beach to Golden Gate Park (23 mins). Arrive 14:18. Meet Helen 14:18-16:18. Then to Alamo Square (9 mins). Arrive 16:27. Laura's window ends at 16:15. No good.\n\nHmm. I think this is as far as I can go. The optimal schedule includes Elizabeth, Sandra, Brian, Helen, Laura, Mary, Deborah. That's seven meetings. Let's confirm travel times:\n\nElizabeth: 9:00 departure, arrive Marina 9:19. Meet 9:19-11:04.\n\nThen to Richmond District: 11 mins. Arrive 11:15. Meet Sandra 11:15-11:45.\n\nThen to Presidio: 7 mins. Arrive 11:52. Meet Brian 11:52-12:22.\n\nThen to Golden Gate Park: 12 mins. Arrive 12:34. Meet Helen 12:34-14:34.\n\nThen to Alamo Square: 9 mins. Arrive 14:43. Meet Laura 14:43-15:58.\n\nThen to Embarcadero: Travel from Alamo Square to Embarcadero is 16 mins. So leave at 15:58, arrive 16:14. Mary's window starts at 16:45. Wait until then. Meet Mary 16:45-18:45.\n\nThen to Financial District: Embarcadero to Financial District is 5 mins. Arrive 18:50. Deborah's window is 19:00-20:45. Meet 19:00-20:45 (105 mins). So that works.\n\nThis schedule includes 7 people. Karen and Stephanie are missed, but it's the maximum possible given the constraints.",
