            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this meeting scheduling problem. Hmm, the user is starting at Marina District at 9:00 AM. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible considering travel times and constraints. Let me go through each person's availability and required meeting durations first.\n\nFirst, Laura is at Embarcadero from 7:45 AM to 1:15 PM and needs 105 minutes (1h45m). But the user arrives at Marina at 9:00 AM. The travel time from Marina to Embarcadero is 14 minutes. So earliest arrival at Embarcadero is 9:14 AM. Laura's time ends at 1:15 PM. So possible meeting time: from 9:14 AM to 1:15 PM. But 105 minutes is a big chunk. Let's see: if we start at 9:14 AM, the meeting would end at 11:00 AM (since 9:14 + 1h45m = 10:59 AM). Wait, but Laura is available until 1:15 PM. Maybe that's possible. Wait, but after meeting Laura, the user needs to go to others. Let's check the next person.\n\nCharles is at Bayview from 11:30 AM to 2:30 PM, requires 45 minutes. So maybe after Laura, go to Bayview. But travel time from Embarcadero to Bayview is 19 minutes. If Laura's meeting ends at 11:00 AM, travel would take until 11:19 AM. But Charles starts at 11:30 AM. So that's possible. Meet Charles from 11:30 AM to 12:15 PM (45 mins). Then after that, next person.\n\nMargaret is at Chinatown from 2:15 PM to 7:45 PM, needs 120 minutes. That's a long time. But maybe fit her in after Charles. From Bayview to Chinatown is 19 minutes. So leaving Bayview at 12:15 PM, arrive Chinatown at 12:34 PM. But Margaret is available starting 2:15 PM. Wait, that's a conflict. So maybe need to schedule Margaret later. Alternatively, maybe there's someone else between Charles and Margaret. Let's see.\n\nMelissa is at Russian Hill from 1:00 PM to 7:45 PM, needs 30 minutes. So after Charles, maybe go to Russian Hill. From Bayview to Russian Hill is 23 minutes. Leaving at 12:15 PM, arrive 12:38 PM. But Melissa starts at 1:00 PM. So perhaps wait until 1:00 PM. But then meeting Melissa from 1:00 to 1:30 PM. Then travel time to next location.\n\nThen Patricia is at Haight-Ashbury from 2:30 PM to 8:30 PM, 45 mins. Mark at North Beach 2:00 PM to 6:30 PM, 105 mins. Rebecca at Nob Hill 4:15 PM to 8:30 PM, 90 mins. Robert at Sunset District 4:45 PM to 9:00 PM, 30 mins. Karen at Richmond District 7:15 PM to 9:30 PM, 60 mins.\n\nWait, Laura requires 105 minutes. Let's re-examine Laura's slot. Starting at 9:14 AM, meeting until 11:00 AM (105 minutes). Then travel to Bayview (19 mins) arriving at 11:19 AM. Charles starts at 11:30 AM, so wait 11 minutes. Then meet Charles from 11:30 AM to 12:15 PM. Then from Bayview to Russian Hill (23 mins) arriving 12:38 PM. Melissa is available at 1:00 PM. Maybe wait until 1:00 PM, meet until 1:30 PM. Then next?\n\nFrom Russian Hill to Chinatown is 7 mins. Margaret needs 2 hours. But she's available from 2:15 PM. So if after Melissa, go to Chinatown, arriving at 1:37 PM. But Margaret's not available until 2:15 PM. So maybe schedule Margaret from 2:15 PM to 4:15 PM (120 mins). Then after that, go to Mark at North Beach. From Chinatown to North Beach is 3 mins. Mark is available until 6:30 PM. But he needs 105 minutes (1h45m). If starting at 4:15 PM (after Margaret), meet Mark until 6:00 PM. Then travel to Rebecca at Nob Hill. From North Beach to Nob Hill is 7 minutes (travel time from North Beach to Nob Hill is 7 mins? Wait looking at the travel times: North Beach to Nob Hill is 7 minutes? Let me check. Looking at the data: Nob Hill to North Beach is 8 mins, but North Beach to Nob Hill is 7 mins (from North Beach's row, Nob Hill is 7 mins). So arrival at 6:07 PM. Rebecca is available until 8:30 PM. She needs 90 minutes. So from 6:07 PM to 7:37 PM. But then after that, need to meet Karen at Richmond District from 7:15 PM. Wait, Karen's time starts at 7:15 PM. If Rebecca's meeting ends at 7:37 PM, travel from Nob Hill to Richmond District takes 14 mins (from Nob Hill's row to Richmond District: 14 mins). Arrive at 7:51 PM. Karen is available until 9:30 PM. Need to meet her for 60 mins. So 7:51 PM to 8:51 PM. That works. Then, Robert at Sunset District from 4:45 PM to 9 PM. But how to fit him in? Because after Rebecca, it's already 7:37 PM. Then Karen until 8:51 PM. Then travel to Sunset District: from Richmond District to Sunset District is 11 mins. Arrive at 9:02 PM. But Robert is available until 9 PM. So not possible. Hmm, perhaps this schedule misses Robert.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the order. Let's see. Let me check again. After meeting Margaret in Chinatown from 2:15 PM to 4:15 PM, then perhaps go to Mark at North Beach. From Chinatown to North Beach is 3 mins, arriving at 4:18 PM. Mark needs 105 minutes. So 4:18 PM to 6:03 PM. Then travel to Rebecca at Nob Hill (7 mins), arriving 6:10 PM. Rebecca's available until 8:30 PM. Meet her from 6:10 PM to 7:40 PM (90 mins). Then travel to Karen's location: Nob Hill to Richmond District is 14 mins. Arrive at 7:54 PM. Meet Karen from 7:54 PM to 8:54 PM. Then after that, try to go to Robert at Sunset District. From Richmond District to Sunset District is 11 mins, arriving at 9:05 PM. But Robert is available until 9 PM. So that's too late. So Robert can't be scheduled here. Alternatively, maybe fit Robert in earlier.\n\nWait, what about after meeting Mark at North Beach until 6:03 PM, then go to Robert at Sunset District. From North Beach to Sunset District is 28 mins. Arrive at 6:31 PM. Robert is available until 9 PM. Need 30 mins. So meet from 6:31 PM to 7:01 PM. Then travel to Rebecca's Nob Hill. From Sunset to Nob Hill is 24 mins? Wait, looking at Sunset District's row: Sunset District to Nob Hill is 27 mins. So travel time from Sunset to Nob Hill is 27 mins. Arrive at 7:28 PM. Then meet Rebecca from 7:28 PM to 8:58 PM (90 mins). But Rebecca's available until 8:30 PM. So that's a problem. So end time would be 8:58 PM, but Rebecca's window ends at 8:30 PM. So that's not possible. Hmm. So maybe that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: After Mark, go to Rebecca first. Let's see: Mark ends at 6:03 PM, travel to Nob Hill (7 mins) arrive 6:10 PM. Meet Rebecca from 6:10 PM to 7:40 PM. Then from Nob Hill to Robert at Sunset District: Nob Hill to Sunset District is 24 mins (from Nob Hill's row). So travel time 24 mins, arrive at 7:40 +24=8:04 PM. Robert is available until 9 PM. Meet from 8:04 PM to 8:34 PM (30 mins). Then travel to Karen's Richmond District. Sunset to Richmond District is 12 mins. Arrive 8:46 PM. Karen is available until 9:30 PM. Meet from 8:46 PM to 9:46 PM, but Karen's window ends at 9:30 PM. So that's 8:46 to 9:30 (44 mins), which is less than the required 60. So that's not enough. So Karen can't be fit in that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Robert first. Let's see. After Margaret (4:15 PM), instead of going to Mark, go to Robert. From Chinatown to Sunset District is 30 mins. Arrive at 4:45 PM. Robert is available from 4:45 PM. Meet him from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM. Then travel to Mark at North Beach. Sunset to North Beach is 28 mins. Arrive at 5:43 PM. Mark's available until 6:30 PM. Need 105 mins (1h45m). But from 5:43 PM to 6:30 PM is 47 mins, which isn't enough. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, after Margaret, go to Mark first. From Chinatown to North Beach is 3 mins. Arrive 4:18 PM. Mark is available until 6:30 PM. Meet him from 4:18 PM to 6:03 PM (105 mins). Then go to Rebecca at Nob Hill (7 mins, arrive 6:10 PM). Meet until 7:40 PM. Then travel to Karen (14 mins to Richmond District, arrive 7:54 PM. Meet until 8:54 PM (60 mins). Then try Robert. From Richmond to Sunset is 11 mins. Arrive 9:05 PM. Too late.\n\nBut Robert's window is until 9 PM. So no.\n\nSo maybe we have to drop Robert. Alternatively, find another spot.\n\nAnother angle: Laura's meeting is from 9:14 AM to 11:00 AM. Then Charles from 11:30 AM to 12:15 PM. Then Melissa from 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM. Then Margaret from 2:15 PM to 4:15 PM. Then Patricia? Patricia is at Haight-Ashbury from 2:30 PM. Wait, Margaret's meeting ends at 4:15 PM. So after that, maybe go to Patricia. From Chinatown to Haight-Ashbury is 19 mins. Arrive 4:34 PM. Meet until 5:19 PM (45 mins). Then go to Rebecca. Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill is 13 mins (from Haight-Ashbury's row to Nob Hill is 15 mins? Wait, the data says Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill is 15 minutes. So arrival at 5:34 PM +15 =5:49 PM. Rebecca's available until 8:30 PM. Meet from 5:49 PM to 7:19 PM (90 mins). Then go to Mark. Nob Hill to North Beach is 8 mins. Arrive 7:27 PM. Mark's available until 6:30 PM. Oh, no, that's too late. So Mark's window is until 6:30 PM. So that's not possible. So Mark can't be scheduled here. So this approach is worse.\n\nAlternatively, after Margaret's meeting (ends 4:15 PM), go to Mark at North Beach. Arrive 4:18 PM. Meet until 6:03 PM. Then to Rebecca until 7:33 PM. Then to Karen until 8:33 PM. Then Robert is not possible. So in this case, Mark and Karen are included, Robert not.\n\nSo in this scenario, the schedule includes Laura, Charles, Melissa, Margaret, Mark, Rebecca, Karen. That's 7 people. But Patricia and Robert are left out. Let's see if there's a way to include Patricia.\n\nAlternative: After Melissa (ends 1:30 PM), next go to Patricia at Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 mins. Arrive 1:47 PM. Patricia is available from 2:30 PM. So can't meet until then. So wait until 2:30 PM. Meet until 3:15 PM. Then travel to Margaret's Chinatown (19 mins from Haight-Ashbury to Chinatown). Arrive 3:34 PM. Margaret's available from 2:15 PM. So meet from 3:34 PM to 5:34 PM (120 mins). Then go to Mark at North Beach. 3 mins travel. Arrive 5:37 PM. Mark is available until 6:30 PM. Need 105 mins (until 7:12 PM). But Mark's window ends at 6:30 PM. So can only meet from 5:37 PM to 6:30 PM (53 mins), which is insufficient. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, after Patricia, go to Margaret. But the timing is tight. Let's see. If meet Patricia from 2:30 PM to 3:15 PM, then travel to Chinatown (19 mins) arrive 3:34 PM. Margaret's meeting until 5:34 PM. Then from there to Mark (3 mins) arrive 5:37 PM. Meet until 6:30 PM (53 mins). Then go to Rebecca. From North Beach to Nob Hill (7 mins) arrive 6:37 PM. Meet until 8:07 PM (90 mins). Then to Karen (14 mins) arrive 8:21 PM. Meet until 9:21 PM. Then Robert? From Richmond to Sunset is 11 mins, arrive 9:32 PM. Robert's window ends at 9 PM. Not possible. So this includes Patricia but misses Mark's required time.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the best is to include as many as possible with maximum required durations. Let's re-examine the initial plan:\n\nLaura: 9:14 AM - 11:00 AM (105 mins)\nCharles: 11:30 AM - 12:15 PM (45)\nMelissa: 1:00 PM - 1:30 PM (30)\nMargaret: 2:15 PM -4:15 PM (120)\nMark: 4:18 PM -6:03 PM (105)\nRebecca: 6:10 PM -7:40 PM (90)\nKaren:7:54 PM -8:54 PM (60)\nTotal people: Laura, Charles, Melissa, Margaret, Mark, Rebecca, Karen (7 people). Patricia and Robert are missed. But what about Patricia?\n\nIs there a way to fit Patricia in between some other meetings? For example, after Melissa (1:30 PM), can we go to Patricia? Let's check. From Russian Hill to Haight-Ashbury is 17 mins. Arrive 1:47 PM. Patricia is available from 2:30 PM. So need to wait until 2:30 PM. Meet until 3:15 PM (45 mins). Then travel to Margaret's Chinatown (19 mins), arrive 3:34 PM. Then Margaret's meeting from 3:34 PM to 5:34 PM (120 mins). Then to Mark at North Beach (3 mins) arrive 5:37 PM. Meet until 6:30 PM (53 mins, which is less than required 105). So this won't work. But if we can't meet Mark for the required time, maybe skip Mark and go to someone else.\n\nAlternatively, after Margaret, instead of Mark, meet Rebecca. From Chinatown to Nob Hill is 6 mins. Arrive 4:21 PM. Meet Rebecca from 4:21 PM to 5:51 PM (90 mins). Then go to Mark. Nob Hill to North Beach is 7 mins. Arrive 5:58 PM. Meet until 7:03 PM (105 mins). But Mark's available until 6:30 PM. So only 32 minutes. Not enough. So no. \n\nAlternatively, after Rebecca (ends 5:51 PM), go to Mark. Nob Hill to North Beach is 7 mins. Arrive 5:58 PM. Meet until 6:30 PM (32 mins). Not enough. So Mark's required 105 can't be met here.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial plan is the best, including 7 people. But wait, what about Patricia? Her required time is 45 mins. Is there any way to fit her in?\n\nAfter Margaret's meeting ends at 4:15 PM, perhaps go to Patricia. From Chinatown to Haight-Ashbury is 19 mins. Arrive 4:34 PM. Meet until 5:19 PM (45 mins). Then go to Rebecca at Nob Hill (15 mins from Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill). Arrive 5:34 PM. Meet until 7:04 PM (90 mins). Then Karen from 7:04 PM +14 mins (to Richmond) arrive 7:18 PM. Meet until 8:18 PM (60 mins). Then Robert: Richmond to Sunset District is 11 mins. Arrive 8:29 PM. Meet until 8:59 PM (30 mins). Robert's available until 9 PM. That works! So in this case, the itinerary would be:\n\nLaura (9:14-11:00), Charles (11:30-12:15), Melissa (1:00-1:30), Margaret (2:15-4:15), Patricia (4:34-5:19), Rebecca (5:34-7:04), Karen (7:18-8:18), Robert (8:29-8:59). But wait, let's check the travel times between each:\n\nAfter Laura, travel to Charles: 27 mins (Marina to Bayview is 27, but Laura is at Embarcadero. Wait, wait, initial mistake here. Laura is at Embarcadero, so after meeting Laura, the user is at Embarcadero. Then travel to Bayview (Embarcadero to Bayview is 19 mins? Let's check the travel times. From Embarcadero to Bayview: according to the data, Embarcadero to Bayview is 21 minutes. So Laura's meeting ends at 11:00 AM. Travel from Embarcadero to Bayview takes 21 mins, arriving at 11:21 AM. Charles is available from 11:30 AM, so possible. Then meet Charles 11:30-12:15. Then from Bayview to Russian Hill (23 mins). Arrive 12:38 PM. Melissa is available from 1:00 PM. So wait until 1:00 PM, meet until 1:30 PM. Then from Russian Hill to Chinatown (7 mins, according to Russian Hill to Chinatown is 9 mins. Wait data: Russian Hill to Chinatown is 9 mins. So arrival at 1:39 PM. Margaret is available from 2:15 PM. So need to wait until 2:15 PM. So from 2:15 to 4:15 PM. Then from Chinatown to Haight-Ashbury: 19 mins (Chinatown to Haight-Ashbury is 19). Arrive 4:34 PM. Meet Patricia until 5:19 PM. Then from Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill: 15 mins. Arrive 5:34 PM. Meet Rebecca until 7:04 PM. Then Nob Hill to Richmond District is 14 mins. Arrive 7:18 PM. Meet Karen until 8:18 PM. Then Richmond to Sunset District is 11 mins. Arrive 8:29 PM. Meet Robert until 8:59 PM. All within their time windows.\n\nThis way, we meet Laura, Charles, Melissa, Margaret, Patricia, Rebecca, Karen, Robert. That's 8 people. Only Mark is missed. But Mark requires 105 minutes, which is a big chunk, but in this plan, we're meeting 8 people instead of 7. Let's check if Mark can be included.\n\nWait, Mark is available until 6:30 PM. After Patricia's meeting ends at 5:19 PM, can we go to Mark? From Haight-Ashbury to North Beach is 19 mins. Arrive 5:38 PM. Mark is available until 6:30 PM. Need 105 mins (until 7:23 PM). But Mark's window ends at 6:30 PM. So only 52 minutes available. Not enough. So can't meet Mark here. Alternatively, after Rebecca (ends 7:04 PM), but Mark's window ends at 6:30 PM. So no.\n\nSo the itinerary with 8 people is possible. Let's verify the timeline:\n\n1. Laura: 9:14 AM - 11:00 AM (Embarcadero)\n2. Travel to Bayview: 21 mins, arrives 11:21 AM.\n3. Charles: 11:30 AM - 12:15 PM (Bayview)\n4. Travel to Russian Hill: 23 mins, arrives 12:38 PM.\n5. Melissa: 1:00 PM -1:30 PM (Russian Hill)\n6. Travel to Chinatown: 9 mins, arrives 1:39 PM. Wait until 2:15 PM.\n7. Margaret: 2:15 PM -4:15 PM (Chinatown)\n8. Travel to Haight-Ashbury:19 mins, arrives 4:34 PM.\n9. Patricia:4:34 PM -5:19 PM (Haight-Ashbury)\n10. Travel to Nob Hill:15 mins, arrives 5:34 PM.\n11. Rebecca:5:34 PM -7:04 PM (Nob Hill)\n12. Travel to Richmond District:14 mins, arrives 7:18 PM.\n13. Karen:7:18 PM -8:18 PM (Richmond)\n14. Travel to Sunset District:11 mins, arrives 8:29 PM.\n15. Robert:8:29 PM -8:59 PM (Sunset)\n\nThis fits all their time windows. Now check the travel times:\n\nBetween Laura and Charles: 21 mins (correct).\nCharles to Russian Hill: 23 mins (Bayview to Russian Hill).\nRussian Hill to Chinatown:9 mins.\nChinatown to Haight-Ashbury:19 mins.\nHaight-Ashbury to Nob Hill:15 mins.\nNob Hill to Richmond District:14 mins.\nRichmond to Sunset:11 mins.\n\nAll travel times are accounted for. So this schedule meets 8 people. The only one missed is Mark, who requires 105 mins but can't fit. So this seems optimal.",
