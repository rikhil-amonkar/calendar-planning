            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The user wants to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and constraints. Let's start by listing all the people and their availability along with the required meeting durations.\n\nFirst, the user arrives at Union Square at 9:00 AM. Let's look at each person's time windows and required meeting times.\n\n1. **Kevin** at Mission District: 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM (needs 60 mins). But since the user starts at 9 AM, maybe Kevin is last.\n2. **Mark** at Fisherman's Wharf: 5:15 PM to 8 PM (needs 90 mins). That's a big chunk.\n3. **Jessica** at Russian Hill: 9 AM to 3 PM (needs 120 mins). Since Jessica's available all morning and early afternoon, maybe start with her?\n4. **Jason** at Marina District: 3:15 PM to 9:45 PM (needs 120 mins). Could fit after Jessica.\n5. **John** at North Beach: 9:45 AM to 6 PM (needs 15 mins). Short meeting, flexible time.\n6. **Karen** at Chinatown: 4:45 PM to 7 PM (75 mins). Needs a longer slot.\n7. **Sarah** at Pacific Heights: 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM (45 mins). Tight window.\n8. **Amanda** at The Castro: 8 PM to 9:15 PM (60 mins). Late evening.\n9. **Nancy** at Nob Hill: 9:45 AM to 1 PM (45 mins). Morning to early afternoon.\n10. **Rebecca** at Sunset District: 8:45 AM to 3 PM (75 mins). Starts early but user is at Union Square from 9 AM.\n\nConstraints: User starts at Union Square at 9 AM. Let's see the travel times between locations.\n\nFirst, Rebecca is in Sunset District from 8:45 AM to 3 PM. The user arrives at Union Square at 9 AM. The travel time from Union Square to Sunset District is 27 mins. So leaving at 9 AM would arrive at 9:27 AM. But Rebecca's available until 3 PM. The required meeting is 75 mins. So possible slot: 9:27 AM to 10:42 AM. But would that conflict with others? Let's see.\n\nBut Jessica is in Russian Hill from 9 AM to 3 PM, needs 120 mins. If the user goes to Rebecca first, then Jessica's meeting might have to start later. Let's check travel times. From Sunset District to Russian Hill is 24 mins? Wait, the travel times are listed from Sunset District to other places. Let's check: Sunset District to Russian Hill is 24 mins. So if Rebecca's meeting ends at 10:42 AM, then leaving Sunset District at 10:42, arriving Russian Hill at 11:06 AM. Then meet Jessica from 11:06 AM to 1:06 PM (120 mins). But Jessica is available until 3 PM. That works. But is there a way to meet Jessica earlier?\n\nAlternatively, starting with Jessica. User is at Union Square at 9 AM. Travel time to Russian Hill is 13 mins (from Union Square to Russian Hill). So arrive at 9:13 AM. Meet Jessica from 9:13 to 11:13 AM. Then, after that, perhaps go to Nancy at Nob Hill. Let's check Nancy's availability: 9:45 AM to 1 PM. Nancy's location is Nob Hill. Travel time from Russian Hill to Nob Hill is 5 mins (Russian Hill to Nob Hill). So leaving Russian Hill at 11:13, arrive Nob Hill at 11:18 AM. Meet Nancy for 45 mins, ending at 12:03 PM. Then maybe go to Rebecca? But Rebecca's in Sunset District, which is 24 mins from Nob Hill. Wait, Nob Hill to Sunset District is 24 mins. Leaving at 12:03 PM, arrive at 12:27 PM. Rebecca's available until 3 PM. So meeting from 12:27 PM to 1:42 PM (75 mins). Then after that, maybe Jason at Marina District. Jason's available from 3:15 PM. Wait, but after Rebecca, the time is 1:42 PM. Then go to Marina District. Let's check the travel time from Sunset District to Marina District: 21 mins (Sunset to Marina District). So leaving at 1:42 PM, arrive at 2:03 PM. But Jason is available from 3:15 PM. So there's a gap here. Alternatively, after meeting Nancy, maybe do something else.\n\nAlternatively, after Jessica, meet John at North Beach. John's available from 9:45 AM to 6 PM. Let's see: after Jessica ends at 11:13 AM, travel from Russian Hill to North Beach. Travel time is 5 mins (Russian Hill to North Beach). Arrive at 11:18 AM. Meet John for 15 mins (11:18-11:33 AM). Then go to Nancy at Nob Hill. From North Beach to Nob Hill is 7 mins (North Beach to Nob Hill: 7 mins). Arrive at 11:40 AM. Meet Nancy from 11:40 to 12:25 PM (45 mins). Then from Nob Hill, perhaps go to Rebecca? Nob Hill to Sunset District is 24 mins. Leaving at 12:25 PM, arrive at 12:49 PM. Meet Rebecca from 12:49 PM to 2:04 PM (75 mins). Then, after that, go to Jason at Marina District. But Jason's available from 3:15 PM. So from Sunset District to Marina District is 21 mins. Leaving at 2:04 PM, arrive at 2:25 PM. But Jason isn't available until 3:15 PM. So wait time. Alternatively, after Rebecca, maybe do something else. Maybe go to Karen in Chinatown (available 4:45 PM to 7 PM, 75 mins). But Karen's slot is later. Let's see the timeline so far:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Start at Union Square\n- 9:13-11:13: Jessica (Russian Hill)\n- 11:18-11:33: John (North Beach)\n- 11:40-12:25: Nancy (Nob Hill)\n- 12:49-2:04: Rebecca (Sunset District)\n- Then, from Sunset District to Marina District: 21 mins. Arrive at 2:25 PM. But Jason is available from 3:15 PM. So wait until 3:15 PM. Then meet Jason from 3:15 PM to 5:15 PM (120 mins). Then after that, go to Karen in Chinatown. Marina District to Chinatown is 15 mins. Arrive at 5:30 PM. Karen's available from 4:45 PM to 7 PM. Need 75 mins. So 5:30 PM to 6:45 PM. Then, after Karen, go to Sarah at Pacific Heights. Chinatown to Pacific Heights is 10 mins. Arrive at 6:55 PM. Sarah's available 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. Oops, that's too late. So Sarah's window is only until 6:15 PM. So this doesn't work. So Sarah's slot is conflicting here.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see if we can fit Sarah in after Jason. Jason ends at 5:15 PM. Then travel from Marina District to Pacific Heights: 6 mins. Arrive at 5:21 PM. Sarah's available until 6:15 PM. Need 45 mins. So meet from 5:21 to 6:06 PM. That works. Then after that, go to Karen in Chinatown. Pacific Heights to Chinatown is 11 mins. Arrive at 6:17 PM. Karen needs 75 mins, so from 6:17 PM to 7:32 PM. But Karen is available until 7 PM. So that's not possible. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe adjust the order.\n\nAlternatively, after Jason (ends 5:15 PM), go to Karen first. From Marina District to Chinatown is 15 mins. Arrive at 5:30 PM. Karen's available until 7 PM. Meet from 5:30 PM to 6:45 PM (75 mins). Then go to Sarah at Pacific Heights. Chinatown to Pacific Heights is 11 mins. Arrive at 6:56 PM. But Sarah's window is until 6:15 PM. So that's too late. So Sarah's slot is missed here. So perhaps we need to fit Sarah in between Jason and Karen.\n\nWait, Jason ends at 5:15 PM. Sarah is available from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. So from Marina District to Pacific Heights is 6 mins. So leave at 5:15 PM, arrive 5:21 PM. Meet Sarah from 5:30 PM (when she's available) to 6:15 PM (45 mins). Wait, but Sarah's available starting at 5:30 PM, so the meeting would start at 5:30 PM. So arrival at 5:21 PM, wait until 5:30 PM. Then meet until 6:15 PM. Then travel to Chinatown (11 mins) arrives at 6:26 PM. Karen is available until 7 PM. So meet from 6:26 PM to 7:41 PM (75 mins), but Karen's window ends at 7 PM. So that's not feasible. So Karen can only meet until 7 PM. So 6:26 PM to 7 PM is 34 mins, which is less than the required 75. Not enough. So perhaps Sarah's meeting can't happen if we meet Karen. Hmm. So maybe we have to choose between Karen and Sarah.\n\nAlternatively, after Jason (ends 5:15 PM), go to Mark at Fisherman's Wharf. Marina District to Fisherman's Wharf is 10 mins (Marina District to Fisherman's Wharf). Arrive at 5:25 PM. Mark is available until 8 PM. Need 90 mins. So meet from 5:25 PM to 6:55 PM. Then, after that, go to Sarah. Fisherman's Wharf to Pacific Heights is 12 mins. Arrive at 7:07 PM. Sarah's window is until 6:15 PM. So that's too late. So Sarah can't be met. Alternatively, if we go to Sarah first after Jason. Let's see: Jason ends at 5:15 PM. Travel to Pacific Heights (6 mins), arrive 5:21 PM. Sarah's available 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. So start at 5:30 PM, meet until 6:15 PM (45 mins). Then go to Mark at Fisherman's Wharf. Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf is 13 mins. Arrive 6:28 PM. Mark's available until 8 PM. Meet from 6:28 PM to 8:00 PM (92 mins, which is over the required 90). So that works. But Karen's meeting is missed. Alternatively, after Sarah, go to Karen. From Fisherman's Wharf, after meeting Mark, to Karen in Chinatown. But if Mark's meeting ends at 8 PM, Karen's available until 7 PM. So that's too late. So Karen can't be met in this case. So perhaps it's a trade-off between Mark and Karen.\n\nAlternatively, after Jason, meet Mark first. From Marina District to Fisherman's Wharf is 10 mins. Arrive at 5:25 PM. Meet Mark from 5:25 PM to 6:55 PM (90 mins). Then go to Karen at Chinatown. Fisherman's Wharf to Chinatown is 12 mins. Arrive at 7:07 PM. But Karen is available until 7 PM. So no good. Alternatively, after Jason, meet Karen first. From Marina District to Chinatown is 15 mins. Arrive at 5:30 PM. Meet Karen until 6:45 PM. Then go to Sarah. Chinatown to Pacific Heights is 11 mins. Arrive at 6:56 PM. Sarah's window ends at 6:15 PM. Not possible. So Sarah can't be met here.\n\nAlternatively, after Jason, go to Sarah. Meet Sarah from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. Then go to Mark. Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf is 13 mins. Arrive at 6:28 PM. Meet Mark until 8:00 PM (92 mins). Then after that, Amanda at The Castro. Fisherman's Wharf to The Castro is 27 mins. Arrive at 8:27 PM. Amanda is available until 9:15 PM. Meet from 8:27 PM to 9:27 PM, but Amanda's window ends at 9:15 PM. So meet until 9:15 PM (48 mins), which is less than the required 60. Not enough. Alternatively, adjust Amanda's meeting.\n\nWait, Amanda is at The Castro from 8 PM to 9:15 PM. Need 60 mins. If we arrive at 8 PM, meet until 9 PM. But let's see. If after Mark's meeting ends at 8:00 PM, travel to The Castro takes 27 mins (Fisherman's Wharf to The Castro). Arrive at 8:27 PM. Meet Amanda from 8:27 PM to 9:27 PM, but she's only available until 9:15 PM. So meet until 9:15 PM (48 mins). Not enough. So that's a problem. So perhaps Amanda can't be met if we meet Mark. Alternatively, skip Mark and meet Amanda. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after Jason (ends 5:15 PM), go to Karen. Marina District to Chinatown: 15 mins. Arrive 5:30 PM. Meet until 6:45 PM. Then go to Sarah. Chinatown to Pacific Heights: 11 mins. Arrive 6:56 PM. Sarah's window ends at 6:15 PM. So no. So Sarah can't be met. Then after Karen, maybe go to Mark. Chinatown to Fisherman's Wharf is 8 mins. Arrive at 6:53 PM. Meet Mark from 6:53 PM to 8:23 PM (90 mins). But Mark's available until 8 PM. So that's 6:53 PM to 8 PM (67 mins). Not enough. So no. So Mark can't be met in this scenario. Alternatively, meet Mark earlier. Let's think.\n\nOriginal plan after Rebecca:\n\nJason: 3:15 PM to 5:15 PM.\n\nThen go to Sarah (if possible). But Sarah is available from 5:30 PM. So after Jason, go to Sarah: 5:15 PM departure, 6 mins to Pacific Heights. Arrive 5:21 PM. Wait until 5:30 PM, meet until 6:15 PM. Then go to Karen. Pacific Heights to Chinatown: 11 mins. Arrive 6:26 PM. Meet until 7:41 PM, but Karen's available until 7 PM. So meet from 6:26 PM to 7 PM (34 mins). Not enough. So Karen's meeting can't happen. So perhaps Karen has to be skipped.\n\nAlternatively, after Sarah, go to Mark. Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf: 13 mins. Arrive 6:28 PM. Meet until 8 PM (92 mins). Then go to Amanda. Fisherman's Wharf to The Castro: 27 mins. Arrive 8:27 PM. Meet until 9:15 PM (48 mins). Not enough. So Amanda's meeting is not possible here.\n\nAlternatively, after Mark, go to Amanda. Ends at 8 PM. Travel time 27 mins, arrive at 8:27 PM. Meet Amanda until 9:15 PM (48 mins). Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe skip Mark and meet Amanda. Let's see:\n\nAfter Jason (ends 5:15 PM), go to Amanda. From Marina District to The Castro: 22 mins. Arrive 5:37 PM. But Amanda is available from 8 PM. So no. So Amanda can't be met then.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Jason, do other meetings, then go to Amanda later.\n\nBut Amanda's window is 8 PM to 9:15 PM. Let's see. If we can schedule Amanda after other meetings. For example:\n\nAfter meeting Mark until 8 PM, then go to Amanda. But as before, arriving at 8:27 PM, meeting until 9:15 PM. 48 mins. Not enough. Alternatively, leave Mark's meeting earlier to get to Amanda on time.\n\nAlternatively, if we meet Mark from 5:25 PM to 6:55 PM (90 mins), then go to Amanda. Travel time 27 mins. Arrive at 7:22 PM. Amanda's window starts at 8 PM. So wait until 8 PM. Then meet from 8 PM to 9 PM (60 mins). But Amanda is available from 8 PM, so that works. So this way, Amanda's meeting can fit.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate:\n\nJason ends at 5:15 PM. Go to Mark at Fisherman's Wharf (10 mins travel), arrive 5:25 PM. Meet Mark from 5:25 PM to 6:55 PM (90 mins). Then leave at 6:55 PM, travel to The Castro. Fisherman's Wharf to The Castro is 27 mins. Arrive at 7:22 PM. Amanda's available from 8 PM. So wait until 8 PM. Then meet from 8 PM to 9 PM (60 mins). But Amanda's window ends at 9:15 PM. That works. So Amanda is met from 8 PM to 9 PM. Then go to Kevin at Mission District. The Castro to Mission District is 7 mins. Arrive at 9:07 PM. Kevin's available until 9:45 PM. Meet from 9:07 PM to 10:07 PM, but Kevin's window ends at 9:45 PM. So meet until 9:45 PM (38 mins). Not enough. Kevin needs 60 mins. So can't meet Kevin. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the schedule to meet Kevin. Kevin's available from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM. Need 60 mins. So possible from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM. But if we have Amanda's meeting from 8 PM to 9 PM, then travel to Mission District (7 mins), arrive at 9:07 PM. But Kevin's window ends at 9:45 PM. So meeting from 9:07 PM to 9:45 PM is 38 mins. Not enough. So Kevin can't be met in this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, skip Amanda and meet Kevin. Let's see:\n\nAfter Mark's meeting ends at 6:55 PM, go to Mission District. Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District is 22 mins. Arrive at 7:17 PM. Kevin's available from 8:45 PM. So wait until 8:45 PM. Meet until 9:45 PM (60 mins). That works. But Amanda is skipped. So now we have to choose between Amanda and Kevin.\n\nBut the user wants to meet as many as possible. So let's see which meetings can fit.\n\nLet's try to fit as many as possible:\n\nStart with Jessica from 9:13 AM to 11:13 AM.\n\nThen meet John at North Beach: 11:18 AM to 11:33 AM.\n\nThen Nancy at Nob Hill: 11:40 AM to 12:25 PM.\n\nThen Rebecca at Sunset District: 12:49 PM to 2:04 PM.\n\nThen Jason at Marina District: 3:15 PM to 5:15 PM (need to arrive by 3:15 PM. From Sunset District to Marina District is 21 mins. So leave at 2:04 PM, arrive at 2:25 PM. But Jason is available from 3:15 PM. So wait 50 mins. That's a problem. So perhaps adjust the order to avoid waiting.\n\nAlternative approach: After Nancy, go to Jason earlier? Wait, Nancy ends at 12:25 PM. From Nob Hill to Marina District is 11 mins (Nob Hill to Marina District). Arrive 12:36 PM. Jason is available from 3:15 PM. So wait over 2 hours. Not ideal. Alternatively, maybe after Nancy, go to John again? But John is available until 6 PM, but already met him once. Or perhaps include other people.\n\nAlternatively, after Rebecca, go to Jason. But as before, arrival at 2:25 PM, wait until 3:15 PM. That's 50 mins wasted. Not efficient. Maybe use that time for another meeting. But who's available between 2:25 PM and 3:15 PM?\n\nCheck other people's availability:\n\n- John: available until 6 PM.\n\n- Karen: available from 4:45 PM.\n\n- Mark: available from 5:15 PM.\n\n- Sarah: 5:30 PM.\n\n- Amanda: 8 PM.\n\n- Kevin: 8:45 PM.\n\nSo between 2:25 PM and 3:15 PM, maybe no one is available. So perhaps have to wait. Or rearrange the schedule.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nAfter meeting Nancy at Nob Hill (ends 12:25 PM), go to Union Square. Nob Hill to Union Square is 7 mins. Arrive 12:32 PM. Then go to John at North Beach again? John is available until 6 PM. But maybe not necessary. Alternatively, go to Rebecca at Sunset District. From Nob Hill to Sunset District is 24 mins. Arrive at 12:49 PM. Meet Rebecca from 12:49 PM to 2:04 PM. Then go to Jason at Marina District. From Sunset to Marina: 21 mins. Arrive at 2:25 PM. Wait until 3:15 PM. Then meet Jason from 3:15 PM to 5:15 PM. Then after Jason, go to Sarah. Marina to Pacific Heights: 6 mins. Arrive 5:21 PM. Sarah available from 5:30 PM. Meet from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM. Then go to Karen. Pacific Heights to Chinatown: 11 mins. Arrive 6:26 PM. Meet until 7:41 PM, but Karen's available until 7 PM. So meet from 6:26 PM to 7 PM (34 mins). Not enough. So Karen can't be met.\n\nAlternatively, after Sarah, go to Mark. Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf: 13 mins. Arrive 6:28 PM. Meet Mark from 6:28 PM to 8:00 PM (92 mins). Then go to Amanda. Fisherman's Wharf to The Castro: 27 mins. Arrive 8:27 PM. Meet until 9:15 PM (48 mins). Not enough. Then go to Kevin: The Castro to Mission District: 7 mins. Arrive 9:22 PM. Meet until 9:45 PM (23 mins). Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after Mark's meeting (ends 8:00 PM), go to Kevin. Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District: 22 mins. Arrive 8:22 PM. Kevin's available from 8:45 PM. So wait until 8:45 PM. Meet from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM (60 mins). That works. But Amanda would be skipped.\n\nSo in this scenario, we can meet Kevin, but not Amanda. Alternatively, choose between Amanda and Kevin. The user wants to meet as many as possible, so perhaps prioritize Kevin since Amanda's window is shorter, and Kevin's meeting requires 60 mins which fits exactly into his window.\n\nSo the itinerary would include:\n\nJessica (120), John (15), Nancy (45), Rebecca (75), Jason (120), Sarah (45), Mark (90), Kevin (60). That's 8 people. Amanda and Karen are missed.\n\nBut wait, let's count. The required minimums:\n\n- Kevin: 60\n\n- Mark: 90\n\n- Jessica: 120\n\n- Jason: 120\n\n- John: 15\n\n- Karen:75\n\n- Sarah:45\n\n- Amanda:60\n\n- Nancy:45\n\n- Rebecca:75\n\nSo total required meetings would ideally be 10, but obviously not possible.\n\nIn the above plan, 8 people are met. But let's see if we can fit Karen.\n\nAlternative approach: After Jason (ends 5:15 PM), go to Karen at Chinatown. Marina District to Chinatown: 15 mins. Arrive 5:30 PM. Meet until 6:45 PM (75 mins). Then go to Sarah at Pacific Heights. Chinatown to Pacific Heights: 11 mins. Arrive 6:56 PM. Sarah's window ends at 6:15 PM. So no. So Karen can't be met if we meet Sarah.\n\nAlternatively, after Karen, go to Mark. Chinatown to Fisherman's Wharf: 8 mins. Arrive 6:53 PM. Meet until 8:00 PM (67 mins). Not enough. So Mark can't be met. Alternatively, skip Sarah and meet Mark.\n\nSo after Karen, go to Mark. Meet from 6:53 PM to 8:00 PM (67 mins), but Mark needs 90. So not enough. So no.\n\nAlternatively, after Karen, go to Amanda. Chinatown to The Castro: 22 mins. Arrive 7:07 PM. Amanda is available from 8 PM. So wait until 8 PM. Meet from 8 PM to 9 PM (60 mins). Then go to Kevin. The Castro to Mission District: 7 mins. Arrive 9:07 PM. Meet until 9:45 PM (38 mins). Not enough. So this doesn't work.\n\nSo it's a trade-off between Mark and Kevin vs Amanda and Karen.\n\nIf we choose to meet Mark and Kevin, then Amanda and Karen are missed. If we meet Karen and Amanda, then Mark and Kevin are missed.\n\nThe user wants to meet as many friends as possible. Let's count the possible number of meetings in each scenario.\n\nScenario 1: Include Mark and Kevin:\n\nJessica (120), John (15), Nancy (45), Rebecca (75), Jason (120), Sarah (45), Mark (90), Kevin (60). Total 8.\n\nScenario 2: Include Karen and Amanda:\n\nJessica, John, Nancy, Rebecca, Jason, Karen, Amanda. 7. But Sarah might be added if possible.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nAfter Jason ends at 5:15 PM, go to Karen. Marina District to Chinatown: 15 mins. Arrive 5:30 PM. Meet until 6:45 PM. Then go to Amanda. Chinatown to The Castro: 22 mins. Arrive 7:07 PM. Amanda's available from 8 PM. Wait until 8 PM. Meet until 9 PM. Then go to Kevin: The Castro to Mission District:7 mins. Arrive 9:07 PM. Meet until 9:45 PM (38 mins). Not enough. So Kevin is missed. Amanda is met, Karen is met. Total: Jessica, John, Nancy, Rebecca, Jason, Karen, Amanda. 7. But Sarah and Mark are missed. So scenario 1 is better with 8 meetings.\n\nBut wait, can we include both Sarah and Mark?\n\nAfter Jason, meet Sarah (5:30-6:15 PM), then Mark (6:28-8:00 PM). Then Amanda (8:27-9:15 PM, but not enough time). Then Kevin (9:22-9:45 PM, 23 mins). So total meetings: Jessica, John, Nancy, Rebecca, Jason, Sarah, Mark. 7. Amanda and Kevin are missed. Not better.\n\nAlternatively, after Sarah, go to Amanda. Pacific Heights to The Castro:16 mins. Arrive 6:31 PM. Amanda is available from 8 PM. Wait until 8 PM. Meet until 9 PM. Then go to Kevin: 7 mins, meet until 9:45 PM (45 mins). Not enough. So Amanda is met, Kevin is partial.\n\nAlternatively, meet Amanda from 8 PM to 9 PM, then Kevin from 9:07 PM to 9:45 PM (38 mins). So Amanda is met, Kevin partially. Not meeting the required 60 mins.\n\nSo the best scenario seems to be scenario 1 with 8 meetings: Jessica, John, Nancy, Rebecca, Jason, Sarah, Mark, Kevin.\n\nBut wait, can we fit Sarah in?\n\nLet's re-examine:\n\nAfter Jason (5:15 PM), go to Sarah: 6 mins to Pacific Heights. Arrive 5:21 PM. Wait until 5:30 PM. Meet until 6:15 PM. Then go to Mark: Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf (13 mins). Arrive 6:28 PM. Meet until 8:00 PM (92 mins). Then go to Amanda: arrive 8:27 PM, meet until 9:15 PM (48 mins). Then go to Kevin: arrive 9:22 PM, meet until 9:45 PM (23 mins). So Amanda and Kevin are partial. So total meetings: Jessica, John, Nancy, Rebecca, Jason, Sarah, Mark. 7.\n\nBut if we skip Amanda and Kevin, and meet Mark and Sarah, and then go to Kevin:\n\nAfter Mark ends at 8 PM, go to Kevin: 22 mins to Mission District. Arrive 8:22 PM. Kevin's available from 8:45 PM. Wait until 8:45 PM. Meet until 9:45 PM (60 mins). So Kevin is met. Amanda is missed. So meetings: Jessica, John, Nancy, Rebecca, Jason, Sarah, Mark, Kevin. 8.\n\nSo this way, 8 meetings are possible.\n\nThus, the itinerary would be:\n\nStart at Union Square at 9:00 AM.\n\n- 9:13-11:13: Jessica (Russian Hill)\n\n- 11:18-11:33: John (North Beach) [15 mins]\n\n- 11:40-12:25: Nancy (Nob Hill) [45 mins]\n\n- 12:49-2:04: Rebecca (Sunset District) [75 mins]\n\n- Then travel to Marina District: 21 mins. Arrive 2:25 PM. Wait until 3:15 PM.\n\n- 3:15-5:15: Jason (Marina District) [120 mins]\n\n- 5:21-6:15: Sarah (Pacific Heights) [45 mins]\n\n- 6:28-8:00: Mark (Fisherman's Wharf) [92 mins, meets 90]\n\n- 8:22-9:45: Kevin (Mission District) [83 mins, meets 60]\n\nWait, Kevin's meeting needs to start at 8:45 PM. So:\n\nAfter Mark ends at 8:00 PM, travel to Mission District (22 mins). Arrive 8:22 PM. Kevin's available from 8:45 PM. Wait until 8:45 PM. Meet from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM (60 mins). That works.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n[\n  Jessica: 9:13-11:13,\n  John: 11:18-11:33,\n  Nancy: 11:40-12:25,\n  Rebecca: 12:49-14:04,\n  Jason: 15:15-17:15,\n  Sarah: 17:30-18:15,\n  Mark: 18:28-20:00,\n  Kevin: 20:45-21:45\n]\n\nNow check travel times between each meeting:\n\nFrom Union Square to Russian Hill: 13 mins (start at 9:00, arrive 9:13).\n\nRussian Hill to North Beach: 5 mins (11:13 end, travel to North Beach, arrive 11:18).\n\nNorth Beach to Nob Hill:7 mins (11:33 end, travel to Nob Hill, arrive 11:40).\n\nNob Hill to Sunset District:24 mins (12:25 end, leave at 12:25, arrive 12:49).\n\nSunset District to Marina District:21 mins (14:04 end, leave at 14:04, arrive 14:25. Wait until 15:15 for Jason.\n\nMarina District to Pacific Heights:6 mins (17:15 end, leave at 17:15, arrive 17:21. Wait until 17:30).\n\nPacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf:13 mins (18:15 end, leave at 18:15, arrive 18:28).\n\nFisherman's Wharf to Mission District:22 mins (20:00 end, leave at 20:00, arrive 20:22. Wait until 20:45).\n\nAll travel times are accounted for.\n\nNow check if each meeting duration meets the minimum:\n\n- Jessica: 120 mins (correct).\n\n- John: 15 mins (correct).\n\n- Nancy: 45 mins (correct).\n\n- Rebecca: 75 mins (correct).\n\n- Jason: 120 mins (correct).\n\n- Sarah: 45 mins (correct).\n\n- Mark: 92 mins (meets 90 mins requirement).\n\n- Kevin: 60 mins (correct).\n\nSo this itinerary meets all required durations.\n\nBut wait, after Rebecca at Sunset District ends at 14:04, the travel time to Marina District is 21 mins. So arriving at 14:25. But Jason's availability starts at 15:15. So there's a 50-minute wait. Could this time be used for another meeting?\n\nCheck who's available between 14:25 and 15:15:\n\nJohn is available until 18:00. But already met John. Karen is available from 16:45. Others: Mark from 17:15, Sarah from 17:30. So no one else is available during that gap. So the user has to wait.\n\nThus, this schedule seems to be the maximum possible, meeting 8 people.\n\nBut wait, Karen is available from 16:45 to 19:00. Maybe fit her in between Jason and Sarah.\n\nAfter Jason ends at 17:15, travel to Chinatown (15 mins). Arrive 17:30. Meet Karen from 17:30 to 18:45 (75 mins). Then go to Sarah at Pacific Heights. Chinatown to Pacific Heights is 11 mins. Arrive 18:56. Sarah's available until 18:15. Too late. So can't meet Sarah.\n\nAlternatively, meet Sarah first. After Jason ends at 17:15, go to Sarah. 6 mins to Pacific Heights. Arrive 17:21. Meet until 18:06 (45 mins). Then go to Karen. Arrive 18:17. Meet until 19:32, but Karen's available until 19:00. So meet until 19:00 (43 mins). Not enough. So Karen's 75 mins not met.\n\nThus, this would replace Mark and Kevin with Karen and Sarah, but not meeting their full durations. Hence, not better.\n\nTherefore, the initial plan to meet 8 people is the best possible.",
