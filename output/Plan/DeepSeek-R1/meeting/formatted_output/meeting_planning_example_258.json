            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. So, the goal is to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco considering travel times and constraints. The user arrives at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. The friends are Betty at Presidio, David at Richmond District, and Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf, each with their own availability and required meeting durations.\n\nFirst, let's list out the constraints again to make sure I don't miss anything. \n\nBetty is available from 10:15 AM to 9:30 PM, needs a 45-minute meeting. David is available from 1:00 PM to 8:15 PM, requires 90 minutes. Barbara is available from 9:15 AM to 8:15 PM and needs 120 minutes. The user starts at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. \n\nThe travel times between each location are given. Let's see. The first thing is to figure out possible order of meetings. Since Barbara is at Fisherman's Wharf, which is only 6 minutes from Embarcadero. Since the user arrives at 9:00 AM, and Barbara is available from 9:15 AM, maybe starting with Barbara makes sense. But Barbara needs 2 hours. Let's see: if they leave Embarcadero at 9:00, they can get to Fisherman's Wharf by 9:06. But Barbara is available from 9:15, so maybe start meeting at 9:15. Then the meeting would end at 11:15. Then, from Fisherman's Wharf, where to next? Let's see travel times. From Fisherman's Wharf to Presidio is 17 minutes, or to Richmond District is 18. Betty is at Presidio, available from 10:15 AM. But if we meet Barbara first, we might have a conflict because Betty's earliest time is 10:15. Wait, Barbara's meeting would end at 11:15. Then traveling to Presidio would take 17 minutes, arriving at 11:32. Then meeting Betty for 45 minutes would start at 11:32, but need to check if that's within Betty's availability. Betty is available until 9:30 PM, so that's okay. But maybe that's possible. Then after Betty, go to David in Richmond District. From Presidio to Richmond is 7 minutes. Let's say after meeting Betty until 12:17 PM (start 11:32, end 12:17). Then travel to Richmond takes 7 minutes, arriving at 12:24. David is available from 1 PM, so wait until 1 PM. Then meet David for 90 minutes until 2:30 PM. But wait, David's available until 8:15 PM, so that's fine. But the problem is the waiting time between 12:24 and 1 PM. That's 36 minutes of waiting. Alternatively, could we arrange the meetings differently to avoid waiting?\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with Betty first. Let's see. Arrive at Embarcadero at 9 AM. Travel to Presidio takes 20 minutes, arriving at 9:20 AM. But Betty is only available from 10:15 AM. So they would have to wait from 9:20 to 10:15, which is 55 minutes. That's a lot of waiting. Then meet Betty from 10:15 to 11:00 AM (45 minutes). Then travel to another location. From Presidio to Fisherman's Wharf is 19 minutes. Arrive at 11:19. Barbara is available from 9:15 AM. So start meeting Barbara at 11:19, but she needs 120 minutes, so end at 13:19 (1:19 PM). Then after that, travel to Richmond District from Fisherman's Wharf, which takes 18 minutes, arriving at 13:37. David is available from 1 PM, so start meeting at 13:37. Need 90 minutes, so until 15:07 (3:07 PM). That works. So that's three meetings. But wait, Barbara's meeting in this case starts at 11:19 and ends at 1:19 PM. That's 2 hours. But Barbara is available until 8:15 PM, so that's okay. Then David's meeting starts at 1:37 PM (if arrival is 13:37, then start immediately), ends at 3:07 PM. This schedule includes all three friends. That's better than the first approach where only two meetings were possible. Wait, in the first approach, Barbara, then Betty, then David. But in the second approach, Betty, Barbara, David. Let's compare.\n\nFirst approach: Barbara from 9:15 to 11:15 (2 hours). Then travel to Presidio (17 min, arrive 11:32). Betty from 11:32 to 12:17 (45 min). Then travel to Richmond (7 min, arrive 12:24). Wait until 1 PM (36 min), then meet David until 2:30 PM. Then that's three meetings. Wait, that's also three meetings. So which is better?\n\nLet me compare the total time and possible overlaps. Also, check if all time windows are respected.\n\nIn the first scenario:\n\n- Barbara: 9:15-11:15 (OK, within her 9:15-8:15)\n- Betty: 11:32-12:17 (OK, within her 10:15-9:30)\n- David: 1:00-2:30 (since arrival at 12:24, wait until 1 PM, then meet from 1 PM to 2:30 PM. That's 90 minutes. So that works.\n\nBut in this case, the user has to wait 36 minutes for David. But that's acceptable. Alternatively, could we adjust the times to avoid waiting?\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Betty, go to David first. Let's see. After meeting Barbara from 9:15-11:15, travel to Presidio (17 min, arrive 11:32). Meet Betty 11:32-12:17. Then travel to Richmond District. From Presidio to Richmond is 7 minutes, arrive 12:24. David is available from 1 PM. So again, same waiting time. So no difference.\n\nAlternatively, what if after Barbara, go to David first, then Betty? Let's see. Barbara ends at 11:15. Travel to Richmond District from Fisherman's Wharf takes 18 minutes, arrive 11:33. But David is only available from 1 PM. So arrival at 11:33, which is too early. So have to wait until 1 PM. That's 1h27m wait. That's worse. So that's not good. So better to go to Betty first after Barbara.\n\nSo the first approach allows three meetings. The second approach (Betty first) also allows three meetings, but with more waiting time initially. Let's see which is better.\n\nIn the first scenario:\n\n9:00 AM arrive at Embarcadero.\n\nTravel to Fisherman's Wharf: 6 min, arrive 9:06. But Barbara is available from 9:15. So wait from 9:06 to 9:15 (9 minutes). Then meet from 9:15 to 11:15.\n\nThen travel to Presidio (17 min, arrive 11:32). Meet Betty 11:32-12:17 (45 min). Then travel to Richmond (7 min, arrive 12:24). Wait until 1 PM (36 min). Meet David 1 PM-2:30 PM. Then the rest of the day is free. So total meetings: Barbara, Betty, David.\n\nIn the second scenario (Betty first):\n\n9:00 AM arrive at Embarcadero. Travel to Presidio (20 min, arrive 9:20. Wait until 10:15 AM (55 min). Meet Betty 10:15-11:00. Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf (19 min, arrive 11:19. Meet Barbara 11:19-13:19 (2h). Then travel to Richmond (18 min, arrive 13:37. Meet David 13:37-15:07 (90 min). Then done. So three meetings here as well. \n\nWhich schedule is more efficient? The first scenario has two waiting periods (9:06-9:15 and 12:24-1 PM) totaling 45 minutes. The second scenario has a long initial wait (55 min) and then no other waits. But maybe the first scenario is better in terms of less total waiting time.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, total waiting time is 9 + 36 = 45 minutes. In the second scenario, 55 minutes. So the first scenario has less waiting time. So better to go with the first scenario.\n\nBut let's check if Barbara's meeting can be adjusted. For example, maybe meet Betty first, but with a different order. Alternatively, perhaps start with Barbara, then David, then Betty. But can that work?\n\nBarbara from 9:15-11:15. Then travel to Richmond District from Fisherman's Wharf takes 18 minutes (arrive 11:33). But David is available from 1 PM. So wait from 11:33 to 1 PM (1h27m). Then meet David 1 PM-2:30 PM. Then travel to Presidio (from Richmond to Presidio is 7 min, arrive 2:37 PM. Meet Betty from 2:37 PM to 3:22 PM (45 min). That works. So three meetings here as well. But the wait time for David is 1h27m, which is worse than the first approach. So this is not better.\n\nSo the first approach seems better. Let's verify all the times again.\n\nFirst approach:\n\n- Start at Embarcadero at 9:00.\n\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf: 6 minutes. Arrive at 9:06. But Barbara is available from 9:15. So wait until 9:15. Then meet Barbara for 120 minutes until 11:15.\n\n- Then travel to Presidio: 17 minutes. Arrive at 11:32. Meet Betty from 11:32 to 12:17 (45 minutes).\n\n- Then travel to Richmond District: 7 minutes. Arrive at 12:24. David is available from 1 PM. Wait until 1 PM (36 minutes). Meet David from 1 PM to 2:30 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThat's three meetings, with two waiting periods. All constraints are met.\n\nAnother possible scenario: Could we meet David first after Barbara? Let's see. Barbara until 11:15. Travel to Richmond District (18 min, arrive 11:33. Wait until 1 PM, meet David 1-2:30. Then travel to Presidio (18 min from Richmond to Presidio is 7 min? Wait, the travel times from Richmond to Presidio is 7 minutes. So arrival at 2:37. Meet Betty from 2:37-3:22. That's also possible. So same as before. But again, the wait for David is longer. So first approach is better.\n\nIs there a way to avoid waiting for David? Let's think. If after Betty, we can get to David earlier. Let's see. After meeting Betty from 11:32-12:17, travel to Richmond (7 min, arrive 12:24). David's available from 1 PM. So we have to wait until 1 PM. No way around that. Unless we can meet David earlier, but he's not available until 1 PM. So that's fixed. So the wait is unavoidable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet David first after Barbara. But as discussed, that leads to longer wait. So the first scenario is better.\n\nAnother angle: Could we split Barbara's meeting into two parts? Like meet her for part of the time, then go to someone else, then come back? But the problem states \"a minimum of 120 minutes\". So we need to meet her for at least 120 minutes continuously. So splitting isn't allowed.\n\nSame with Betty and David; their meetings must be continuous for the minimum duration.\n\nSo the best schedule is Barbara first, then Betty, then David, with the two waiting periods.\n\nAlternatively, if we can adjust Barbara's meeting time to start later and still fit in the other meetings. Let's see. Suppose we meet Barbara from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Wait, but she's available from 9:15 AM. So that's possible. Let's see:\n\nStart at Embarcadero at 9:00. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (6 min, arrive 9:06). Wait until 10:00 to start meeting Barbara (but why? Maybe to allow meeting Betty earlier? Let's see.\n\nIf we start Barbara at 10:00, end at 12:00. Then travel to Presidio (17 min, arrive 12:17. Meet Betty from 12:17-1:02 PM (45 min). Then travel to Richmond (7 min, arrive 1:09 PM. David is available from 1 PM. So start meeting David at 1:09 PM, but he needs 90 minutes. So end at 2:39 PM. That works. But Barbara's meeting was moved to start at 10:00 instead of 9:15. But why would we do that? Because then, the waiting time for Barbara would be from 9:06 to 10:00 (54 minutes). That's worse than the initial scenario where we only waited 9 minutes. So that's not better. So no, this isn't helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Meet Betty first, then Barbara, then David. Let's recheck that scenario.\n\nArrive at Embarcadero 9:00. Travel to Presidio (20 min, arrive 9:20. Wait until 10:15 (55 min). Meet Betty 10:15-11:00. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (19 min, arrive 11:19. Meet Barbara 11:19-13:19 (2h). Then travel to Richmond (18 min, arrive 13:37. Meet David 13:37-15:07. That's three meetings. The total waiting time here is 55 minutes (initially), but after that, no waiting. Comparing to the first scenario's total waiting time of 45 minutes, this is worse. So the first scenario is better.\n\nTherefore, the optimal schedule is:\n\n1. Meet Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15 to 11:15.\n\n2. Travel to Presidio, meet Betty from 11:32 to 12:17.\n\n3. Travel to Richmond District, meet David from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\nNow, verifying the travel times:\n\n- After Barbara's meeting ends at 11:15, travel to Presidio takes 17 minutes. So departure at 11:15, arrival at 11:32. Then meeting starts immediately.\n\n- After Betty's meeting ends at 12:17, travel to Richmond takes 7 minutes. Arrive at 12:24. David is available from 1 PM, so wait until then. Start at 1 PM, end at 2:30 PM.\n\nYes, this works. All constraints are met. The user meets all three friends, which is the maximum possible. Therefore, this is the best itinerary.",
