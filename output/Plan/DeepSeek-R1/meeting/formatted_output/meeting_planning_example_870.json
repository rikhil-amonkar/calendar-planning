            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. I need to fit as many meetings as possible considering travel times and constraints. Starting at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM.\n\nFirst, Sandra is at Nob Hill from 9:15 AM to 6:30 PM, needs 60 minutes. Travel from Pacific Heights to Nob Hill is 8 minutes. The earliest I can arrive is 9:08 AM, but she's available from 9:15. So start at 9:15, meet until 10:15. Then, Carol is in Financial District from 10:15 AM to 12 PM, needs 60 minutes. Travel time from Nob Hill to Financial District is 9 minutes (Nob Hill to Financial District is 8 per the data, wait, check travel times: Nob Hill to Financial District is 9 minutes? Wait, looking at the travel times: \"Nob Hill to Financial District: 9.\" So leaving Nob Hill at 10:15, takes 9 minutes, arrive at Financial District at 10:24. But Carol is only available until 12 PM. So 10:24 start, but needs 60 minutes. That would end at 11:24. That's possible. But maybe adjust the timing to start earlier. Wait, if I leave Sandra at 10:15, then travel 9 minutes, arrive 10:24. So the meeting with Carol would start at 10:24 and end at 11:24. That's within Carol's window (10:15-12 PM). So Carol's meeting is 10:24-11:24.\n\nNext, Brian is at Presidio from 10 AM to 9:30 PM, needs 75 minutes. After Carol, travel from Financial District to Presidio. Travel time from Financial District to Presidio is 22 minutes. So leaving Carol at 11:24, arrive Presidio at 11:46. Then meet Brian from 11:46 to 1:01 PM (75 mins). That works because Brian's available all day.\n\nThen, Kimberly in Richmond District from 2:15 PM to 10 PM, needs 30 mins. Travel from Presidio to Richmond District is 7 minutes. Leaving Presidio at 1:01 PM, arrive Richmond at 1:08. But Kimberly is available only from 2:15 PM. Hmm, that's a problem. There's a gap between 1:01 PM and 2:15 PM. Maybe I can fit someone else here. Wait, let's check other options. Let's see after Brian: 1:01 PM. What's next? Maybe Laura in Mission District from 4:15 PM to 8:30 PM. But need to check if there's someone else. Kenneth in The Castro from 2:45-4:15 PM. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after Carol, maybe meet Brian later. Let's see. After Carol ends at 11:24, maybe go to Presidio but that's 22 minutes. But maybe instead, after Sandra and Carol, go to Brian. Wait, but Brian is available all day, so perhaps after Carol, go to Brian. Let's confirm. Carol ends at 11:24, travel to Presidio (22 mins) arrives 11:46. Then meet Brian from 11:46 to 1:01 PM (75 mins). Then from 1:01 PM, need to find the next meeting.\n\nBut Kimberly is available from 2:15 PM. So from 1:01 PM to 2:15 PM is 1h14m. Travel time from Presidio to Richmond is 7 mins. So could leave at 2:08 PM to arrive at 2:15 PM. So meet Kimberly from 2:15-2:45 PM. Then next, Kenneth in The Castro from 2:45-4:15 PM. Travel from Richmond to Castro is 16 mins. Leaving Richmond at 2:45, arrive at 2:45 +16=3:01 PM. But Kenneth's window is until 4:15. So meet from 3:01 PM to 3:31 PM (30 mins). Then Laura in Mission District from 4:15 PM. From The Castro to Mission District is 7 mins (Castro to Mission District). Wait, The Castro to Mission District is 7 mins. So after Kenneth ends at 3:31 PM, next would be Laura. But Laura is available from 4:15 PM. So maybe there's a gap here. Let's see: 3:31 PM to 4:15 PM. Could we fit someone else in between? Let's see other options.\n\nWait, after Kimberly (ends 2:45 PM), then go to Kenneth in The Castro (needs 16 mins from Richmond). So arrival at 2:45 +16=3:01 PM. Kenneth is available until 4:15 PM. So meeting from 3:01 to 3:31. Then, after that, maybe go to Laura in Mission District. The Castro to Mission District is 7 mins. So leaving at 3:31 PM, arrive at 3:38 PM. But Laura's available from 4:15 PM. So we have to wait until 4:15 PM. Hmm, that's a problem. So between 3:38 PM and 4:15 PM, there's a gap. Can we adjust?\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Kimberly until 2:45 PM, perhaps go to Laura first. Let's check. From Richmond District to Mission District is 20 mins. So leaving at 2:45 PM, arrive at 3:05 PM. But Laura is available from 4:15 PM. So that's too early. Alternatively, maybe go to another location. Let's check other friends. Linda is at Marina District from 6 PM to 10 PM. Karen at Russian Hill from 6:30 PM. Paul at Alamo Square at 9 PM. So after Kimberly, perhaps meet Kenneth first, then Laura. But after Kenneth ends at 3:31 PM, then we have time until Laura's availability at 4:15 PM. Maybe use that time to travel somewhere else. But perhaps that's unavoidable. Let's proceed.\n\nSo after Kenneth ends at 3:31 PM, then travel to Mission District (7 mins, arriving 3:38 PM). Then wait until 4:15 PM to meet Laura. That's a 37-minute wait. Maybe not ideal, but possible. Then meet Laura from 4:15-4:45 PM (30 mins). Then after that, perhaps go to Linda in Marina District. Travel time from Mission District to Marina is 19 mins. So leaving at 4:45 PM, arrive at 5:04 PM. But Linda is available from 6 PM. So need to wait until 6 PM. That's a gap. Alternatively, after Laura, maybe meet someone else. Let's see: Karen at Russian Hill from 6:30 PM. But that's later. So maybe after Laura, go to Marina to meet Linda. But have to wait until 6 PM. Alternatively, maybe find another meeting between 4:45 PM and 6 PM. Let's see. Are there any other friends available during that time? Sandra was available until 6:30 PM. Wait, Sandra is at Nob Hill until 6:30 PM. Could we meet Sandra again? But the minimum for Sandra is 60 minutes. But we already met her from 9:15-10:15 AM. So no, can't meet her again. Brian is available all day, but already met him. So perhaps no other options. So after Laura, wait until 6 PM to meet Linda. So meet Linda from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM. Then travel to Karen at Russian Hill. From Marina to Russian Hill is 8 mins. So arrive at 6:38 PM. Karen is available from 6:30 PM. So start at 6:38 PM, meet until 7:53 PM (75 mins). Then after that, Paul is at Alamo Square from 9 PM to 9:30 PM. Travel from Russian Hill to Alamo Square is 15 mins. So leave at 8:45 PM (since Karen's meeting ends at 7:53 PM, maybe have some time here). Wait, 7:53 PM to 9 PM is 1h7m. Travel time from Russian Hill to Alamo Square is 15 mins. So leave at 8:45 PM to arrive at 9:00 PM. Meet Paul from 9:00-9:15 PM (15 mins), which satisfies his constraint. Then done.\n\nSo let's check the schedule:\n\n1. Start at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM.\n\nFirst meeting: Sandra at Nob Hill. Travel time 8 mins, arrive 9:08 AM. But she's available from 9:15. Wait until 9:15. Meet from 9:15-10:15 AM.\n\nNext: Carol at Financial District. Travel 9 mins (Nob Hill to Financial District is 9 mins). Depart at 10:15, arrive 10:24. Meet 10:24-11:24 AM.\n\nNext: Brian at Presidio. Travel 22 mins (Financial District to Presidio). Depart 11:24, arrive 11:46. Meet 11:46-13:01 (1:01 PM).\n\nThen Kimberly at Richmond District. Travel 7 mins (Presidio to Richmond). Depart 13:01, arrive 13:08. But Kimberly is available from 14:15 (2:15 PM). So there's a gap here. Wait, that's a problem. Hmm. So from 1:01 PM to 2:15 PM, need to wait. Maybe I can adjust the order here. Maybe after Brian, go somewhere else first. Let's think again.\n\nAfter Brian ends at 1:01 PM, next available is Kimberly at 2:15 PM. So there's a 1h14m gap. Can we use that time for another meeting? Let's check other friends. Let's see:\n\nLaura is available from 4:15 PM. Kenneth from 2:45 PM. Maybe after Brian, go to Kenneth first. Let's see. From Presidio to The Castro is 20 mins (Presidio to The Castro is 21 minutes? Wait, checking the travel times: Presidio to The Castro is 21 minutes. So leaving Presidio at 1:01 PM, arrive at The Castro at 1:22 PM. But Kenneth is available only from 2:45 PM. So that's too early. Can't meet him yet.\n\nAlternatively, go to Alamo Square for Paul, but he's available at 9 PM. So no. How about meeting Sandra again? But she's already been met. So perhaps the gap is unavoidable. Then, proceed to Kimberly at 2:15 PM. So after Brian at 1:01 PM, wait until 2:08 PM to leave Presidio (since travel time is 7 mins, arrive at 2:15 PM). So meet Kimberly from 2:15-2:45 PM.\n\nThen, go to Kenneth in The Castro. Travel time from Richmond to The Castro is 16 mins. Depart at 2:45 PM, arrive at 3:01 PM. Meet 3:01-3:31 PM.\n\nThen go to Laura in Mission District. The Castro to Mission District is 7 mins. Arrive at 3:38 PM. But Laura's available from 4:15 PM. So wait until 4:15 PM. Meet 4:15-4:45 PM.\n\nThen travel to Marina District for Linda. Mission to Marina is 20 mins. Depart 4:45, arrive 5:05 PM. But Linda is available from 6 PM. So wait until 6 PM. Meet 6:00-6:30 PM.\n\nThen go to Karen in Russian Hill. Marina to Russian Hill is 8 mins. Arrive 6:38 PM. Meet 6:38-7:53 PM (75 mins).\n\nThen travel to Alamo Square for Paul. Russian Hill to Alamo Square is 15 mins. Depart 7:53 PM, arrive 8:08 PM. But Paul is available from 9 PM. Wait, that's a 52-minute wait. So wait until 9 PM. Meet 9:00-9:15 PM.\n\nSo that's all meetings except maybe Paul. Let's check if all are included:\n\nSandra, Carol, Brian, Kimberly, Kenneth, Laura, Linda, Karen, Paul. That's 9 people. Wait, the friends listed are Linda, Kenneth, Kimberly, Paul, Carol, Brian, Laura, Sandra, Karen. Total 9. So all are met.\n\nBut let's check the times:\n\n- Sandra: 9:15-10:15 AM (60 mins)\n- Carol: 10:24-11:24 AM (60 mins)\n- Brian: 11:46 AM-1:01 PM (75 mins)\n- Kimberly: 2:15-2:45 PM (30 mins)\n- Kenneth: 3:01-3:31 PM (30 mins)\n- Laura: 4:15-4:45 PM (30 mins)\n- Linda: 6:00-6:30 PM (30 mins)\n- Karen: 6:38-7:53 PM (75 mins)\n- Paul: 9:00-9:15 PM (15 mins)\n\nThat's all nine friends. Now check if travel times are accounted for between each meeting.\n\nFrom Sandra to Carol: Nob Hill to Financial District is 9 mins. Depart 10:15, arrive 10:24. Correct.\n\nCarol to Brian: Financial District to Presidio 22 mins. Depart 11:24, arrive 11:46. Correct.\n\nBrian to Kimberly: Presidio to Richmond District 7 mins. Depart 1:01 PM, arrive 1:08 PM.
