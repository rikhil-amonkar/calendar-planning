            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, the user is starting at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM and needs to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and the constraints each person has. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the friends and their availability:\n\n- Sarah: Fisherman's Wharf, 2:45 PM to 5:30 PM, needs 105 minutes (1h45m).\n- Mary: Richmond District, 1:00 PM to 7:15 PM, needs 75 minutes (1h15m).\n- Helen: Mission District, 9:45 PM to 10:30 PM, needs 30 minutes.\n- Thomas: Bayview, 3:15 PM to 6:45 PM, needs 120 minutes (2h).\n\nThe user wants to meet as many as possible. Let's see which ones can fit, considering travel times and the required meeting durations.\n\nStarting at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. The earliest they can leave is 9:00 AM. Let's see the possible first meetings.\n\nBut looking at the friends' times, Helen is only available from 9:45 PM, which is late. So maybe Helen is the last meeting. Let's check the others first.\n\nMary is available from 1 PM to 7:15 PM. Sarah from 2:45 PM to 5:30 PM. Thomas from 3:15 PM to 6:45 PM.\n\nThe user needs to meet Sarah for 105 minutes. Let's see when that can fit. Sarah's window is 2:45 PM to 5:30 PM. So the latest start time for Sarah would be 5:30 PM minus 1h45m, which is 3:45 PM. So Sarah's meeting has to start between 2:45 PM and 3:45 PM, and end by 5:30 PM.\n\nMary needs 75 minutes. Her window is 1 PM to 7:15 PM. So any 1h15m slot within that.\n\nThomas needs 120 minutes (2h) between 3:15 PM and 6:45 PM. So latest start time would be 6:45 PM - 2h = 4:45 PM.\n\nSo possible conflicts between Sarah, Mary, and Thomas. Let's see if we can fit all three, but need to check travel times.\n\nLet's think of possible sequences.\n\nOption 1: Start with Mary, then Sarah, then Thomas.\n\nStarting at Haight-Ashbury. Travel to Richmond District (Mary) takes 10 minutes. If leave at 9:00 AM, arrive at 9:10 AM. But Mary isn't available until 1 PM. So that's too early. So Mary can't be met before 1 PM. So maybe first meet someone else, but the only other available before 1 PM is Helen? But Helen is available from 9:45 PM. Wait, no. Helen's time is 9:45 PM to 10:30 PM. So that's in the evening. So maybe the user can't meet anyone before 1 PM except perhaps Mary, but Mary's availability starts at 1 PM.\n\nWait, starting at 9 AM, the user has time from 9 AM to 1 PM. Are there any friends available during that time? The constraints only mention Sarah (2:45 PM onwards), Mary (1 PM onwards), Helen (9:45 PM), and Thomas (3:15 PM onwards). So between 9 AM and 1 PM, no one is available except maybe Mary starting at 1 PM. So maybe the user can do some travel in the morning but no meetings. But since the user wants to maximize meetings, perhaps they can meet Mary first at 1 PM, then Sarah, then Thomas, then Helen.\n\nWait, let's outline possible schedule:\n\nStart at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. Let's see:\n\nFrom 9 AM to 1 PM: 4 hours. But no meetings possible. Unless there's a friend I'm missing. The constraints are Sarah, Mary, Helen, Thomas. So maybe the user has to wait until 1 PM to meet Mary.\n\nSo let's plan:\n\n1. Meet Mary in Richmond District starting at 1 PM. But need to travel there. From Haight-Ashbury to Richmond is 10 minutes. So leave at 12:50 PM, arrive 1 PM. Then meet Mary for 75 minutes (1h15m), ending at 2:15 PM.\n\nThen, next, travel to Fisherman's Wharf for Sarah. From Richmond to Fisherman's Wharf is 18 minutes. So leave at 2:15 PM, arrive at 2:33 PM. But Sarah is available from 2:45 PM. So wait until 2:45 PM. So start meeting Sarah at 2:45 PM. Need 105 minutes, which ends at 4:30 PM.\n\nThen, next, go to Thomas in Bayview. Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26 minutes. Leave at 4:30 PM, arrive at 4:56 PM. Thomas is available until 6:45 PM. Need 120 minutes. So 4:56 PM to 6:56 PM. But Thomas's window ends at 6:45 PM. So this won't work. The meeting would have to end by 6:45 PM, so start time would be 6:45 PM - 120 minutes = 4:45 PM. But arriving at 4:56 PM is too late. So this schedule doesn't work.\n\nAlternative: Adjust Sarah's meeting to end earlier. Let's see. If Sarah's meeting starts at 2:45 PM and needs 105 minutes, ends at 4:30 PM. Then travel to Thomas's location (Bayview) takes 26 minutes, arriving at 4:56 PM. Thomas's latest start time is 4:45 PM (to end at 6:45 PM). So arriving at 4:56 PM would miss 11 minutes. So can't meet Thomas for the full 120 minutes. So maybe need to adjust Sarah's meeting time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start Sarah's meeting earlier. But Sarah is only available from 2:45 PM. So earliest start is 2:45 PM.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe meet Thomas first after Mary. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Mary until 2:15 PM, travel to Bayview. From Richmond to Bayview is 26 minutes. So leave at 2:15 PM, arrive 2:41 PM. Thomas is available from 3:15 PM. So have to wait until 3:15 PM. Then meet Thomas for 120 minutes until 5:15 PM. Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf. Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes. Arrive at 5:40 PM. Sarah's window ends at 5:30 PM. So can't meet Sarah. So this doesn't work either.\n\nHmm. So maybe meeting Sarah first after Mary? Let's try another order.\n\nMary (1 PM - 2:15 PM), then Sarah (2:45 PM - 4:30 PM), then Thomas.\n\nBut as before, arrival at Bayview at 4:56 PM, which is after Thomas's latest possible start time (4:45 PM). So Thomas's meeting would have to be 4:56 PM to 6:56 PM, but he's only available until 6:45 PM. So that's 109 minutes, which is less than the required 120. So that's not enough.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe meet Thomas before Sarah. Let's see:\n\nAfter Mary, go to Thomas. From Richmond to Bayview is 26 minutes. So leaving at 2:15 PM (after meeting Mary until 2:15 PM), arrive at 2:41 PM. Thomas is available at 3:15 PM. Wait until 3:15 PM. Then meet until 5:15 PM (120 minutes). Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf (25 minutes, arrives 5:40 PM). Sarah's window ends at 5:30 PM. So can't meet her. So this also doesn't work.\n\nAlternative plan: Maybe meet Thomas first. But Thomas is available from 3:15 PM. Let's see. Start at Haight-Ashbury. Let's see if the user can meet someone else before 3:15 PM.\n\nMary is available from 1 PM. So possible to meet Mary from 1 PM to 2:15 PM (75 mins). Then travel to Thomas's location (Bayview). From Richmond to Bayview is 26 minutes. Arrive at 2:41 PM. But Thomas starts at 3:15 PM. So wait until 3:15 PM. Meet until 5:15 PM. Then travel to Sarah's location (Fisherman's Wharf). From Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes. Arrive at 5:40 PM. Sarah's window ends at 5:30 PM. So again, can't meet Sarah.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Mary until 2:15 PM, go to Sarah. From Richmond to Fisherman's Wharf is 18 minutes. Arrive at 2:33 PM. Sarah starts at 2:45 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM. Meet until 4:30 PM. Then travel to Thomas's location (Bayview) from Fisherman's Wharf: 26 minutes. Arrive at 4:56 PM. Thomas's latest start is 4:45 PM. So can only meet from 4:56 PM to 6:45 PM (109 minutes), which is less than 120. So not enough.\n\nHmm. So maybe Thomas can't be scheduled if we want to meet Sarah and Mary. Alternatively, maybe meet Thomas for a shorter time? But the requirement is a minimum of 120 minutes. So that's not possible. So perhaps Thomas can't be included if we need to meet Sarah and Mary. Alternatively, can we fit Thomas and Sarah, but not Mary?\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Thomas first, then Sarah, then Mary? Let's check:\n\nStart at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. Let's see if possible to meet Thomas after 3:15 PM. But Mary is available from 1 PM. So perhaps:\n\n1. Meet Mary from 1 PM to 2:15 PM.\n\nThen go to Sarah. But if we go to Sarah after Mary, the timing as before leads to missing Thomas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Sarah first, then Thomas, then Mary.\n\nBut Sarah is available from 2:45 PM. So how to get there from Haight-Ashbury. Let's see:\n\nIf the user starts at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. They have free time until Sarah's window. So maybe leave early to Fisherman's Wharf. But Sarah's window starts at 2:45 PM. So the user could arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 2:45 PM. Travel time from Haight-Ashbury is 23 minutes. So leave at 2:22 PM. But from 9 AM to 2:22 PM, the user has time. Could they meet Mary in the morning? But Mary is available from 1 PM. So maybe meet Mary from 1 PM to 2:15 PM (75 mins), then go to Sarah.\n\nBut Mary is in Richmond District. So from Haight-Ashbury to Richmond is 10 minutes. So leave at 12:50 PM, arrive 1 PM. Meet until 2:15 PM. Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf: 18 minutes. So arrive at 2:33 PM. Sarah starts at 2:45 PM. So wait until 2:45 PM. Meet until 4:30 PM. Then go to Thomas. From Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26 minutes. Arrive at 4:56 PM. Meet Thomas until 6:45 PM (since he's available until then). 4:56 PM to 6:45 PM is 109 minutes, which is less than 120. So can't meet Thomas's minimum. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Sarah until 4:30 PM, go to Thomas but can't meet the 120 minutes. So maybe skip Thomas and go to Mary again? But Mary is available until 7:15 PM. Wait, but Mary's meeting was already done from 1 PM to 2:15 PM. So perhaps not. But the user can't meet Mary again, as per the constraints. The problem says \"meet as many friends as possible\", but each friend once. So Mary is already met.\n\nSo in this scenario, the user meets Mary and Sarah, and possibly Thomas but not fulfilling his minimum. So that's not acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps meet Thomas and Sarah, and not Mary.\n\nLet's try that. Start at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. Go to Thomas first. But Thomas is available from 3:15 PM. So need to get to Bayview by 3:15 PM. Travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Bayview is 18 minutes. So leave at 2:57 PM, arrive at 3:15 PM. Meet until 5:15 PM (120 minutes). Then go to Fisherman's Wharf. Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes. Arrive at 5:40 PM. Sarah's window ends at 5:30 PM. So can't meet Sarah. Alternatively, if Sarah's meeting is before Thomas. So Sarah's meeting must be from 2:45 PM to 4:30 PM. Then travel to Thomas's location (26 minutes) arrives 4:56 PM. Meet until 6:56 PM, but Thomas's window ends at 6:45 PM. So 4:56 PM to 6:45 PM is 109 minutes. Not enough. So again, can't meet Thomas's 120.\n\nHmm. So maybe it's impossible to meet both Sarah and Thomas. So perhaps the optimal schedule is to meet Mary, Sarah, and Helen, but not Thomas. Let's check that.\n\nMary: 1 PM to 2:15 PM.\n\nSarah: 2:45 PM to 4:30 PM.\n\nThen Helen: 9:45 PM to 10:15 PM (30 minutes). But need to check travel times.\n\nAfter Sarah's meeting ends at 4:30 PM, there's a lot of time until Helen's availability at 9:45 PM. But maybe there's a way to meet Thomas in between. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf after Sarah's meeting ends at 4:30 PM, travel to Bayview. Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26 minutes. Arrive at 4:56 PM. Thomas is available until 6:45 PM. So meeting from 4:56 PM to 6:45 PM is 109 minutes. Not enough for Thomas's 120. So that's still not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust Sarah's meeting to end earlier so that Thomas can be met for the required time. For example, if Sarah's meeting starts earlier, but she's only available from 2:45 PM. So earliest start is 2:45 PM, ending at 4:30 PM. No way to start earlier.\n\nAlternative idea: What if we meet Thomas first, then Mary, then Sarah? Let's see:\n\nThomas available from 3:15 PM. So need to arrive at Bayview by 3:15 PM. Travel time from Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes. So leave at 2:57 PM, arrive 3:15 PM. Meet until 5:15 PM. Then travel to Mary's location (Richmond District). Bayview to Richmond District is 25 minutes. Arrive at 5:40 PM. Mary is available until 7:15 PM. Meet her from 5:40 PM to 6:55 PM (75 mins). Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf. Richmond to Fisherman's Wharf is 18 minutes. Arrive at 7:13 PM. Sarah's window ends at 5:30 PM. So can't meet Sarah. So Sarah is missed. So this is worse.\n\nAlternatively, meet Mary first, then Thomas, but then can't meet Sarah. So perhaps the maximum number of meetings possible is Mary, Sarah, and Helen. Helen's meeting is short and late. Let's check:\n\nMary: 1 PM to 2:15 PM (75 mins).\n\nSarah: 2:45 PM to 4:30 PM (105 mins).\n\nThen travel to Mission District (Helen) from Fisherman's Wharf. Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District is 22 minutes. So leave at 4:30 PM, arrive at 4:52 PM. But Helen is available from 9:45 PM. So that's a long wait. So the user can't meet Helen until 9:45 PM. So after meeting Sarah, they have from 4:30 PM until 9:45 PM free. Then meet Helen from 9:45 PM to 10:15 PM (30 mins). So this works. So three meetings: Mary, Sarah, Helen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Thomas instead of Helen. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Sarah at 4:30 PM, go to Thomas. Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26 mins. Arrive at 4:56 PM. Meet until 6:45 PM (109 mins). But Thomas needs 120 mins. So not possible. So Helen is the only option here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Mary, Thomas, and Helen. Let's see:\n\nMary from 1 PM to 2:15 PM. Then travel to Bayview (26 mins). Arrive at 2:41 PM. Thomas's window starts at 3:15 PM. Wait until 3:15 PM. Meet until 5:15 PM. Then travel to Helen's location (Mission District). Bayview to Mission District is 13 mins. Arrive at 5:28 PM. Helen isn't available until 9:45 PM. So a long wait. Then meet Helen at 9:45 PM. So that's two meetings: Mary and Thomas, plus Helen. But Sarah is missed. So comparing which combination is better: three meetings (Mary, Sarah, Helen) vs two (Mary, Thomas, Helen). Since the user wants to meet as many as possible, three is better. So the former is better.\n\nThus, the optimal schedule is Mary, Sarah, and Helen.\n\nNow, let's check the travel times for this plan:\n\n1. Start at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM.\n\nAvailable until 1 PM. Then go to Richmond District (10 mins). Leave at 12:50 PM, arrive 1 PM. Meet Mary until 2:15 PM.\n\nThen travel to Fisherman's Wharf (18 mins). Leave at 2:15 PM, arrive at 2:33 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM, meet Sarah until 4:30 PM.\n\nThen travel to Mission District (Helen's location) at 9:45 PM. But between 4:30 PM and 9:45 PM, there's a gap. Let's see travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District is 22 mins. So the user could go there early, but Helen isn't available until 9:45 PM. So perhaps they can spend the time elsewhere, but for scheduling, we just need to arrive by 9:45 PM.\n\nSo from Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District is 22 mins. So leave at 9:23 PM, arrive at 9:45 PM. Meet Helen from 9:45 PM to 10:15 PM (30 mins).\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n[\n  { \"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Richmond District\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:15\" },\n  { \"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"Sarah\", \"start_time\": \"14:45\", \"end_time\": \"16:30\" },\n  { \"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Mission District\", \"person\": \"Helen\", \"start_time\": \"21:45\", \"end_time\": \"22:15\" }\n]\n\nThis meets all three friends with their required minimum times, and accounts for travel times between locations. Thomas can't be fit in without overlapping or missing the required duration. So this seems to be the optimal solution.",
