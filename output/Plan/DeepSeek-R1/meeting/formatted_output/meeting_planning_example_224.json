            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM and wants to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and constraints. Let's break down the information.\n\nFirst, the friends available are Melissa, Nancy, and Emily. Let's check their availability and required meeting durations.\n\nMelissa is at Golden Gate Park from 8:30 AM to 8 PM. Need at least 15 minutes with her. Since the user starts at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM, the earliest possible time to meet Melissa would be after traveling there. The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park is 25 minutes. So arrival at 9:25 AM. Melissa is available until 8 PM, so meeting her first makes sense. But the user needs to meet her for 15 minutes. Maybe slot her in early.\n\nThen, Emily is in Richmond District from 4:45 PM to 10 PM, needing 120 minutes. That's two hours. And Nancy is at Presidio from 7:45 PM to 10 PM, needing 105 minutes (1h45m). However, Nancy's available time starts at 7:45 PM, which is after Emily's availability starts.\n\nSo the challenge is fitting Emily's 2-hour meeting and Nancy's 1h45m meeting, plus Melissa's 15 minutes. Let's see the time constraints.\n\nStarting at 9 AM. Let's plan the order.\n\nOption 1: Meet Melissa first. Then go to Emily, then Nancy.\n\nTravel from Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park: 25 minutes. So leaving at 9 AM, arrive 9:25. Meet Melissa from 9:25 to say 9:40 (15 minutes). Then, travel to Emily's location. From Golden Gate Park to Richmond District is 7 minutes. So leave 9:40, arrive 9:47. But Emily is only available from 4:45 PM. So that's way too early. So can't meet Emily yet. So this approach doesn't work. So maybe meet Melissa later.\n\nAlternative idea: Since Emily is available after 4:45 PM, perhaps schedule Emily first in the evening, then Nancy. But wait, Nancy starts at 7:45 PM, so after Emily. Let's think.\n\nWait, the user is starting at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM. Let's see possible sequences.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe meet Melissa first, then during the day, then Emily, then Nancy.\n\nBut need to fit the meetings considering travel times.\n\nWait, let's outline the possible orderings.\n\nPossible meetings:\n\n1. Melissa (Golden Gate Park): earliest arrival 9:25 AM, latest departure is 8 PM. But she can be met any time in between. The user needs at least 15 minutes with her.\n\n2. Emily (Richmond District): available from 4:45 PM to 10 PM, needs 120 minutes (until 6:45 PM start time? Because 6:45 PM + 2 hours is 8:45 PM, but she's available until 10 PM. So the latest start time would be 8 PM (since 8 PM to 10 PM is 2 hours). But need to consider travel time after previous meetings.\n\n3. Nancy (Presidio): available from 7:45 PM to 10 PM, needs 105 minutes. So she needs 1h45m. The latest start time would be 8:15 PM (since 8:15 PM + 1h45m = 10 PM). But the user must arrive there by that time.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- Start at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM.\n\nSo possible orderings. Let's consider the latest possible time for each meeting.\n\nBut how to fit all three?\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Melissa early, then Emily, then Nancy.\n\nBut Emily can't be met until 4:45 PM. So between 9 AM and 4:45 PM, the user could meet Melissa, but how?\n\nWait, Melissa is available from 8:30 AM to 8 PM, so after meeting her early, the user could have a lot of time before Emily's availability. So maybe meet Melissa in the morning, then do something else (but the user wants to meet as many friends as possible; here, only three, so all three if possible). So the plan must fit all three.\n\nBut let's check the times:\n\nAssuming we need to meet all three (Melissa, Emily, Nancy), we need to schedule their meetings with travel times in between.\n\nLet's start with the latest possible meetings and work backward.\n\nNancy needs to start by 8:15 PM (to end at 10 PM). Let's say we want to meet Nancy from 8:15 PM to 10 PM. But the user has to arrive at Presidio by 8:15 PM. Where would the user be before that?\n\nEmily's meeting is 2 hours. Let's say the user meets Emily from 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM. Then, travel from Richmond District to Presidio takes 7 minutes. So leave at 6:45 PM, arrive at Presidio at 6:52 PM. But Nancy isn't available until 7:45 PM. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe meet Emily later. For example, Emily from 5 PM to 7 PM. Then travel to Presidio (7 minutes) arriving at 7:07 PM. But Nancy is available at 7:45 PM. So the user would have a gap from 7:07 PM to 7:45 PM. That's 38 minutes. Maybe that's acceptable, but perhaps we can optimize.\n\nAlternatively, let's see: If Emily is scheduled from 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM (2 hours), then after that, travel to Presidio (7 minutes) arrives at 6:52 PM. Then, need to wait until 7:45 PM to meet Nancy. That's a long wait. Alternatively, adjust Emily's time.\n\nAlternatively, can we schedule Emily later? Let's say Emily from 6 PM to 8 PM. Then, after that, travel to Presidio (7 minutes) arrives at 8:07 PM. Then meet Nancy from 8:07 PM to 9:52 PM (1h45m). But Nancy's available until 10 PM. So 8:07 PM start, ends at 9:52 PM. That works. But then, what about Melissa?\n\nMelissa needs to be met between 8:30 AM and 8 PM. Let's see: The user starts at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM. To meet Melissa, they need to go to Golden Gate Park (25 minutes travel), so arrival at 9:25 AM. Then meet Melissa for 15 minutes (9:25 AM to 9:40 AM). Then, the user has time until Emily's meeting. But Emily starts at 4:45 PM. So from 9:40 AM to 4:45 PM, that's a lot of time. But maybe that's okay. Then, the user needs to travel from Golden Gate Park to Richmond District. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Richmond District is 7 minutes. So leave at 4:38 PM (to arrive at 4:45 PM). But that's cutting it close. Alternatively, perhaps schedule Emily's meeting starting at 4:45 PM. So the user would need to arrive at Richmond District by 4:45 PM. So leaving Golden Gate Park at 4:38 PM (7 minutes travel). But if the user is elsewhere before that, like after meeting Melissa.\n\nWait, after meeting Melissa at 9:40 AM, where would the user be? At Golden Gate Park. Then, the user has until 4:45 PM to meet Emily. But during that time, they could be elsewhere. But since Emily is only available from 4:45 PM, perhaps the user can stay at Golden Gate Park until then? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe they can go to another location, but no other friends are available during the day. So the user might just have free time. But the goal is to meet as many friends as possible, which here is all three if possible.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nMelissa: 9:25 AM - 9:40 AM (15 minutes) at Golden Gate Park.\n\nThen, the user is at Golden Gate Park. Then, needs to go to Richmond District for Emily's meeting. But Emily is available from 4:45 PM. So the user must be at Richmond District by 4:45 PM. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Richmond District is 7 minutes. So the user can leave Golden Gate Park at 4:38 PM, arrive at 4:45 PM. But between 9:40 AM and 4:38 PM, there's a lot of time (about 7 hours). But there's no other friends available, so perhaps that's acceptable. Then meet Emily from 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM (2 hours). Then travel to Presidio (7 minutes from Richmond District), arriving at 6:52 PM. Then, need to wait until 7:45 PM to meet Nancy. So from 6:52 PM to 7:45 PM is 53 minutes. Then meet Nancy from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM (105 minutes). But wait, Nancy is available until 10 PM, so the user can start at 7:45 PM and end at 9:30 PM (105 minutes). Then, done.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust Emily's time to end earlier so that the user can travel to Presidio and start with Nancy earlier. But Nancy is only available from 7:45 PM. So the earliest Nancy can be met is 7:45 PM. So even if the user arrives at Presidio earlier, they have to wait until 7:45 PM.\n\nSo the possible schedule:\n\n1. Melissa: 9:25 AM - 9:40 AM (Golden Gate Park)\n2. Emily: 4:45 PM - 6:45 PM (Richmond District)\n3. Nancy: 7:45 PM - 9:30 PM (Presidio)\n\nBut let's check the travel times between these.\n\nAfter meeting Melissa at Golden Gate Park (ends 9:40 AM), the user stays there until leaving for Richmond District. They leave Golden Gate Park at 4:38 PM (7 minutes travel to arrive at Richmond District at 4:45 PM). So that's a lot of waiting time, but that's unavoidable.\n\nThen after Emily's meeting (ends 6:45 PM), travel to Presidio takes 7 minutes (from Richmond District to Presidio is 7 minutes). Arrive at 6:52 PM. Then wait until 7:45 PM (53 minutes). Then meet Nancy from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM (105 minutes). That works.\n\nAlternatively, can we adjust Emily's meeting to start later so that after traveling to Presidio, the waiting time is less? For example, if Emily's meeting is from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM. Then, travel to Presidio (7 minutes), arrive 7:37 PM. Then wait until 7:45 PM (8 minutes) to meet Nancy. That would reduce waiting time. But Emily's meeting requires 2 hours, so starting at 5:30 PM would end at 7:30 PM. Then travel to Presidio arrives 7:37 PM. Then meet Nancy from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM. That's better.\n\nBut is Emily available until 10 PM? Yes. So she can meet from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM. Then, after that, travel to Presidio (7 minutes), arrive 7:37 PM. Then wait 8 minutes until Nancy is available. Then meet Nancy from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM. That's a better use of time.\n\nSo let's try this schedule:\n\n1. Meet Melissa: 9:25 AM - 9:40 AM (Golden Gate Park)\n2. Emily: 5:30 PM - 7:30 PM (Richmond District)\n3. Nancy: 7:45 PM - 9:30 PM (Presidio)\n\nBut wait, how does the user get from Golden Gate Park to Richmond District in time for Emily's meeting?\n\nAfter Melissa's meeting ends at 9:40 AM, the user is at Golden Gate Park. They need to get to Richmond District by 5:30 PM. But they can stay at Golden Gate Park until leaving for Richmond District. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Richmond District is 7 minutes, so leave at 5:23 PM to arrive at 5:30 PM. But that leaves a lot of time in between. But that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can leave Golden Gate Park earlier and explore, but according to the problem, the goal is to meet friends, not other activities. So the user might just wait. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut the problem is that the user is free from 9:40 AM to 5:23 PM (which is 7 hours and 43 minutes). But since there's no other friends available during that time, that's unavoidable.\n\nAlternatively, could the user meet Emily earlier? But Emily is available only from 4:45 PM. So the earliest Emily can start is 4:45 PM. So Emily's meeting could be 4:45 PM - 6:45 PM, then travel to Presidio (7 minutes), arriving at 6:52 PM. Then wait until 7:45 PM (53 minutes), then meet Nancy. But this way, Emily's meeting is earlier, but the user would have less waiting time between Emily and Nancy if they adjust Emily's meeting to end later.\n\nBut the user's goal is to meet as many friends as possible, which they can do in all three. So the main thing is to ensure all three meetings fit with the required durations and travel times.\n\nSo the possible schedule is:\n\n- Meet Melissa at 9:25 AM - 9:40 AM (Golden Gate Park)\n- Travel to Richmond District, arriving at 4:45 PM (leave Golden Gate Park at 4:38 PM)\n- Meet Emily from 4:45 PM - 6:45 PM\n- Travel to Presidio (7 minutes), arrive 6:52 PM\n- Wait until 7:45 PM, then meet Nancy until 9:30 PM.\n\nAlternatively, shift Emily's meeting later:\n\n- Melissa 9:25-9:40\n- Emily 5:30-7:30 (Richmond)\n- Travel to Presidio: 7:30 +7 min =7:37 arrival\n- Nancy from 7:45-9:30 (Presidio)\n\nBut this requires Emily's meeting to be 5:30-7:30 PM, which is within her availability (4:45 PM to 10 PM). So that works.\n\nSo which schedule is better? The second one has less waiting time between Emily and Nancy. The user arrives at Presidio at 7:37 PM, waits 8 minutes until 7:45 PM. That's better than waiting 53 minutes.\n\nSo this seems more efficient.\n\nBut how does the user get from Golden Gate Park to Richmond District for Emily's meeting at 5:30 PM? The user is at Golden Gate Park after meeting Melissa. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Richmond District is 7 minutes. So leave Golden Gate Park at 5:23 PM, arrive at 5:30 PM. But from 9:40 AM to 5:23 PM, the user is free. That's a long time, but perhaps unavoidable.\n\nAlternatively, can the user meet Melissa later in the day to reduce the gap?\n\nFor example, meet Melissa in the afternoon, then go to Emily.\n\nBut Melissa is available until 8 PM. Suppose we meet Melissa later. Let's say after Emily's meeting. Wait, no. Because Emily's meeting is in Richmond District, and Melissa is at Golden Gate Park. Let's see:\n\nIf the user starts at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM, maybe they can go to Golden Gate Park first, then later go to Richmond District, then Presidio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe schedule Melissa in the afternoon. For example:\n\nMeet Melissa from 3:00 PM to 3:15 PM (Golden Gate Park). Then travel to Richmond District (7 minutes, arrive 3:22 PM). But Emily is available only from 4:45 PM. So can't meet Emily until 4:45 PM. So there's a gap from 3:22 PM to 4:45 PM. That's 1h23m. Then meet Emily from 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM. Then to Presidio (7 min, arrive 6:52 PM. Wait until 7:45 PM. Then Nancy until 9:30 PM.\n\nThis way, the gap between Melissa and Emily is 1h23m, which is better than the previous scenario's 7h+ gap. But is this possible?\n\nBut how to get to Golden Gate Park for Melissa's meeting at 3 PM. The user starts at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM. So they could leave any time. For example, leave Fisherman's Wharf at 2:35 PM (travel time 25 minutes to Golden Gate Park, arrive 3:00 PM). Then meet Melissa from 3:00 PM to 3:15 PM. Then travel to Richmond District (7 minutes, arrive 3:22 PM). Then wait until 4:45 PM (1h23m) to meet Emily.\n\nThat's better than the previous plan where the user waits 7 hours. So this seems more efficient.\n\nBut wait, this requires the user to stay at Fisherman's Wharf until 2:35 PM. But is there any constraint on when they can leave? The user starts at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM, but can leave anytime after that.\n\nSo this approach would allow the user to meet Melissa later, reducing the waiting time between meetings.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n- Leave Fisherman's Wharf at 2:35 PM, arrive at Golden Gate Park at 3:00 PM (25 min travel)\n- Meet Melissa 3:00 PM - 3:15 PM\n- Travel to Richmond District (7 min) arrive 3:22 PM\n- Wait until 4:45 PM (1h23m)\n- Meet Emily 4:45 PM - 6:45 PM\n- Travel to Presidio (7 min) arrive 6:52 PM\n- Wait until 7:45 PM (53 min)\n- Meet Nancy 7:45 PM - 9:30 PM\n\nThis way, the user meets all three friends. The waiting times are reduced compared to the first plan.\n\nBut is there a way to further optimize? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Melissa at 3:15 PM, can the user do something else before Emily's availability? But there's no other friends available. So the user has to wait until 4:45 PM. So that's unavoidable.\n\nAnother option: Maybe meet Emily first, then Melissa, then Nancy. But Emily is available from 4:45 PM. So the earliest possible Emily meeting is 4:45 PM. Then meet Melissa after that. But Melissa is available until 8 PM. So after Emily's meeting, travel to Golden Gate Park. Let's see:\n\nIf Emily is from 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM (Richmond District), then travel to Golden Gate Park (9 minutes from Richmond to Golden Gate Park), arrive 6:54 PM. Meet Melissa from 6:54 PM to 7:09 PM (15 minutes). Then travel to Presidio (11 minutes from Golden Gate Park to Presidio), arrive 7:20 PM. But Nancy is available from 7:45 PM. So wait until 7:45 PM, then meet Nancy until 9:30 PM. But that's possible.\n\nBut in this case, the user would meet Emily, then Melissa, then Nancy. Let's check the constraints.\n\nBut wait, the user starts at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM. So how to get to Emily's meeting at 4:45 PM. They need to travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District. Travel time is 18 minutes. So leave at 4:27 PM, arrive 4:45 PM. Then meet Emily until 6:45 PM. Then travel to Golden Gate Park (9 minutes) arrive 6:54 PM. Meet Melissa until 7:09 PM. Then travel to Presidio (12 minutes from Golden Gate Park to Presidio), arrive 7:21 PM. Then wait until 7:45 PM to meet Nancy. That's 24 minutes. Then meet Nancy from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM.\n\nThis way, all three meetings are scheduled. The advantage is that the user doesn't have a long waiting period during the day. They can stay at Fisherman's Wharf until 4:27 PM (leaving for Richmond District), which is 7h27m after arrival. But is that allowed? The user can stay there as long as they want, I think. The problem states they arrive at 9 AM but can move around.\n\nThis schedule allows meeting all three friends with minimal waiting time:\n\n1. Emily: 4:45 PM - 6:45 PM (Richmond District)\n2. Melissa: 6:54 PM -7:09 PM (Golden Gate Park)\n3. Nancy: 7:45 PM -9:30 PM (Presidio)\n\nBut wait, Melissa is available until 8 PM. Meeting her until 7:09 PM is okay. Then travel to Presidio takes 12 minutes (from Golden Gate Park to Presidio is 12 minutes). So arrive at Presidio at 7:21 PM. Then wait until 7:45 PM (24 minutes), then meet Nancy. That works.\n\nBut let's check the travel times again:\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District: 18 minutes. So leaving at 4:27 PM to arrive at 4:45 PM.\n\nFrom Richmond District to Golden Gate Park: 9 minutes. So leaving at 6:45 PM, arrive at 6:54 PM.\n\nFrom Golden Gate Park to Presidio: 12 minutes. Leave at 7:09 PM, arrive at 7:21 PM.\n\nBut the problem is that after meeting Melissa until 7:09 PM, the user needs to travel to Presidio, which takes 12 minutes, arriving at 7:21 PM. Then wait until 7:45 PM.\n\nBut this schedule allows meeting all three friends. So this might be better.\n\nComparing the two options:\n\nOption A:\n\n- Melissa in the afternoon (3 PM), then Emily, then Nancy.\n\nOption B:\n\n- Emily first (4:45 PM), Melissa, then Nancy.\n\nOption B requires leaving Fisherman's Wharf later (4:27 PM), which might be better in terms of waiting time during the day. But the user is free to stay at Fisherman's Wharf until then. However, the user's goal is to meet as many friends as possible, which is achieved in both options.\n\nBut wait, in Option B, the user meets Melissa after Emily. Melissa's meeting is only 15 minutes. But in this case, after Emily's meeting, the user goes to meet Melissa, which is possible because Melissa is available until 8 PM.\n\nSo Option B seems feasible and efficient.\n\nBut what about the minimum meeting durations?\n\nMelissa's meeting is 15 minutes, which is satisfied. Emily's is 2 hours, Nancy's 1h45m. All constraints are met.\n\nBut let's check all travel times:\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District: 18 min (leaving 4:27 PM, arrive 4:45 PM).\n\nFrom Richmond District to Golden Gate Park: 9 min (leave 6:45 PM, arrive 6:54 PM).\n\nMeet Melissa until 7:09 PM.\n\nFrom Golden Gate Park to Presidio: 12 min (leave 7:09 PM, arrive 7:21 PM).\n\nWait until 7:45 PM, then meet Nancy until 9:30 PM.\n\nThat's all valid.\n\nAnother check: After meeting Nancy until 9:30 PM, the user's schedule is done. All times are within the friends' availability.\n\nNow, is there any overlap or missed constraints?\n\nEmily's meeting is from 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM (Richmond District), which is within her availability (4:45 PM to 10 PM). Correct.\n\nMelissa's meeting 6:54 PM to7:09 PM (Golden Gate Park), within her availability (8:30 AM to8 PM). Wait, 7:09 PM is before 8 PM, so okay.\n\nNancy's meeting 7:45 PM to9:30 PM (Presidio), within her availability (7:45 PM to10 PM). Correct.\n\nTravel times are accounted for.\n\nSo this schedule works.\n\nBut what about the initial constraint: The user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. They stay there until 4:27 PM when they leave for Richmond District. That's a long time, but there's no other friends available during the day. So this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, can the user meet Melissa earlier and then do something else? Like, meet Melissa in the morning, then go to Fisherman's Wharf and stay there until leaving for Emily. But that would require traveling back, which adds travel time.\n\nFor example:\n\nMeet Melissa early:\n\nLeave Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM, travel to Golden Gate Park (25 min), arrive 9:25 AM. Meet until 9:40 AM. Then return to Fisherman's Wharf (24 min travel), arriving 10:04 AM. Then stay there until leaving for Richmond District at 4:27 PM (travel 18 min to arrive at 4:45 PM). But this adds unnecessary travel time (back to Fisherman's Wharf), which is 24 minutes, which could be avoided by staying at Golden Gate Park. So Option B is better.\n\nThus, the optimal schedule seems to be:\n\n1. Meet Emily from 4:45 PM to6:45 PM (Richmond District)\n2. Travel to Golden Gate Park (9 minutes), meet Melissa 6:54 PM -7:09 PM\n3. Travel to Presidio (12 minutes), arrive 7:21 PM, wait until 7:45 PM, meet Nancy 7:45 PM -9:30 PM\n\nBut let's verify the travel times again.\n\nFrom Richmond District to Golden Gate Park is 9 minutes. So leaving Richmond District at 6:45 PM (after Emily's meeting ends) arrives at Golden Gate Park at 6:54 PM.\n\nThen, meet Melissa from 6:54 PM to7:09 PM. Then travel to Presidio (Golden Gate Park to Presidio is 12 minutes). Leaves at 7:09 PM, arrives at 7:21 PM. Then wait until 7:45 PM (24 minutes) to meet Nancy. Nancy's meeting is from 7:45 PM to9:30 PM (105 minutes).\n\nYes, this works.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Richmond District\", \"person\": \"Emily\", \"start_time\": \"16:45\", \"end_time\": \"18:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Melissa\", \"start_time\": \"18:54\", \"end_time\": \"19:09\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Presidio\", \"person\": \"Nancy\", \"start_time\": \"19:45\", \"end_time\": \"21:30\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nBut wait, how does the user get from Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District for Emily's meeting?\n\nThe first meeting is in Richmond District. The user starts at Fisherman's Wharf. So the first action is traveling to Richmond District. The JSON should only include the meetings, not travel actions. So the itinerary only lists the meetings, not the travel. So the first meeting is Emily in Richmond District at 16:45. But the user needs to travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Richmond District, which takes 18 minutes. So leave at 16:27, arrive at 16:45. So the itinerary correctly lists the meeting start at 16:45.\n\nSimilarly, between Emily and Melissa, travel time of 9 minutes is accounted for (arriving at 18:54).\n\nSo this schedule is feasible and meets all constraints.",
