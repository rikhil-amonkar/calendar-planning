            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to schedule these meetings. So, the user arrives at Bayview at 9:00 AM. They need to meet Jessica, Sandra, and Jason if possible. Let's look at the constraints.\n\nFirst, Jessica is at Embarcadero from 4:45 PM to 7:00 PM. We need to meet her for at least 30 minutes. Then, Sandra is at Richmond District from 6:30 PM to 9:45 PM, but wants 120 minutes. Jason is at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM, needs 30 minutes. The challenge is fitting all three, considering travel times.\n\nStarting from Bayview at 9 AM. Let's see possible routes. Let's check the earliest possible meetings. Maybe Jason first? But Jason's time is 4 PM to 4:45 PM. So after 4 PM. But Jessica's time starts at 4:45 PM. Wait, maybe we can do Jason first, then Jessica. Let's see.\n\nBut Jason's meeting is 30 minutes. If we arrive at Fisherman's Wharf by 4 PM, meet from 4:00 to 4:30 PM. Then, travel to Embarcadero. The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero is 8 minutes. So we can get there by 4:38 PM. But Jessica is available from 4:45 PM. So there's a 7-minute gap. That works. Then meet Jessica from 4:45 to 5:15 PM (30 minutes). Then, after that, need to go to Richmond District for Sandra. The travel time from Embarcadero to Richmond is 21 minutes. If we leave Embarcadero at 5:15 PM, arrive Richmond at 5:36 PM. But Sandra is available from 6:30 PM. So there's a 54-minute gap. Wait, that's a problem. So maybe that's not the best way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Jessica first. Let's see. But Jessica's time starts at 4:45 PM. So before that, can we fit Jason? Let's see. Jason's time is 4:00-4:45 PM. If we meet Jason at 4:00-4:30 PM, then travel to Embarcadero (8 minutes) to meet Jessica starting at 4:38 PM, but Jessica's available from 4:45 PM. So the earliest we can meet Jessica is 4:45 PM, so maybe that would work. Then meet Jessica from 4:45 to 5:15 PM. Then, travel to Richmond District (21 minutes from Embarcadero), arriving at 5:36 PM. But Sandra isn't available until 6:30 PM. So we have to wait there until 6:30 PM. Then meet Sandra for 2 hours until 8:30 PM. That seems possible. But the time between 5:36 PM and 6:30 PM is 54 minutes of waiting. Not ideal, but maybe that's the only way to fit all three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Sandra first? But Sandra's window is from 6:30 PM. Let's see. If we can meet Jessica first, then Jason, then Sandra. Wait, but Jason's time is earlier. Let me think again.\n\nWait, starting from Bayview at 9 AM. Let's consider the day from 9 AM onward. The user wants to meet as many friends as possible. Let's check each person's availability and required time.\n\nJason is only available until 4:45 PM. He needs 30 minutes. So the latest we can meet him is 4:15 PM start, ending at 4:45 PM. But the travel time from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes. So leaving Bayview at, say, 3:50 PM would get there at 4:15 PM. But that's possible. But then, after meeting Jason, we need to go to Jessica's location. Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero is 8 minutes. So leaving at 4:45 PM, arriving 4:53 PM. But Jessica is available from 4:45 PM. So we can start meeting Jessica at 4:53 PM? But she's available until 7 PM. So meeting from 4:53 to 5:23 PM (30 minutes). Then, need to go to Sandra. From Embarcadero to Richmond is 21 minutes. Leaving at 5:23 PM, arrive at 5:44 PM. But Sandra's available from 6:30 PM. So we have to wait until 6:30 PM. Then meet her for two hours until 8:30 PM. That's possible.\n\nBut that leaves a lot of time in the morning. Maybe there's a way to fit another meeting? Wait, but the only people are Jessica, Sandra, and Jason. So maybe that's the maximum. But wait, let's check if we can meet Jason first, then Jessica, then Sandra, but with optimized times.\n\nAnother approach: Let's start with the earliest possible meetings. From Bayview at 9 AM, maybe spend the day doing other things until the meetings start. But we need to fit Jason at 4 PM, Jessica at 4:45 PM, and Sandra at 6:30 PM.\n\nWait, Jason's slot is 4-4:45 PM. To meet him for 30 minutes, the latest we can start is 4:15 PM (ending at 4:45 PM). So let's plan that. Then, after meeting Jason, go to Jessica. Travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero is 8 minutes. Arrive at 4:53 PM. But Jessica is available from 4:45 PM, so we can start at 4:53 PM and meet until 5:23 PM. Then, leave Embarcadero at 5:23 PM, travel to Richmond District (21 minutes), arriving at 5:44 PM. But Sandra is available at 6:30 PM, so wait until then. Meet Sandra from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM (2 hours). That works.\n\nBut what about the time before 4 PM? From 9 AM to 4 PM, the user is free. Are there any other friends to meet? The problem states \"as many friends as possible\" which are three, so maybe that's the max. So this schedule meets all three, but requires some waiting between meetings.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a way to meet Jessica earlier. Jessica is available from 4:45 PM. But if we can't meet her before that. So the earliest possible meeting with Jessica is 4:45 PM. So the schedule above meets Jason, Jessica, and Sandra.\n\nAlternatively, if we start with Jessica first. Suppose we leave Bayview earlier. Wait, but Jessica's available from 4:45 PM. So no, can't meet her earlier. So the earliest possible time to meet Jessica is 4:45 PM. So the initial plan is the best.\n\nNow, let's check the travel times. From Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes. So to meet Jason at 4:00 PM for 30 minutes (ending at 4:30 PM), we need to arrive by 4:00 PM. So leaving Bayview at 3:35 PM (25 minutes travel). Then after meeting Jason, leave Fisherman's Wharf at 4:30 PM, travel to Embarcadero (8 minutes) arriving 4:38 PM. But Jessica starts at 4:45 PM. So we can start the meeting at 4:45 PM, meet until 5:15 PM. Then travel to Richmond District (21 minutes), arriving 5:36 PM. Sandra is available at 6:30 PM. So that's a 54-minute wait. Then meet Sandra from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM.\n\nAlternatively, if we meet Jason from 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM (to use his full window), then leave at 4:45 PM, travel to Embarcadero (8 minutes), arrive 4:53 PM. Meet Jessica from 4:53 PM to 5:23 PM. Then leave to Richmond District, arriving 5:44 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM, meet Sandra until 8:30 PM.\n\nWhich option is better? Well, the first scenario allows meeting Jason from 4:00-4:30 PM, but leaves a gap before Jessica. The second scenario uses Jason's full availability. But the user wants to meet each person for the minimum required time. So meeting Jason from 4:15-4:45 PM (30 minutes) is okay. Wait, no, Jason's time is 4:00-4:45 PM. If we meet him from 4:15-4:45 PM, that's 30 minutes. But his window ends at 4:45 PM. So ending at 4:45 PM is okay.\n\nWait, Jason's available until 4:45 PM. So the latest we can meet him is 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM. So that's 30 minutes. Then, leaving Fisherman's Wharf at 4:45 PM, take 8 minutes to Embarcadero, arrive 4:53 PM. Jessica is available until 7 PM, so meeting 4:53-5:23 PM (30 minutes). Then, leave to Richmond District at 5:23 PM, arrive 5:44 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM, meet Sandra until 8:30 PM.\n\nThis way, all three are met. So this is possible. Now, check if the user can reach each location in time considering travel times.\n\nLet's outline the itinerary step by step:\n\n1. Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM. The user is free until the first meeting.\n\n2. To meet Jason at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM: Need to leave Bayview at 3:50 PM (25 minutes travel to arrive at 4:15 PM). Wait, no. Travel time from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes. To arrive by 4:15 PM, departure from Bayview should be at 3:50 PM (25 minutes). So arrival at 4:15 PM. Then meet from 4:15 to 4:45 PM. Wait, but Jason's time is 4:00-4:45 PM. So arriving at 4:00 PM would allow a meeting from 4:00-4:30 PM. Alternatively, leaving Bayview earlier. But if the user has free time until then, they can leave Bayview at 3:35 PM to arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 4:00 PM. Then meet from 4:00-4:30 PM, then leave for Embarcadero.\n\nSo possible schedule:\n\n- Meet Jason: Fisherman's Wharf, 4:00-4:30 PM.\n\n- Travel to Embarcadero: 8 minutes, arrive 4:38 PM. Then wait until 4:45 PM to meet Jessica.\n\n- Meet Jessica: 4:45-5:15 PM.\n\n- Travel to Richmond District: 21 minutes, arrive 5:36 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM.\n\n- Meet Sandra: 6:30-8:30 PM.\n\nThis way, all three meetings are scheduled, each for the minimum required time, and travel times are accounted for. The user starts at Bayview, but they can leave whenever needed. The constraints are met.\n\nNow, checking the constraints again:\n\n- Jessica's time is 4:45 PM to 7 PM. Meeting from 4:45-5:15 PM (30 minutes) is okay.\n\n- Sandra's time is 6:30 PM to 9:45 PM. Meeting from 6:30-8:30 PM (2 hours) is okay.\n\n- Jason's time is 4:00-4:45 PM. Meeting from 4:00-4:30 PM (30 minutes) is okay.\n\nTravel times are correctly calculated. So this seems feasible.\n\nThe only thing left is to check the initial part: the user arrives at Bayview at 9 AM. The first meeting is at 4 PM. So the user has free time from 9 AM to when they leave for Fisherman's Wharf. Let's calculate when they need to leave Bayview. To arrive at Fisherman's Wharf by 4:00 PM, travel time is 25 minutes. So leave Bayview at 3:35 PM. So the user can stay in Bayview until 3:35 PM, then leave. The itinerary would look like:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"meet\",\n    \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n    \"person\": \"Jason\",\n    \"start_time\": \"16:00\",\n    \"end_time\": \"16:30\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"meet\",\n    \"location\": \"Embarcadero\",\n    \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n    \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n    \"end_time\": \"17:15\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"meet\",\n    \"location\": \"Richmond District\",\n    \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n    \"start_time\": \"18:30\",\n    \"end_time\": \"20:30\"\n  }\n]\n\nBut wait, after meeting Jason, the travel to Embarcadero is 8 minutes. So leaving Fisherman's Wharf at 16:30, arrive at Embarcadero at 16:38. Then Jessica is available starting at 16:45. So the meeting can start at 16:45. So the meeting is 16:45-17:15. Then, leave Embarcadero at 17:15, travel to Richmond District (21 minutes), arrive at 17:36. Wait until 18:30, then meet Sandra.\n\nYes, that works. So the JSON should have three meetings in the itinerary. The problem states to include all meetings in the itinerary. So the correct JSON would list each meeting in order.",
