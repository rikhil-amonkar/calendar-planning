            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and the given constraints. Let's start by listing all the people and their availability:\n\n1. **Mark** (Marina District) from 6:45PM to 9:00PM, needs 90 minutes.\n2. **Karen** (Financial District) 9:30AM-12:45PM, 90 minutes.\n3. **Barbara** (Alamo Square) 10:00AM-7:30PM, 90 minutes.\n4. **Nancy** (Golden Gate Park) 4:45PM-8:00PM, 105 minutes.\n5. **David** (The Castro) 9:00AM-6:00PM, 120 minutes.\n6. **Linda** (Bayview) 6:15PM-7:45PM, 45 minutes.\n7. **Kevin** (Sunset District) 10:00AM-5:45PM, 120 minutes.\n8. **Matthew** (Haight-Ashbury) 10:15AM-3:30PM, 45 minutes.\n9. **Andrew** (Nob Hill) 11:45AM-4:45PM, 105 minutes.\n\nStarting at Russian Hill at 9:00AM. Let's think about the order.\n\nFirst, Karen is available earliest. She's in the Financial District from 9:30AM. But we start at Russian Hill. Travel time to Financial District is 11 minutes. So earliest arrival is 9:11AM, but Karen starts at 9:30AM. So possible to meet Karen from 9:30AM. Need 90 minutes, so until 11:00AM. But wait, after Karen, where to go next?\n\nBut also, David is available all day (9AM-6PM) and needs 120 minutes. Maybe we can meet David first. Let's check: Starting at Russian Hill at 9:00AM. Travel to The Castro takes 21 minutes (from Russian Hill to Castro). Arrive at 9:21AM. But David is available from 9AM. So start meeting David at 9:21, but need 2 hours. So from 9:21 to 11:21. But Karen's window is until 12:45PM. Maybe after David, go to Karen. But wait, David's meeting would end at 11:21, then travel from Castro to Financial District. Let's check travel time: The Castro to Financial District is 21 minutes. So leaving Castro at 11:21, arrive at Financial District at 11:42. Karen's available until 12:45PM. So from 11:42 to 12:45 is 63 minutes, which is less than the required 90. That's a problem. So maybe meeting Karen first is better.\n\nAlternatively, meet Karen first. Start at 9:00AM, leave Russian Hill at 9:00, travel 11 minutes to Financial District, arrive 9:11. Karen starts at 9:30, so we have to wait until 9:30. So meet Karen from 9:30 to 11:00 (90 minutes). Then, after that, go to David. Travel from Financial District to Castro: 20 minutes. So leave at 11:00, arrive 11:20. Then meet David from 11:20 to 13:20 (2 hours). But David is available until 6PM, so that works. Then after David, maybe Barbara in Alamo Square. Let's see.\n\nWait, after meeting David until 13:20 (1:20PM), then travel to Alamo Square. Castro to Alamo Square is 8 minutes. Arrive 13:28. Barbara is available until 7:30PM. So meet Barbara from 13:28 to 14:58 (90 minutes). Then next, maybe Andrew at Nob Hill. Alamo Square to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. So leave at 14:58, arrive 15:09. Andrew is available until 4:45PM. Need 105 minutes (1h45m). So from 15:09 to 16:54. That's possible. Then after that, go to Nancy at Golden Gate Park. Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park is 17 minutes. Leave at 16:54, arrive 17:11. Nancy is available from 16:45 (4:45PM) to 8PM. Need 105 minutes (1h45m). So meet from 17:11 to 18:56. Then, after that, need to meet Linda in Bayview. Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 22 minutes. So leave at 18:56, arrive 19:18. But Linda is available from 6:15PM (18:15) to 19:45. But arrival at 19:18, and need 45 minutes. So meet from 19:18 to 20:03, but Linda's window ends at 19:45. So that's a problem. Only 27 minutes available. Not enough. So that's a conflict. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, after Nancy, maybe go to Mark in Marina District. Golden Gate Park to Marina is 16 minutes. Leave at 18:56, arrive 19:12. Mark is available from 18:45 (6:45PM) to 21:00. Need 90 minutes. So meet from 19:12 to 20:42. That's possible. Then Linda's window is 18:15 to 19:45. But after meeting Mark until 20:42, Linda's time is already over. So can't meet Linda in this schedule.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the order to include Linda. Maybe after Andrew, instead of Nancy, go to Linda first? Let's see. After Andrew ends at 16:54, go to Bayview. Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 minutes. Arrive at 17:13. Linda is available until 19:45. Meet from 17:13 to 17:58 (45 minutes). Then go to Nancy. Bayview to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes. Arrive at 18:20. Meet Nancy from 18:20 to 20:05 (105 minutes). But Nancy's window ends at 20:00, so 18:20 to 20:00 is 100 minutes. Not enough. So 105 minutes needed. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Barbara, go to Kevin in Sunset District. Alamo Square to Sunset District is 16 minutes. Barbara's meeting ends at 14:58, leave at 14:58, arrive 15:14. Kevin is available until 17:45. Need 120 minutes. So meet from 15:14 to 17:14. Then next, go to Andrew. Sunset District to Nob Hill is 24 minutes. Arrive at 17:38. Andrew's window ends at 16:45, so too late. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm. Let's re-express the problem. The main constraints are:\n\n- Karen (9:30AM-12:45PM) needs 90 min.\n- David (9AM-6PM) needs 120 min.\n- Kevin (10AM-5:45PM) needs 120 min.\n- Andrew (11:45AM-4:45PM) needs 105 min.\n- Nancy (4:45PM-8PM) needs 105 min.\n- Mark (6:45PM-9PM) needs 90 min.\n- Linda (6:15PM-7:45PM) needs 45 min.\n- Matthew (10:15AM-3:30PM) needs 45 min.\n- Barbara (10AM-7:30PM) needs 90 min.\n\nThe challenge is fitting in as many as possible, considering travel times.\n\nStarting with Karen and David. If we meet Karen first, then David, but after Karen, we can't meet David's full time. Alternatively, maybe meet David in the afternoon. Let's see:\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nStart at Russian Hill 9:00AM.\n\n9:00AM: Go to Karen in Financial District (11 min). Arrive 9:11. Wait until 9:30. Meet Karen 9:30-11:00 (90 min).\n\nThen, travel to Matthew in Haight-Ashbury. Financial District to Haight-Ashbury is 19 minutes. Leave at 11:00, arrive 11:19. Matthew is available until 3:30PM. Meet 11:19-12:04 (45 min).\n\nThen, travel to Barbara in Alamo Square. Haight-Ashbury to Alamo Square is 5 min. Arrive 12:09. Meet Barbara 12:09-13:39 (90 min).\n\nThen, travel to Kevin in Sunset District. Alamo Square to Sunset District is 16 min. Arrive 13:55. Meet Kevin 13:55-15:55 (120 min).\n\nThen travel to Andrew in Nob Hill. Sunset District to Nob Hill is 27 min. Arrive 16:22. Andrew's window ends at 16:45. Need 105 min. 16:22 to 18:07. But Andrew leaves at 16:45. So only 23 minutes available. Not enough. So can't meet Andrew here.\n\nAlternative after Kevin: go to Andrew. Sunset District to Nob Hill is 27 min. If Kevin ends at 15:55, leave at 15:55, arrive 16:22. Andrew's window is until 16:45. So meet from 16:22 to 16:45 (23 min). Not enough. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternative after Barbara, go to Andrew. Barbara ends at 13:39. Alamo Square to Nob Hill is 11 min. Arrive 13:50. Meet Andrew from 13:50 to 15:35 (105 min). That's within his 11:45AM-4:45PM window. Then after Andrew, go to Kevin. Nob Hill to Sunset District is 24 min. Arrive 15:59. Kevin is available until 17:45. Meet from 15:59 to 17:59 (120 min). Then after that, travel to Nancy at Golden Gate Park. Sunset to Golden Gate Park is 11 min. Arrive 18:10. Nancy is available until 20:00. Meet from 18:10 to 19:55 (105 min). Then, travel to Mark in Marina District. Golden Gate Park to Marina is 16 min. Arrive 20:11. But Mark's window is until 21:00. So meet from 20:11 to 21:41 (90 min). But Mark's end time is 21:00, so can only meet until 21:00. That's 49 minutes. Not enough. So need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, after Nancy, go to Mark. Nancy ends at 19:55. Travel to Marina takes 16 min. Arrive 20:11. Meet until 21:00 (49 min) which is less than required 90. So can't meet Mark.\n\nAlternatively, after Kevin, go to Linda. Kevin ends at 17:59. Sunset District to Bayview is 22 min. Arrive 18:21. Linda is available until 19:45. Meet 18:21-19:06 (45 min). Then go to Nancy. Bayview to Golden Gate Park is 22 min. Arrive 19:28. Nancy's window until 20:00. Meet from 19:28-20:00 (32 min). Not enough. Then Mark? From Golden Gate Park to Marina is 16 min. Arrive 20:16. Mark until 21:00. Meet from 20:16-21:00 (44 min). Not enough.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's see if there's a better sequence.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nStart at Russian Hill 9:00.\n\nMeet David first. Travel to Castro (21 min). Arrive 9:21. Meet 9:21-11:21 (120 min).\n\nThen go to Karen. Castro to Financial District (21 min). Arrive 11:42. Karen's window ends at 12:45. So meet 11:42-12:45 (63 min). Not enough. So can't meet Karen. So this is worse. So meeting David first is problematic.\n\nAlternative: Meet Karen first, then David.\n\nKaren: 9:30-11:00. Then to David: 11:00 + 20 min travel (Financial to Castro). Arrive 11:20. Meet 11:20-13:20. Then after that, go to Barbara. Castro to Alamo Square: 8 min. Arrive 13:28. Meet 13:28-14:58. Then to Andrew: Alamo Square to Nob Hill (11 min). Arrive 15:09. Meet 15:09-16:54 (105 min). Then to Nancy: Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park (17 min). Arrive 17:11. Meet 17:11-18:56 (105 min). Then to Mark: Golden Gate Park to Marina (16 min). Arrive 19:12. Meet 19:12-20:42 (90 min), but Mark's end time is 21:00. So possible. Then Linda: Marina to Bayview (27 min). Arrive 20:42 +27=21:09. Linda's window ends at 19:45. So can't meet Linda.\n\nBut in this plan, we meet Karen, David, Barbara, Andrew, Nancy, Mark. That's 6 people. Also, can we fit Matthew?\n\nAfter Karen (ends 11:00), before David? Let's see: After Karen at 11:00, go to Matthew in Haight-Ashbury. Financial District to Haight-Ashbury is 19 min. Arrive 11:19. Meet until 12:04 (45 min). Then to David: Haight-Ashbury to Castro is 6 min. Arrive 12:10. Meet David 12:10-14:10. Then Barbara: Castro to Alamo Square 8 min. Arrive 14:18. Meet 14:18-15:48. Then Andrew: Alamo to Nob Hill 11 min. Arrive 15:59. Meet until 17:44 (105 min). Then Nancy: Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park 17 min. Arrive 18:01. Meet 18:01-19:46 (105 min). Then Mark: Golden Gate to Marina 16 min. Arrive 20:02. Meet 20:02-21:32 (needs 90 min until 21:32, but Mark's window ends at 21:00). So meet 20:02-21:00 (58 min). Not enough. So Mark's meeting is insufficient. Also, no time for Linda.\n\nSo in this case, Matthew is added but Mark can't be met for full duration. So maybe not worth it. Let's count the people met in this scenario: Karen, Matthew, David, Barbara, Andrew, Nancy. That's 6. Plus Mark partially. But the problem says to meet as many friends as possible, but each meeting must meet the minimum time. So partial meetings don't count. So we can't include Mark unless we meet the full 90 min.\n\nAlternative plan: Skip Andrew to fit others.\n\nAfter meeting Barbara (ends 14:58), go to Kevin in Sunset District. Alamo Square to Sunset is 16 min. Arrive 15:14. Meet Kevin 15:14-17:14 (120 min). Then to Nancy: Sunset to Golden Gate Park 11 min. Arrive 17:25. Meet until 19:10 (105 min). Then Mark: Golden Gate to Marina 16 min. Arrive 19:26. Meet 19:26-20:56 (90 min). That's within Mark's window (until 21:00). Then Linda: Marina to Bayview 27 min. Arrive 21:23, which is after her window ends at 19:45. So can't meet Linda.\n\nIn this case, meetings: Karen, David, Barbara, Kevin, Nancy, Mark. 6 people. But what about Andrew? Could we fit him earlier?\n\nAfter Barbara (ends 14:58), go to Andrew: Alamo to Nob Hill 11 min. Meet 15:09-16:54 (105 min). Then Kevin: Nob Hill to Sunset 24 min. Arrive 17:18. Meet until 19:18 (120 min), but Kevin's window ends at 17:45. So only 27 min. Not enough. So not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after Andrew, go to Nancy. Andrew ends 16:54. Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park 17 min. Arrive 17:11. Meet 17:11-18:56. Then Mark: 18:56 +16 min =19:12. Meet until 20:42. Then Linda: Marina to Bayview 27 min. Arrive 20:42 +27=21:09. Too late.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's see another approach.\n\nStart at Russian Hill 9:00AM.\n\nMeet Karen (Financial District) 9:30-11:00.\n\nTravel to Matthew (Haight-Ashbury) 19 min: arrive 11:19, meet 11:19-12:04.\n\nTravel to Barbara (Alamo Square) 5 min: 12:09-13:39.\n\nTravel to David (Castro) 8 min: 13:47-15:47 (120 min). But David's window is until 18:00. So possible.\n\nThen to Kevin (Sunset District): Castro to Sunset is 17 min. Arrive 16:04. Meet 16:04-18:04 (120 min). But Kevin's window ends at 17:45. So only until 17:45. That's 101 minutes. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after David, go to Nancy. Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 min. Arrive 15:58. Meet 15:58-17:43 (105 min). Then to Mark: Golden Gate to Marina 16 min. Arrive 17:59. Meet 17:59-19:29 (90 min). Mark's window starts at 18:45. So 17:59 is too early. So need to adjust.\n\nWait, Mark is available from 6:45PM (18:45). So arriving at 17:59 is too early. Can't meet until 18:45. So Nancy's meeting could end at 17:43, then wait until 18:45 to meet Mark. But that's a lot of waiting time. Alternatively, adjust Nancy's meeting time.\n\nAfter meeting David until 15:47, travel to Golden Gate Park (11 min), arrive 15:58. Meet Nancy from 16:45 (when she's available) to 18:30 (105 min). But that leaves a gap from 15:58 to 16:45. Not efficient. Maybe use that time for someone else.\n\nAlternatively, after David, go to Andrew. Castro to Nob Hill is 16 min. Arrive 16:03. Meet Andrew 16:03-17:48 (105 min). Then to Nancy: Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park 17 min. Arrive 18:05. Meet until 19:50 (105 min). Then to Mark: Golden Gate to Marina 16 min. Arrive 20:06. Meet until 21:36. But Mark's window ends at 21:00. So meet 20:06-21:00 (54 min). Not enough.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to maximize the number of people met with their required times.\n\nPossible viable itinerary:\n\n1. Karen: 9:30-11:00 (Financial District)\n2. Travel to Matthew (11:00-11:19, meet 11:19-12:04)\n3. Travel to Barbara (12:04-12:09, meet 12:09-13:39)\n4. Travel to David (13:39-13:47, meet 13:47-15:47)\n5. Travel to Andrew (15:47-16:03, meet 16:03-17:48)\n6. Travel to Nancy (17:48-18:05, meet 18:05-19:50)\n7. Travel to Mark (19:50-20:06, meet 20:06-21:36) but Mark's window ends at 21:00, so meet 20:06-21:00 (54 min) \u2192 not enough.\n\nSo Mark's meeting is not possible here. Alternative after Nancy, go to Linda. Nancy ends at 19:50. Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 22 min. Arrive 20:12. Linda's window ends at 19:45. Too late.\n\nAlternative: After Andrew (ends 17:48), go to Linda. Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 min. Arrive 18:07. Meet 18:07-18:52 (45 min). Then travel to Nancy: Bayview to Golden Gate Park 22 min. Arrive 19:14. Meet 19:14-20:59. But Nancy's window ends at 20:00. So 19:14-20:00 (46 min). Not enough.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe skip Linda and Mark to fit others.\n\nBut the problem states \"as many friends as possible\". Let's count how many full meetings we can do.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Karen (9:30-11:00)\n- Matthew (11:19-12:04)\n- Barbara (12:09-13:39)\n- David (13:47-15:47)\n- Andrew (16:03-17:48)\n- Nancy (18:05-19:50)\n- Mark (20:06-21:00) \u2192 but only 54 min, so not counted.\n\nTotal: 6 people (Karen, Matthew, Barbara, David, Andrew, Nancy).\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Karen (9:30-11:00)\n- David (11:20-13:20)\n- Barbara (13:28-14:58)\n- Andrew (15:09-16:54)\n- Nancy (17:11-18:56)\n- Mark (19:12-20:42)\nTotal: 6 people (Karen, David, Barbara, Andrew, Nancy, Mark). This works because all meetings meet the required time.\n\nIn this plan:\n\n1. Karen: 9:30-11:00 (Financial)\n2. Travel to David (11:00 +20 min \u2192 arrive 11:20)\n3. David: 11:20-13:20 (Castro)\n4. Travel to Barbara (8 min \u2192 arrive 13:28)\n5. Barbara: 13:28-14:58 (Alamo)\n6. Travel to Andrew (11 min \u2192 arrive 15:09)\n7. Andrew:15:09-16:54 (Nob Hill)\n8. Travel to Nancy (17 min \u2192 arrive 17:11)\n9. Nancy:17:11-18:56 (Golden Gate)\n10. Travel to Mark (16 min \u2192 arrive 19:12)\n11. Mark:19:12-20:42 (Marina)\n\nThis fits all required times. What about Matthew and Kevin? We're missing them here. Can we fit Matthew?\n\nAfter Karen, before David, can we fit Matthew?\n\nKaren ends at 11:00. Travel to Matthew in Haight-Ashbury (19 min \u2192 arrive 11:19). Meet 11:19-12:04 (45 min). Then travel to David (Haight to Castro is 6 min \u2192 arrive 12:10). Meet David 12:10-14:10 (120 min). Then Barbara: Castro to Alamo (8 min \u2192 14:18). Meet 14:18-15:48. Then Andrew: Alamo to Nob Hill (11 min \u2192 15:59). Meet 15:59-17:44. Then Nancy: Nob Hill to Golden Gate (17 min \u2192 18:01). Meet 18:01-19:46. Then Mark: Golden Gate to Marina (16 min \u2192 19:56). Meet 19:56-21:26. But Mark's window ends at 21:00 \u2192 meet 19:56-21:00 (64 min). Not enough.\n\nSo adding Matthew causes Mark's meeting to be short. So better to skip Matthew to include Mark.\n\nThus, the optimal itinerary with 6 people would be Karen, David, Barbara, Andrew, Nancy, Mark. All meeting their required durations.\n\nAnother option: Include Kevin instead of Andrew.\n\nLet's see:\n\nKaren:9:30-11:00.\n\nDavid:11:20-13:20.\n\nBarbara:13:28-14:58.\n\nKevin:15:14-17:14 (Sunset).\n\nNancy:17:25-19:10.\n\nMark:19:26-20:56.\n\nThis also gives 6 people: Karen, David, Barbara, Kevin, Nancy, Mark.\n\nComparing which sequence allows more people. Both options have 6 people. But Andrew's window is earlier, so maybe better to include Andrew and exclude Kevin, but the problem doesn't specify priority. So the user just wants as many as possible.\n\nWait, the problem says \"as many friends as possible\". Let's check if there's a way to fit 7.\n\nPossible to meet Karen, David, Barbara, Andrew, Nancy, Mark, and Linda?\n\nLet's see:\n\nKaren:9:30-11:00.\n\nDavid:11:20-13:20.\n\nBarbara:13:28-14:58.\n\nAndrew:15:09-16:54.\n\nNancy:17:11-18:56.\n\nMark:19:12-20:42.\n\nNow, after Nancy, can we go to Linda? Nancy ends at 18:56. Golden Gate to Bayview is 22 min. Arrive 19:18. Linda is available until 19:45. Meet 19:18-19:45 (27 min). Not enough. So can't include Linda.\n\nAlternatively, after Andrew (ends 16:54), go to Linda. Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 min. Arrive 17:13. Meet 17:13-17:58 (45 min). Then travel to Nancy: Bayview to Golden Gate 22 min. Arrive 18:20. Meet 18:20-20:05 (105 min). But Nancy's window ends at 20:00. So 18:20-20:00 (100 min). Not enough. So can't meet Nancy for full duration.\n\nThus, including Linda would require cutting Nancy's time, which isn't allowed. So maximum seems to be 6.\n\nAnother possibility: Replace Andrew with Kevin.\n\nKaren:9:30-11:00.\n\nDavid:11:20-13:20.\n\nBarbara:13:28-14:58.\n\nKevin:15:14-17:14.\n\nNancy:17:25-19:10.\n\nMark:19:26-20:56.\n\nLinda: After Kevin, go to Linda. Sunset District to Bayview is 22 min. Leave at 17:14, arrive 17:36. Meet 17:36-18:21 (45 min). Then Nancy: Bayview to Golden Gate 22 min. Arrive 18:43. Meet 18:43-20:28 (105 min). But Nancy's window ends at 20:00. So 18:43-20:00 (77 min). Not enough. So can't.\n\nAlternatively, after Kevin, go to Nancy first. Kevin ends at 17:14. Sunset to Golden Gate is 11 min. Arrive 17:25. Meet until 19:10. Then to Mark:19:10+16=19:26. Meet until 20:56. Then Linda:20:56 to Bayview 27 min. Arrive 21:23. Too late.\n\nThus, including Linda isn't possible with this schedule.\n\nSo the best possible is 6 people. Now, which 6? The ones that allow the tightest scheduling.\n\nThe first plan with Karen, David, Barbara, Andrew, Nancy, Mark meets all their time requirements.\n\nAnother plan with Karen, David, Barbara, Kevin, Nancy, Mark also works. Which one has more required time? Both are 6 people. Maybe the first includes Andrew and Mark, the second includes Kevin and Mark. Depending on the travel times.\n\nBut Andrew's required time is 105 min, Kevin's is 120. So if possible, including Kevin might be better in terms of meeting friends with longer requirements, but the count is same.\n\nThe user's goal is to meet as many friends as possible, regardless of the duration as long as minimum is met. So both options are valid. However, in the first plan, Andrew's meeting ends at 16:54, allowing more time for Nancy and Mark. Let's check the first plan again:\n\nItinerary:\n\n1. Karen: 9:30-11:00 (Financial)\n2. David: 11:20-13:20 (Castro)\n3. Barbara:13:28-14:58 (Alamo)\n4. Andrew:15:09-16:54 (Nob Hill)\n5. Nancy:17:11-18:56 (Golden Gate)\n6. Mark:19:12-20:42 (Marina)\n\nTravel times:\n\n- Russian Hill to Financial:11 min (9:00-9:11, wait until 9:30)\n- Financial to Castro:20 min (11:00-11:20)\n- Castro to Alamo:8 min (13:20-13:28)\n- Alamo to Nob Hill:11 min (14:58-15:09)\n- Nob Hill to Golden Gate:17 min (16:54-17:11)\n- Golden Gate to Marina:16 min (18:56-19:12)\n\nAll travel times are accounted for. Each meeting meets the minimum required time.\n\nAnother check: Matthew's slot is 10:15AM-3:30PM, 45 min. Is there a way to include him?\n\nAfter Karen, meet Matthew:\n\nKaren ends at 11:00. Travel to Haight-Ashbury (19 min \u2192 11:19). Meet until 12:04 (45 min). Then to David:6 min \u2192 12:10. Meet until 14:10. Then Barbara:8 min \u219214:18. Meet until 15:48. Then Andrew:11 min \u219215:59. Meet until 17:44. Then Nancy:17 min \u219218:01. Meet until 19:46. Then Mark:16 min \u219219:56. Meet until 21:00 (64 min). Not enough. So can't include Matthew without losing Mark.\n\nThus, maximum is 6 friends.",
