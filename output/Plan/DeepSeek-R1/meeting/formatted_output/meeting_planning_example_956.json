            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible considering travel times and constraints. Let's start by listing all the friends with their locations and available times, along with the minimum meeting durations required.\n\nFirst, I'm starting at The Castro at 9:00 AM. So the earliest possible time to start moving is 9:00. Let's look at the friends in order of their available times to see who I can meet first.\n\nAnthony is at Haight-Ashbury from 7:15 AM to 10:30 AM, needing at least 30 minutes. Since I start at 9:00, the travel time from Castro to Haight-Ashbury is 6 minutes. So leaving at 9:00, arriving at 9:06. Anthony's available until 10:30. If I meet him from 9:06 to 9:36 (30 minutes), that fits. Then I can move to the next person.\n\nNext, Helen is at Pacific Heights from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, needing 75 minutes. From Haight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights is 12 minutes travel. Leaving at 9:36, arrive at 9:48. Helen's available until 12:00 PM. To get 75 minutes, we need to start by 10:45 at the latest (10:45 + 1h15m = 12:00). But starting at 9:48, if I meet until 11:03 (75 minutes), that would work. But wait, the meeting time is 75 minutes, so 9:48 to 11:03. That's 1h15m, which is correct. But let's check if there's a conflict with Joseph, who is in Financial District from 11:15 AM to 1:30 PM, needing 15 minutes. After Helen, I need to get to Financial District. From Pacific Heights to Financial District is 13 minutes. If I leave at 11:03, arrive at 11:16. Joseph's available from 11:15. So maybe start meeting Joseph at 11:16. But he's available until 1:30 PM. 15 minutes would take until 11:31. Then next, Karen is at Marina District from 11:30 AM to 6:30 PM, needing 15 minutes. From Financial District to Marina District is 15 minutes travel. Leaving at 11:31, arrive at 11:46. Karen is available from 11:30, so meet her from 11:46 to 12:01 (15 minutes). Then Brian is at Fisherman's Wharf from 1:45 PM to 8:45 PM, needing 105 minutes. After Karen, what's next? Let's see the timeline so far:\n\n- 9:00-9:06: Travel to Haight-Ashbury\n- 9:06-9:36: Meet Anthony\n- 9:36-9:48: Travel to Pacific Heights\n- 9:48-11:03: Meet Helen (75 min)\n- 11:03-11:16: Travel to Financial District\n- 11:16-11:31: Meet Joseph (15 min)\n- 11:31-11:46: Travel to Marina District\n- 11:46-12:01: Meet Karen (15 min)\n\nNow, after Karen at Marina District, the next available time is 12:01. Brian is at Fisherman's Wharf from 1:45 PM. So there's a gap here. But maybe I can schedule Brian later. Let's see other friends. William is at Alamo Square from 3:15 PM to 5:15 PM, needing 60 minutes. David is at Union Square from 4:45 PM to 7:15 PM, needing 45 minutes. Matthew is at Mission District from 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM, needing 120 minutes. Jeffrey at Golden Gate Park from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM, needing 60 minutes. Joshua at Richmond District all day, but needs 15 minutes.\n\nSo after meeting Karen, the next step is to see if I can meet Brian. But Brian's available from 1:45 PM. Let's check the time after Karen: 12:01 PM. So between 12:01 PM and 1:45 PM, there's 1h44m. Maybe I can meet Joshua in Richmond District here. Let's check the travel time from Marina District to Richmond District. According to the travel matrix, Marina District to Richmond District is 11 minutes. So leaving Marina at 12:01, arrive at 12:12. Joshua is available until 8 PM. So meet him from 12:12 to 12:27 (15 minutes). Then from there, need to get to Fisherman's Wharf for Brian. Richmond District to Fisherman's Wharf is 18 minutes. Leaving at 12:27, arrive at 12:45. But Brian isn't available until 1:45 PM. So there's a wait time here. Alternatively, maybe use this time to meet someone else. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, after Karen at Marina District (12:01), go to Richmond District to meet Joshua (12:12-12:27). Then, from Richmond District, where else? Maybe go to Golden Gate Park, but Jeffrey is only available from 7 PM. Maybe proceed to Fisherman's Wharf but can't meet Brian until 1:45. So from 12:27 to 1:45 PM, that's 1h18m. Maybe that's dead time. Alternatively, adjust the schedule to meet Brian later. Let's see.\n\nBut Brian needs 105 minutes (1h45m). So if we start at 1:45 PM, then end at 3:30 PM. Then, after that, we need to go to Alamo Square for William, who is available from 3:15 PM to 5:15 PM. But if we finish with Brian at 3:30 PM, then travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square is 21 minutes (from Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square is 21 minutes). Arrive at 3:51 PM. William's available until 5:15 PM. So meet from 3:51 to 4:51 (60 minutes). Then after that, need to go to Union Square for David, available from 4:45 PM. Travel from Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 minutes. Leaving at 4:51, arrive at 5:05 PM. David's available until 7:15 PM. Need 45 minutes. So meet from 5:05 to 5:50 PM. Then, next is Matthew at Mission District from 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM, needing 120 minutes. From Union Square to Mission District is 14 minutes. Leaving at 5:50, arrive at 6:04 PM. Meet until 8:04 PM, but Matthew is only available until 7:15 PM. So the latest we can meet is 7:15 PM. So from 6:04 to 7:15 is 1h11m, which is only 71 minutes, less than the required 120. So that's a problem. So Matthew's time is a big constraint here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the order. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Brian at Fisherman's Wharf until 3:30 PM, go to Alamo Square for William (3:51-4:51). Then to Union Square for David (5:05-5:50). Then to Mission District for Matthew. If we arrive at 6:04 PM, but Matthew is available until 7:15 PM. That gives only 1h11m, which isn't enough. So perhaps we need to prioritize Matthew's meeting. Since he needs 120 minutes (2 hours), and is available from 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM. So ideally, we should be there from 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM. But how to fit that in?\n\nIf after Brian, we go straight to Mission District, but that would conflict with William and David. Let's see:\n\nIf Brian is scheduled from 1:45 PM to 3:30 PM (105 minutes). Then travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District. Travel time is 22 minutes. Arrive at 3:52 PM. But Matthew is available only from 5:15 PM. So that's too early. Alternatively, adjust Brian's meeting to a later time so that after Brian, we can go to Matthew.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that Matthew needs 120 minutes and is only available from 5:15 PM. So to meet him, we need to be there from 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM. But other meetings (William and David) are in the same timeframe.\n\nSo perhaps the conflict is between William, David, and Matthew. Let's see their time slots:\n\nWilliam: 3:15 PM -5:15 PM (needs 60 min)\nDavid: 4:45 PM -7:15 PM (45 min)\nMatthew: 5:15 PM -7:15 PM (120 min)\n\nSo if I meet William first, then David, then Matthew, but Matthew's time overlaps. Alternatively, maybe meet David first, but David's window starts at 4:45 PM.\n\nWait, let's think: after Brian (ends at 3:30 PM), travel to Alamo Square (21 min), arrive at 3:51 PM. Meet William until 4:51 PM. Then travel to Union Square (14 min), arrive at 5:05 PM. Meet David until 5:50 PM. Then travel to Mission District (14 min), arrive at 6:04 PM. Meet Matthew until 7:15 PM (71 min), which is not enough. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe skip David to meet Matthew. But David needs 45 min. Alternatively, try to fit David in earlier.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Brian, instead of going to William, go to David first. Let's see:\n\nBrian ends at 3:30 PM. Travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Union Square: 15 min. Arrive at 3:45 PM. But David is available from 4:45 PM. So can't meet him yet. So this doesn't work. Alternatively, after Brian, go to William (3:51-4:51), then David (5:05-5:50), then Matthew. But Matthew's time is insufficient.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the Brian meeting to start later. If Brian is available until 8:45 PM, perhaps start Brian's meeting later to allow more time for others. Let's see:\n\nSuppose after Karen, we go to meet Joshua (as before), then Brian starts later. Let's see:\n\nAfter Karen (12:01 PM), go to Richmond District to meet Joshua (12:12-12:27). Then from there, maybe go to Golden Gate Park? But Jeffrey is only available from 7 PM. Not helpful. Alternatively, go to Pacific Heights? Helen's already met. Or go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Brian. But Brian's available from 1:45 PM. So if we arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 1:45 PM, meet until 3:30 PM. Then proceed to William (3:51-4:51), then David (5:05-5:50), then Matthew (6:04-7:15 PM). Still, Matthew's time is insufficient.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe meet Matthew first in the evening. If we can't meet him for 120 minutes, perhaps it's impossible. But the constraints say we must meet him for 120 minutes. So perhaps we need to prioritize Matthew over others. Let's see:\n\nMatthew is available from 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM. To meet for 120 minutes, we need to be there from 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM. So that's the entire duration. So during that time, can't meet anyone else. So that would mean we have to be at Mission District from 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM. So any other meetings after 5:15 PM are out. But David is at Union Square from 4:45 PM to 7:15 PM, needing 45 minutes. So maybe meet David before 5:15 PM. Let's see:\n\nIf I can meet David from 4:45 PM to 5:30 PM. Then travel to Mission District (14 minutes), arriving at 5:44 PM. But Matthew's available from 5:15 PM, so perhaps start at 5:15 PM. But that overlaps with David's meeting. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, meet David after 7:15 PM, but David's available until 7:15 PM. So no. So perhaps David can't be met if we have to meet Matthew for the full 2 hours. But Matthew is a must. So maybe the only way is to skip David or adjust other meetings.\n\nBut the problem says \"want to meet as many friends as possible\". So if Matthew requires 2 hours, which is a long time, maybe it's better to skip him to meet more friends. But the user's preference is to meet as many as possible, but considering the constraints. However, the problem states \"solve the problem by considering various schedules and pick the best one to optimize your goals\". The goal is to meet as many as possible. But if Matthew's meeting is a constraint (must meet him for 120 minutes), then perhaps we have to include it even if it means missing others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user would prefer to meet more people even if it's not possible to meet Matthew's full 120 minutes. But the problem states \"You'd like to meet Matthew for a minimum of 120 minutes.\" So the minimum is required. So we have to fit that in.\n\nThis complicates things. Let's re-express all the required minimum times:\n\nWilliam: 60 min (3:15-5:15 PM)\nJoshua: 15 min (7:00 AM-8 PM)\nJoseph: 15 min (11:15 AM-1:30 PM)\nDavid: 45 min (4:45 PM-7:15 PM)\nBrian: 105 min (1:45 PM-8:45 PM)\nKaren: 15 min (11:30 AM-6:30 PM)\nAnthony: 30 min (7:15 AM-10:30 AM)\nHelen: 75 min (8 AM-12 PM)\nMatthew: 120 min (5:15 PM-7:15 PM)\nJeffrey: 60 min (7 PM-9:30 PM)\n\nSo the total required times are:\n\nAnthony: 30 min\nHelen: 75 min\nJoseph: 15 min\nKaren: 15 min\nBrian: 105 min\nWilliam: 60 min\nDavid: 45 min\nMatthew: 120 min\nJoshua: 15 min\nJeffrey: 60 min\n\nBut fitting all might not be possible. Let's see if we can find a way.\n\nStarting from 9:00 AM at The Castro.\n\nFirst, meet Anthony in Haight-Ashbury. Travel time 6 min. So 9:00-9:06 travel. Meet 9:06-9:36.\n\nNext, Helen in Pacific Heights. Travel 12 min (Haight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights is 12 min). Arrive 9:48. Meet until 11:03 (75 min).\n\nThen, Joseph in Financial District. Travel time from Pacific Heights to Financial District is 13 min. Arrive 11:16. Meet until 11:31 (15 min).\n\nNext, Karen in Marina District. Travel time 15 min (Financial to Marina). Arrive 11:46. Meet until 12:01 (15 min).\n\nNow, from Marina, maybe go to Richmond District to meet Joshua. Travel 11 min. Arrive 12:12. Meet until 12:27 (15 min).\n\nThen, from Richmond District to Fisherman's Wharf. Travel 18 min. Arrive at 12:45. Brian is available from 1:45 PM. So wait until 1:45 PM. So start meeting Brian at 1:45 PM. Meet until 3:30 PM (105 min).\n\nAfter Brian, travel to Alamo Square for William. Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square is 21 min. Arrive 3:51 PM. Meet William until 4:51 PM (60 min).\n\nThen, go to Union Square for David. Travel time from Alamo Square to Union Square is 14 min. Arrive 5:05 PM. Meet until 5:50 PM (45 min).\n\nNow, need to go to Mission District for Matthew. Travel time from Union Square to Mission District is 14 min. Arrive 6:04 PM. Matthew is available until 7:15 PM. Need to meet until 8:04 PM, but he's only available until 7:15 PM. So meet from 6:04 PM to 7:15 PM (71 min). But that's less than the required 120. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: After meeting Brian until 3:30 PM, travel to Alamo Square (21 min, arrive 3:51 PM), meet William until 4:51 PM. Then travel to Mission District. From Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 min. Arrive at 5:01 PM. But Matthew is available from 5:15 PM. Wait until 5:15 PM. Then meet until 7:15 PM. That's exactly 120 min. So that works. But then David is available from 4:45 PM to 7:15 PM. So can't meet David in this case. So sacrifice David to meet Matthew.\n\nAlternatively, after William, go to David first. But if we meet William until 4:51 PM, travel to Union Square (14 min, arrive 5:05 PM). Meet David until 5:50 PM. Then go to Matthew (arrive 6:04 PM, meet until 7:15 PM: 71 min). Not enough. So either meet David and not meet Matthew fully, or meet Matthew and skip David.\n\nSince Matthew requires 120 min, and David requires 45, perhaps it's better to meet Matthew and skip David. But how many friends can we meet?\n\nIn this scenario, the friends met would be: Anthony, Helen, Joseph, Karen, Joshua, Brian, William, Matthew. That's 8 friends. If we can also meet Jeffrey at Golden Gate Park from 7 PM, but after Matthew, travel to Golden Gate Park. From Mission District to Golden Gate Park is 17 min. So leaving Matthew at 7:15 PM, arrive at 7:32 PM. Jeffrey is available until 9:30 PM. Meet until 8:32 PM (60 min). So that's possible.\n\nSo the schedule would be:\n\n1. Anthony: 9:06-9:36\n2. Helen: 9:48-11:03\n3. Joseph: 11:16-11:31\n4. Karen: 11:46-12:01\n5. Joshua: 12:12-12:27\n6. Brian: 1:45-3:30\n7. William: 3:51-4:51\n8. Matthew: 5:15-7:15\n9. Jeffrey: 7:32-8:32\n\nThat's 9 friends. If David is skipped, but others are met. So that's better.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to fit David in?\n\nAfter Matthew, we can't meet David because David's window ends at 7:15 PM. So after Matthew, go to Jeffrey. So David would have to be met before Matthew. But Matthew starts at 5:15 PM, and requires until 7:15 PM. David's available until 7:15 PM. So if we meet David after Matthew, but that's not possible. So David must be met before 5:15 PM.\n\nIf we try to meet David before Matthew, but after William. For example:\n\nAfter William (4:51 PM), travel to Union Square (14 min, arrive 5:05 PM). Meet David from 5:05 to 5:50 PM. Then go to Mission District (14 min, arrive 6:04 PM). Meet until 7:15 PM (71 min). Not enough. So no.\n\nAlternatively, meet David earlier. Suppose after Brian (3:30 PM), go to Union Square. Travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Union Square is 13 min (from Fisherman's Wharf to Union Square is 13? Wait, looking at the travel times: Fisherman's Wharf to Union Square is 13 minutes? Let me check. The given data for Fisherman's Wharf to Union Square is 13 minutes. So leaving Brian at 3:30 PM, arrive at Union Square at 3:43 PM. But David's available from 4:45 PM. So can't meet yet. So wait until 4:45 PM. Meet from 4:45 to 5:30 PM. Then go to Alamo Square for William. But William is available until 5:15 PM. So this is conflicting. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm. It seems challenging to fit David in if we have to meet Matthew for the full 120 minutes. So perhaps the optimal schedule is to meet Anthony, Helen, Joseph, Karen, Joshua, Brian, William, Matthew, and Jeffrey. That's nine friends. David is the only one not met. But that's better than meeting David and not meeting Matthew.\n\nAlternatively, can we meet David after Matthew? No, because David is available until 7:15 PM, same as Matthew's end time. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: Can we meet David earlier, before meeting William?\n\nAfter Brian ends at 3:30 PM, go to Union Square (13 min, arrive 3:43 PM). But David isn't available until 4:45 PM. So not possible.\n\nAlternatively, adjust Brian's meeting time to end earlier, allowing time to meet David. For example, if Brian is met from 1:45 PM to 3:15 PM (90 minutes), which is less than the required 105. But the problem states minimum of 105 minutes. So we can't do that.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that David can't be met if we need to meet Matthew for the full 120 minutes. Therefore, the optimal schedule includes nine friends, skipping David.\n\nNow, let's check the timeline again:\n\n1. The Castro start at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet Anthony at Haight-Ashbury: 9:06-9:36 AM.\n3. Travel to Pacific Heights (12 min): 9:36-9:48. Meet Helen 9:48-11:03 AM.\n4. Travel to Financial District (13 min): 11:03-11:16 AM. Meet Joseph 11:16-11:31 AM.\n5. Travel to Marina District (15 min): 11:31-11:46 AM. Meet Karen 11:46 AM-12:01 PM.\n6. Travel to Richmond District (11 min): 12:01-12:12 PM. Meet Joshua 12:12-12:27 PM.\n7. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (18 min): 12:27-12:45 PM. Wait until 1:45 PM. Meet Brian 1:45-3:30 PM.\n8. Travel to Alamo Square (21 min): 3:30-3:51 PM. Meet William 3:51-4:51 PM.\n9. Travel to Mission District (10 min from Alamo Square to Mission District): 4:51-5:01 PM. Wait until 5:15 PM. Meet Matthew 5:15-7:15 PM.\n10. Travel to Golden Gate Park (17 min from Mission District to Golden Gate Park): 7:15-7:32 PM. Meet Jeffrey 7:32-8:32 PM.\n\nThis schedule meets all friends except David, but meets the required minimum times. Now, let's verify each meeting's duration and availability:\n\n- Anthony: 9:06-9:36 (30 min) within 7:15 AM-10:30 AM: OK.\n- Helen: 9:48-11:03 (75 min) within 8 AM-12 PM: OK.\n- Joseph: 11:16-11:31 (15 min) within 11:15 AM-1:30 PM: OK.\n- Karen: 11:46-12:01 (15 min) within 11:30 AM-6:30 PM: OK.\n- Joshua: 12:12-12:27 (15 min) within 7:00 AM-8:00 PM: OK.\n- Brian: 1:45-3:30 (105 min) within 1:45 PM-8:45 PM: OK.\n- William: 3:51-4:51 (60 min) within 3:15 PM-5:15 PM: OK.\n- Matthew: 5:15-7:15 (120 min) within 5:15 PM-7:15 PM: OK.\n- Jeffrey: 7:32-8:32 (60 min) within 7:00 PM-9:30 PM: OK.\n\nAll constraints are met except David. But since meeting David would require sacrificing Matthew's required time, which is not possible, this seems to be the optimal schedule meeting nine friends.",
