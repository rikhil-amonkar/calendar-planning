            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and the constraints each person has. Let's start by listing all the friends and their availability along with the required meeting durations.\n\nFirst, the arrival time is at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. So, the day starts there. Let's see the friends:\n\n1. **Stephanie** at Mission District from 8:15 AM to 1:45 PM. Needs 90 minutes. Since we arrive at 9 AM, maybe the first meeting could be with her. But we need to check the travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Mission District, which is 11 minutes. So leaving at 9 AM, arrival at 9:11 AM. Stephanie is available until 1:45 PM. We need 90 minutes. So the meeting could start at 9:11 AM and end at 10:41 AM. But wait, Stephanie's time starts at 8:15 AM, so that's feasible. But we have to make sure that the meeting ends before 1:45 PM. 9:11 AM + 90 minutes is 10:41 AM, which is well within her window. Then after that, we can move to another location.\n\n2. **Richard** at Pacific Heights from 7:15 AM to 10:15 AM. Needs 75 minutes. But our earliest possible arrival there would be after meeting Stephanie. Wait, Richard's window ends at 10:15 AM. If we finish with Stephanie at 10:41 AM, that's too late for Richard. So maybe we need to meet Richard first? But we start at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. The travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights is 12 minutes. So leaving at 9 AM, arrive at 9:12 AM. Then meet Richard from 9:12 AM to 10:27 AM (75 minutes). That fits because Richard's window ends at 10:15 AM. Wait, 10:27 AM is after 10:15 AM. That's a problem. So the latest we can start meeting Richard is 9:00 AM (arrival at 9:12 AM) but his window ends at 10:15 AM. So the maximum time we can spend is from 9:12 AM to 10:15 AM. That's 63 minutes, which is less than the required 75. So meeting Richard might not be possible unless we adjust something. Hmm. So maybe Richard is not feasible. Wait, the required minimum is 75 minutes. His window is 7:15 AM to 10:15 AM. We arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. The earliest we can get to Pacific Heights is 9:12 AM. From 9:12 AM to 10:15 AM is 63 minutes. Not enough. So maybe Richard can't be met. That's a problem. So perhaps we have to skip Richard. But let's check again. The travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights is 12 minutes. So departure at 9:00 AM, arrive 9:12 AM. The available time with Richard is 9:12 AM to 10:15 AM (63 minutes). Needs 75, so not possible. So Richard is out. So we have to skip him. So that's one friend we can't meet. Let's note that.\n\n3. **Brian** at Russian Hill from 12:15 PM to 4:00 PM. Needs 120 minutes. That's two hours. So ideally, we can schedule a long meeting here. But need to fit it in with others.\n\n4. **Sandra** at Bayview from 1:00 PM to 7:30 PM. Needs 15 minutes. Short meeting, so maybe after others.\n\n5. **Jason** at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:30 AM to 5:45 PM. Needs 60 minutes. So he's available all day, so maybe the last meeting? Or somewhere in between.\n\nNow, let's see the possible order. Starting at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM.\n\nOption 1: Meet Stephanie first. From Haight-Ashbury to Mission District (11 minutes). Arrive at 9:11 AM. Meet until 10:41 AM (90 minutes). Then, next meeting. Where to next? Let's see the options.\n\nAfter Stephanie at Mission District, possible next meetings:\n\n- Brian at Russian Hill (available 12:15 PM onwards). So maybe after Stephanie, we can go to another location. Let's check the travel times from Mission District. For example, Mission District to Russian Hill is 15 minutes. So leaving Mission District at 10:41 AM, arrive at Russian Hill at 10:56 AM. But Brian's window starts at 12:15 PM. So there's a gap. Alternatively, maybe we can go to another person in between. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after Stephanie, maybe go to meet Jason at Fisherman's Wharf. Travel time from Mission District to Fisherman's Wharf is 22 minutes. Leaving at 10:41 AM, arrive at 11:03 AM. Meet Jason for 60 minutes until 12:03 PM. Then, from Fisherman's Wharf to Russian Hill is 7 minutes (since Fisherman's Wharf to Russian Hill is 7 minutes). So arrive at 12:10 PM. But Brian's available at 12:15 PM. So wait until 12:15 PM, then meet Brian from 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM (120 minutes). Then after that, go to Sandra at Bayview. Let's check the travel time from Russian Hill to Bayview. That's 23 minutes. So leaving at 2:15 PM, arrive at 2:38 PM. Sandra is available from 1 PM to 7:30 PM. So meet Sandra from 2:38 PM to 2:53 PM (15 minutes). Then, maybe head back to Fisherman's Wharf or others, but Jason is already met. So total meetings: Stephanie, Jason, Brian, Sandra. That's four friends. But what about Richard? Not possible. And is that the maximum possible?\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Stephanie, perhaps go to Brian first. Let's see. After Stephanie ends at 10:41 AM, go to Russian Hill. Travel time 15 minutes. Arrive at 10:56 AM. But Brian's window starts at 12:15 PM. So that's a 1 hour 19 minutes wait. Not efficient. So perhaps better to do something else in that time.\n\nAlternatively, after Stephanie, go to Jason. So Mission District to Fisherman's Wharf (22 minutes). Arrive at 11:03 AM. Meet until 12:03 PM. Then from Fisherman's Wharf to Russian Hill (7 minutes), arrive at 12:10 PM. Wait until 12:15 PM, then meet Brian until 2:15 PM. Then from Russian Hill to Bayview (23 minutes), arrive 2:38 PM, meet Sandra until 2:53 PM. Then, is there time left for another meeting? Let's check if we can meet anyone else. Jason is already met. Richard can't be met. Stephanie's time ends at 1:45 PM. So maybe not. So total four friends.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to fit in another friend?\n\nWait, after meeting Brian until 2:15 PM, we go to Bayview (23 minutes), meet Sandra. Then, after that, could we go to Pacific Heights or somewhere else? Let's see. Sandra's meeting ends at 2:53 PM. Let's check if there's anyone else available. Jason is available until 5:45 PM. But already met him. Richard's time ends at 10:15 AM. So no. So only four friends possible.\n\nAlternatively, can we meet Brian for a shorter time to fit in another meeting? But Brian requires 120 minutes. That's the minimum. So we can't reduce that.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe meet Jason first? Let's see. Starting at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf takes 23 minutes. Arrive at 9:23 AM. Meet Jason for 60 minutes until 10:23 AM. Then, from Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District (22 minutes), arrive at 10:45 AM. Stephanie is available until 1:45 PM. Need 90 minutes. So meet from 10:45 AM to 12:15 PM. Then, from Mission District to Russian Hill (15 minutes). Arrive at 12:30 PM. Brian is available from 12:15 PM. So start meeting at 12:30 PM until 2:30 PM (120 minutes). Then, from Russian Hill to Bayview (23 minutes), arrive 2:53 PM, meet Sandra until 3:08 PM. Then, can we meet anyone else? Richard's window is closed. So again four friends.\n\nSame number. But Stephanie's meeting ends at 12:15 PM, which is within her availability (until 1:45 PM). So that's feasible.\n\nBut in this case, Stephanie's meeting is from 10:45 AM to 12:15 PM. Which fits her window. So that works. Then Brian from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM. Sandra from 2:53 PM to 3:08 PM. Jason already met. So total four friends.\n\nAnother option: Meet Stephanie first, then Brian, then Jason, then Sandra. Let's see. Starting at 9:00 AM. Haight-Ashbury to Mission District (11 min) arrive 9:11 AM. Meet until 10:41 AM. Then to Russian Hill (15 min), arrive 10:56 AM. But Brian's window starts at 12:15 PM. So have to wait until then. So from 10:56 AM to 12:15 PM, that's 1h19m. Not ideal. Then meet Brian from 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM. Then to Fisherman's Wharf (7 min), arrive 2:22 PM. Meet Jason until 3:22 PM. Then to Bayview (26 min from Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview). Arrive 3:48 PM. Meet Sandra until 4:03 PM. This way, we meet Stephanie, Brian, Jason, Sandra. Same four friends. But the order may vary.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Stephanie, go to Bayview. But Sandra's window starts at 1 PM. So if we finish Stephanie at 10:41 AM, travel to Bayview from Mission District takes 15 minutes. Arrive at 10:56 AM. But Sandra isn't available until 1 PM. So that's a long wait. Not efficient.\n\nHmm. So the maximum seems to be four friends. Let's see if there's a way to meet five. But the constraints are tight. Let's check again.\n\nWait, maybe after meeting Brian, we can go meet Sandra, then Jason again? But Jason's meeting requires 60 minutes. But we already met him once. But the problem says \"you'd like to meet as many friends as possible\". So meeting Jason once is enough. So same with others. So five friends is impossible because Richard can't be met. So the maximum is four.\n\nNow, which four? Stephanie, Brian, Sandra, Jason. Or Stephanie, Brian, Jason, Sandra. Or other combinations.\n\nWait, let's check another approach. Suppose we start with Richard. But as earlier analysis shows, we can't meet him because his time ends at 10:15 AM and we can't meet for the required 75 minutes. So he's out.\n\nSo the possible friends are Stephanie, Brian, Sandra, Jason. Four.\n\nNow, the key is to arrange the meetings in a way that the travel times and overlaps are minimized.\n\nOption 1:\n\nStart with Stephanie:\n\n9:00 AM arrive Haight-Ashbury.\n\n9:00 AM depart, 11 min to Mission District, arrive 9:11 AM.\n\nMeet Stephanie from 9:11 AM to 10:41 AM (90 min).\n\nThen, from Mission District to Fisherman's Wharf (22 min). Depart 10:41 AM, arrive 11:03 AM.\n\nMeet Jason from 11:03 AM to 12:03 PM (60 min).\n\nThen, from Fisherman's Wharf to Russian Hill (7 min). Depart 12:03 PM, arrive 12:10 PM. Wait until 12:15 PM.\n\nMeet Brian from 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM (120 min).\n\nThen, from Russian Hill to Bayview (23 min). Depart 2:15 PM, arrive 2:38 PM.\n\nMeet Sandra from 2:38 PM to 2:53 PM (15 min).\n\nThis works. So four friends.\n\nAnother option: After Brian, could we meet someone else? Let's see. Brian ends at 2:15 PM. Then to Bayview (23 min), arrive 2:38 PM. Sandra until 2:53 PM. Then, from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 min (Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25). Arrive at 3:18 PM. Meet Jason again? But we've already met him once, and the problem says \"meet as many friends as possible\", so each friend once counts. So no gain there.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Sandra, could we go back to Fisherman's Wharf? But Jason's already met. So no.\n\nSo the best itinerary is Stephanie, Jason, Brian, Sandra. Four friends.\n\nAnother possibility: What if after meeting Stephanie, go to Brian earlier, but that requires waiting. For example:\n\nStephanie ends at 10:41 AM. Travel to Russian Hill (15 min) arrive 10:56 AM. Brian's window starts at 12:15 PM. So wait 1h19m. Then meet Brian from 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM. Then from Russian Hill to Fisherman's Wharf (7 min) arrive 2:22 PM. Meet Jason until 3:22 PM. Then to Bayview (26 min from Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview). Arrive 3:48 PM. Meet Sandra until 4:03 PM. Same four friends but with more waiting time. The first option (Stephanie, Jason, Brian, Sandra) has less waiting.\n\nSo the first option is better. Let's verify the times.\n\nStephanie: 9:11 AM to 10:41 AM (90 min).\n\nJason: 11:03 AM to 12:03 PM (60 min).\n\nBrian: 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM (120 min).\n\nSandra: 2:38 PM to 2:53 PM (15 min).\n\nAll within their available times.\n\nCheck travel times:\n\n- Mission District to Fisherman's Wharf: 22 min. Correct.\n\n- Fisherman's Wharf to Russian Hill: 7 min. Correct.\n\n- Russian Hill to Bayview: 23 min. Correct.\n\nNow, between Stephanie and Jason: Depart Mission District at 10:41 AM, arrive Fisherman's Wharf at 11:03 AM. That's 22 minutes. Correct.\n\nBetween Jason and Brian: Depart Fisherman's Wharf at 12:03 PM, arrive Russian Hill at 12:10 PM. Wait until 12:15 PM. That's okay.\n\nBetween Brian and Sandra: Depart Russian Hill at 2:15 PM, arrive Bayview at 2:38 PM. Meet until 2:53 PM.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied.\n\nThus, the optimal schedule includes four friends: Stephanie, Jason, Brian, and Sandra. Richard can't be met due to time constraints.",
