            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule meetings with as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering the travel times and constraints. Let's start by listing all the people and their availability.\n\nFirst, I arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. Let's check who's available when.\n\nDavid is at Embarcadero from 8:15 AM to 9:00 AM. Wait, I arrive at 9:00 AM, but David's window ends at 9:00 AM. So maybe I can't meet David because by the time I get there, he's already left. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Embarcadero is 25 minutes. So leaving at 9:00 AM, I'd arrive at 9:25 AM, but David is only there until 9:00 AM. So David is out. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe David isn't possible. Let's note that.\n\nNext, Barbara is at Financial District from 10:30 AM to 4:30 PM. Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf from 8 AM to 5:30 PM. Kevin at Mission District 11:15 AM to 3:15 PM. Jeffrey at Bayview from 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM.\n\nSo the people we can potentially meet are Joseph, Barbara, Kevin, Jeffrey. David seems impossible because his time ends at 9:00 AM, and I can't reach Embarcadero in time.\n\nStarting at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. Let's see the earliest possible meetings.\n\nFirst, maybe meet Barbara at Financial District. But Barbara starts at 10:30 AM. Let's calculate travel time from Golden Gate Park to Financial District: 26 minutes. So leaving at 9:00, arrive at 9:26. But Barbara isn't there until 10:30. So maybe wait until 10:30. But maybe there's another person to meet first.\n\nAlternatively, meet Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf. Joseph is available all day. But the earliest possible time. Travel from Golden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf is 24 minutes. So leaving at 9:00, arrive at 9:24. Then meet Joseph. But we need 90 minutes with him. Let's see: if we start at 9:24, end at 10:54. Then next meeting.\n\nAfter that, maybe go to Kevin at Mission District. Kevin is available from 11:15 AM. Let's check the time. If we leave Fisherman's Wharf at 10:54, travel time to Mission District is 22 minutes. Arrive at 11:16 AM. But Kevin is available from 11:15. That's close. But maybe the meeting can start at 11:16. However, Kevin's availability ends at 3:15 PM. So we can meet him for 30 minutes, ending at 11:46 AM. Then next.\n\nThen maybe go to Barbara at Financial District. From Mission District to Financial District is 17 minutes. Leaving at 11:46, arrive at 12:03. Meet Barbara for at least 15 minutes. Let's say 12:03 to 12:18. Then after that, what's next? Then maybe go to Jeffrey at Bayview, but Jeffrey is only available from 5:30 PM. Let's see the time between. Maybe there's a gap here. Alternatively, maybe meet Joseph again later? But Joseph is available until 5:30 PM. Wait, but we already met Joseph once. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible. So each person once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Barbara, go to Embarcadero or somewhere else? But no other people are available except Jeffrey later.\n\nWait, but Jeffrey's meeting is in the evening. Let's check the timeline:\n\nStarting with Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:24 to 10:54. Then to Kevin at Mission District from 11:16 to 11:46. Then to Barbara at Financial District from 12:03 to 12:18. Then there's a lot of time until 5:30 PM. Maybe we can fit another meeting? Wait, but we already met Barbara, Joseph, Kevin. The remaining is Jeffrey. But Jeffrey's time starts at 5:30 PM. Let's see the travel from Financial District to Bayview is 19 minutes. If we leave Financial District at, say, 4:30 PM (Barbara's end time), we can arrive at Bayview at 4:49 PM. But Jeffrey is not there until 5:30 PM. So we have to wait. So maybe leave Financial District later. But Barbara is available until 4:30 PM. Let's see.\n\nWait, Barbara is available until 4:30 PM. So if we stay with Barbara until 4:30, leave then. Travel time to Bayview is 19 minutes, arriving at 4:49 PM. Then wait until 5:30 PM to meet Jeffrey. Then meet Jeffrey for 60 minutes until 6:30 PM. That works. So the schedule would be:\n\n9:00 AM - Start at Golden Gate Park.\n\n9:24 AM - Meet Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf until 10:54 AM.\n\nThen travel to Mission District (22 mins) arrive 11:16 AM. Meet Kevin until 11:46 AM.\n\nThen travel to Financial District (17 mins) arrive 12:03 PM. Meet Barbara until 4:30 PM (since she's available until then). Wait, but the minimum is 15 minutes. So maybe meet Barbara for 15 minutes, from 12:03 to 12:18 PM. Then have free time until 4:30 PM. But that's a lot of time. Alternatively, extend Barbara's meeting to longer? But the minimum is 15. Maybe meet longer if possible. But maybe it's better to meet Barbara later to allow for other meetings.\n\nAlternatively, after Kevin, go to another location. Wait, but there's no other people available between 12:18 PM and 4:30 PM. So maybe Barbara's meeting can be longer. Let's see. Let's adjust the schedule.\n\nAlternatively, after Kevin, go to Barbara for 15 minutes, then have free time, then maybe go to Joseph again? But Joseph is available all day. But since we already met him once, perhaps we don't need to meet him again. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible. So we can meet Joseph once, Barbara once, Kevin once, and Jeffrey once. That's four meetings. But David is impossible. So four is the maximum possible.\n\nBut let's see if the schedule can fit all four.\n\nWait, after meeting Barbara, the next meeting is Jeffrey at Bayview starting at 5:30 PM. Let's calculate the travel from Financial District to Bayview is 19 minutes. So if Barbara's meeting ends at 4:30 PM, leave at 4:30, arrive at Bayview at 4:49 PM. Then wait until 5:30 PM. Then meet Jeffrey from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM. That's possible.\n\nBut wait, Barbara's availability is until 4:30 PM. So the latest we can meet her is until 4:30 PM. So if we meet Barbara from, say, 4:15 PM to 4:30 PM (15 minutes), that would work. Then travel to Bayview, arrive at 4:30 +19=4:49. Then wait until 5:30 PM. But that leaves a lot of time in between. Alternatively, perhaps schedule Barbara earlier so that we can do other things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Barbara earlier in the day. Let's adjust the initial plan.\n\nStarting at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. Let's first meet David? Wait, David is at Embarcadero from 8:15 AM to 9:00 AM. I arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM, so even if I could leave immediately, it's 25 minutes to Embarcadero. Arrival at 9:25 AM, but David is gone by 9:00 AM. So impossible. So David is out.\n\nSo the initial schedule could be:\n\n1. Golden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24 mins. Arrive 9:24. Meet Joseph from 9:24 to 10:54 (90 mins).\n\n2. Then to Mission District: 22 mins. Arrive 11:16. Meet Kevin from 11:16 to 11:46 (30 mins).\n\n3. Then to Financial District: 17 mins. Arrive 12:03. Meet Barbara from 12:03 to 12:18 (15 mins). Then have free time until 4:30 PM.\n\n4. Stay with Barbara until 4:30 PM? Wait, Barbara is available until 4:30 PM. If we extend the meeting with Barbara longer, say from 12:03 PM to 4:30 PM, that's 4h27m, which is way over the minimum 15 mins. But maybe that's allowed. But the problem says \"minimum\", so meeting longer is okay. But the goal is to meet as many friends as possible. So perhaps the optimal schedule would be to meet Barbara for the minimum 15 mins, then use the remaining time to maybe do something else. But there's no other friends available during that time. So perhaps we can stay with Barbara until her time ends, then go to Jeffrey.\n\nWait, if we meet Barbara from 12:03 PM to 4:30 PM (4h27m), that's possible. Then leave Financial District at 4:30 PM, travel to Bayview (19 mins), arrive 4:49 PM. Wait until 5:30 PM, then meet Jeffrey from 5:30 to 6:30 PM. That would work.\n\nBut this way, we meet Joseph, Kevin, Barbara, and Jeffrey. Four meetings, which seems to be the maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Kevin, go to Embarcadero? But no one is there except David, who's already unavailable. So no.\n\nWait, let's check the timeline again:\n\n- 9:00 AM arrive at Golden Gate Park.\n\n- Meet Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf 9:24-10:54.\n\n- Travel to Mission District (22 mins) arrive 11:16. Meet Kevin 11:16-11:46.\n\n- Then travel to Financial District (17 mins) arrive 12:03. Meet Barbara from 12:03 to 4:30 PM (her end time).\n\n- Then leave Financial District at 4:30 PM, travel to Bayview (19 mins) arrive 4:49. Wait until 5:30 PM.\n\n- Meet Jeffrey from 5:30-6:30 PM.\n\nThat's four meetings. So this is possible.\n\nBut the problem is that Barbara's meeting is from 12:03 to 4:30 PM. But the minimum required is 15 minutes, so this is okay. It's allowed to meet longer. So this schedule meets Joseph, Kevin, Barbara, Jeffrey. All four. David is impossible. So that's four friends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Kevin, go somewhere else. But I don't think there's anyone else available. Let's confirm:\n\nAfter Kevin at Mission District, which ends at 11:46 AM. Let's see Barbara is available from 10:30 AM to 4:30 PM. So after Kevin, meeting Barbara is possible. Alternatively, after Kevin, could we go to Joseph again? But Joseph's meeting is already done. The goal is to meet each friend once. So the maximum is four friends.\n\nThus, the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf 9:24-10:54.\n\n2. Travel to Mission District (22 mins) arriving 11:16, meet Kevin until 11:46.\n\n3. Travel to Financial District (17 mins) arrive 12:03, meet Barbara until 4:30 PM.\n\n4. Travel to Bayview (19 mins) arrive 4:49, wait until 5:30 PM, meet Jeffrey until 6:30 PM.\n\nThis meets all four friends. Let's check if the travel times are correctly calculated.\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District: 22 minutes. So departure at 10:54 AM, arrival 11:16 AM. That's correct.\n\nMission District to Financial District: 17 minutes. Depart 11:46 AM, arrive 12:03 PM. Correct.\n\nFinancial District to Bayview: 19 minutes. Depart 4:30 PM, arrive 4:49 PM. Then wait until 5:30 PM. Jeffrey's time starts at 5:30 PM. Meet for 60 minutes until 6:30 PM.\n\nAll constraints are met. Let's check each person's availability:\n\n- Joseph: available 8 AM to 5:30 PM. Meeting 9:24-10:54 is within his window.\n\n- Kevin: available 11:15 AM to 3:15 PM. Meeting 11:16-11:46 is within his time.\n\n- Barbara: available 10:30 AM to 4:30 PM. Meeting 12:03-4:30 PM is within her window.\n\n- Jeffrey: available 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM. Meeting 5:30-6:30 PM is within his time.\n\nAll minimum durations are met. The only question is whether the travel times are correctly calculated. Let's confirm each leg:\n\n1. Golden Gate Park to Fisherman's Wharf: 24 minutes. 9:00 AM departure, arrive 9:24 AM. Correct.\n\n2. Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District: 22 minutes. Depart 10:54 AM, arrive 11:16 AM. Correct.\n\n3. Mission District to Financial District: 17 minutes. Depart 11:46 AM, arrive 12:03 PM. Correct.\n\n4. Financial District to Bayview: 19 minutes. Depart 4:30 PM, arrive 4:49 PM. Then wait until 5:30 PM.\n\nYes, all correct. This schedule fits all the constraints and meets four friends. So this should be the optimal solution.",
