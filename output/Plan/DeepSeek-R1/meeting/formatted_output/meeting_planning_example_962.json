            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to schedule all these meetings. The user is starting at The Castro at 9:00 AM and wants to meet as many friends as possible, considering travel times and constraints. Let me go through each person's availability and minimum time required.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the friends with their locations, available times, and required minimum durations:\n\n1. **Elizabeth**: Marina District, 7:00 PM\u20138:45 PM (105 minutes needed)\n2. **Joshua**: Presidio, 8:30 AM\u20131:15 PM (105 min)\n3. **Timothy**: North Beach, 7:45 PM\u201310:00 PM (90 min)\n4. **David**: Embarcadero, 10:45 AM\u201312:30 PM (30 min)\n5. **Kimberly**: Haight-Ashbury, 4:45 PM\u20139:30 PM (75 min)\n6. **Lisa**: Golden Gate Park, 5:30 PM\u20139:45 PM (45 min)\n7. **Ronald**: Richmond District, 8:00 AM\u20139:30 AM (90 min)\n8. **Stephanie**: Alamo Square, 3:30 PM\u20134:30 PM (30 min)\n9. **Helen**: Financial District, 5:30 PM\u20136:30 PM (45 min)\n10. **Laura**: Sunset District, 5:45 PM\u20139:15 PM (90 min)\n\nBut the user starts at The Castro at 9:00 AM. Let's see who is available early. Ronald is available from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM, but the user arrives at 9:00 AM. So Ronald's window is 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, but the user needs to meet him for 90 minutes. That's impossible because Ronald's available only until 9:30 AM. So Ronald can't be met. So we have to skip Ronald.\n\nNext, Joshua is at Presidio from 8:30 AM to 1:15 PM. The user arrives at 9:00 AM. So the available time for Joshua is 9:00 AM to 1:15 PM. Need 105 minutes (1h45m). Let's see when to schedule that. Let's start at 9:00 AM. But traveling from The Castro to Presidio takes 20 minutes (from the travel times). Wait, no. Wait, the user starts at The Castro at 9:00 AM. So if they leave immediately, arrival at Presidio is 9:00 + 20 min = 9:20 AM. Then they can meet Joshua from 9:20 AM until his end time at 1:15 PM. The duration from 9:20 AM to 1:15 PM is 3h55m, which is 235 minutes. But the required is 105. So possible. But maybe can fit that in. Let's tentatively plan to meet Joshua from 9:20 AM to 11:05 AM (105 minutes). Then after that, what's next?\n\nAfter Joshua, maybe go to David at Embarcadero. David is available from 10:45 AM to 12:30 PM. But if the user is meeting Joshua until 11:05 AM, they need to travel to Embarcadero. From Presidio to Embarcadero is 20 minutes (Presidio to Embarcadero is 20 min according to the travel times). Wait, looking at the travel times: Presidio to Embarcadero is 20 minutes. So leaving Presidio at 11:05, arrive at 11:25 AM. David's available until 12:30 PM. So the user can meet David from 11:25 to 11:55 (30 minutes) to fulfill the 30-minute requirement. That works.\n\nThen after David, where next? Let's check other people. Stephanie is at Alamo Square from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. So maybe after David, there's some time. Let's see. After meeting David until 11:55 AM, what's next? Maybe go to someone else. Let's see the other options. Kimberly at Haight-Ashbury from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM (75 min needed). Lisa at Golden Gate Park from 5:30 PM (45 min). Helen at Financial District 5:30 PM\u20136:30 PM (45 min). Laura at Sunset District from 5:45 PM (90 min). Elizabeth at Marina District from 7 PM (105 min). Timothy at North Beach from 7:45 PM (90 min).\n\nSo after David, the user has from 11:55 AM to 3:30 PM (Stephanie's window) as free time. Maybe can meet others in between? Let's check. Are there any other people available in that time? Let me check:\n\n- Kimberly: 4:45 PM onwards. So after 4:45 PM.\n- Lisa: 5:30 PM onwards.\n- Helen: 5:30\u20136:30 PM.\n- Laura: 5:45 PM onwards.\n- Elizabeth: 7 PM onwards.\n- Timothy: 7:45 PM onwards.\n\nSo between 11:55 AM and 3:30 PM, there's a gap. Maybe have lunch or other activities, but the user wants to meet as many as possible, so maybe there's someone else. But looking at the constraints, the other people are only available later. So perhaps that's a gap. But let's proceed.\n\nNext, Stephanie at Alamo Square from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. Need 30 minutes. So the user needs to arrive by 4:00 PM to meet her for 30 minutes. Travel time from Embarcadero to Alamo Square: Let's check. Embarcadero to Alamo Square is 19 minutes? Wait, looking at the travel times: Embarcadero to Alamo Square is 19 minutes. So if the user leaves Embarcadero at 11:55 AM, but that's way too early. Wait, no. After David at Embarcadero ends at 11:55 AM, the next meeting is Stephanie at Alamo Square starting at 3:30 PM. So there's a big gap. But maybe the user can meet someone else in between. But according to the constraints, there's no one else available in that time. So perhaps the user has to wait until 3:30 PM for Stephanie. Wait, but that's a long time. Maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, after meeting David until 11:55 AM, the user has until 3:30 PM (when Stephanie is available) free. But is there anyone else available during that time? Let's check all friends again.\n\nLooking at all friends:\n\n- Ronald: 8:00\u20139:30 AM (already impossible)\n- Joshua: until 1:15 PM (met from 9:20\u201311:05)\n- David: until 12:30 PM (met until 11:55)\n- Stephanie: 3:30\u20134:30 PM\n- Kimberly: 4:45 PM onwards\n- Lisa: 5:30 PM onwards\n- Helen: 5:30\u20136:30 PM\n- Laura: 5:45 PM onwards\n- Elizabeth: 7 PM onwards\n- Timothy: 7:45 PM onwards\n\nSo between 11:55 AM and 3:30 PM, there's no one available. So maybe the user can't meet anyone during that time. So perhaps the itinerary would be:\n\n9:00 AM leave Castro, arrive Presidio 9:20, meet Joshua 9:20\u201311:05 (105 min)\nThen travel to Embarcadero (20 min), arrive 11:25, meet David 11:25\u201311:55 (30 min)\nThen maybe have a break until 3:30 PM for Stephanie.\n\nBut how to get to Stephanie at Alamo Square by 3:30 PM. Let's check the travel time from Embarcadero to Alamo Square. It's 19 minutes. So if the user leaves at, say, 3:11 PM, arrives at 3:30 PM. But Stephanie's window is 3:30\u20134:30 PM. So the user can meet Stephanie from 3:30\u20134:00 PM (30 min). Then after that, travel to next location.\n\nAfter Stephanie (ends 4:00 PM), next is Kimberly at Haight-Ashbury, available from 4:45 PM. So need to see travel time from Alamo Square to Haight-Ashbury. The travel time is 5 minutes (Alamo Square to Haight-Ashbury is 5 min). So leaving at 4:00 PM, arrive at 4:05 PM. But Kimberly is available from 4:45 PM. So there's a 40-minute gap. Wait, that's not good. Alternatively, maybe adjust the time with Stephanie.\n\nWait, maybe meet Stephanie from 3:30\u20134:00 PM, then leave Alamo Square at 4:00 PM. Then go to Haight-Ashbury (5 min), arrive 4:05 PM. But Kimberly isn't available until 4:45 PM. So that's a 40-minute wait. Hmm. Maybe can't meet Kimberly until 4:45 PM. So perhaps the user can't start meeting Kimberly until 4:45 PM. Then Kimberly needs 75 minutes, so until 6:00 PM. But then after that, there's Lisa at Golden Gate Park (needs 45 min starting at 5:30 PM), but if Kimberly's meeting goes until 6:00 PM, that conflicts. Wait, Lisa is available from 5:30 PM to 9:45 PM, needs 45 minutes. If Kimberly is met from 4:45\u20136:00 PM (75 min), then Lisa can be met after that. Let's check travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Golden Gate Park: 7 minutes. So leave Haight-Ashbury at 6:00 PM, arrive Golden Gate Park at 6:07 PM. Meet Lisa from 6:07\u20136:52 PM (45 min). That's within Lisa's availability (until 9:45 PM). Then after that, the user needs to meet Helen at Financial District from 5:30\u20136:30 PM. Wait, but Helen's window is 5:30\u20136:30 PM, so if the user is meeting Lisa until 6:52 PM, they can't meet Helen. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Helen first. Let's see. After Stephanie (ends 4:00 PM), travel to Financial District. Alamo Square to Financial District is 17 minutes. So leaving at 4:00 PM, arrive at 4:17 PM. But Helen is available from 5:30 PM. So again, there's a gap. Not possible. So maybe Helen's meeting has to be after Lisa. But Helen's window ends at 6:30 PM. So if Lisa's meeting ends at 6:52 PM, can't meet Helen. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the order. Let's think again. After meeting Stephanie at Alamo Square until 4:00 PM, maybe go to Helen first. But Helen is at Financial District from 5:30 PM. So if the user goes from Alamo Square to Financial District (17 min), arriving at 4:17 PM. But Helen isn't available until 5:30 PM. So that's over an hour wait. Not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, after Stephanie, go to Kimberly at Haight-Ashbury starting at 4:45 PM. So leave Alamo Square at 4:00 PM, arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 4:05 PM. Wait until 4:45 PM, then meet Kimberly from 4:45\u20136:00 PM (75 min). Then travel to Golden Gate Park (7 min) to meet Lisa from 6:07\u20136:52 PM. Then after that, need to check if there's time for Helen. But Helen's window ends at 6:30 PM. So Lisa's meeting ends at 6:52 PM, which is after Helen's availability. So Helen can't be met in this case. So maybe Helen is skipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe fit Helen in between. Let's see. Suppose after Kimberly ends at 6:00 PM, travel to Financial District. From Haight-Ashbury to Financial District is 21 minutes. So arrive at 6:21 PM. But Helen's window is until 6:30 PM. So the user can meet Helen from 6:21\u20136:30 PM (9 minutes), which is less than the required 45. So not possible. So Helen can't be met in this schedule.\n\nSo perhaps Helen is skipped. Then after Lisa at 6:52 PM, next would be Laura at Sunset District. Laura is available from 5:45 PM to 9:15 PM, needs 90 minutes. So from 6:52 PM, the user can travel to Sunset District. Golden Gate Park to Sunset District is 10 minutes (travel time from Golden Gate Park to Sunset District is 10 min). So arrive at 7:02 PM. Meet Laura from 7:02\u20138:32 PM (90 min). Then after that, need to meet Elizabeth at Marina District from 7:00 PM to 8:45 PM. Wait, Elizabeth's meeting requires 105 minutes (1h45m). But if Laura's meeting ends at 8:32 PM, then traveling from Sunset District to Marina District. Travel time is 21 minutes. So arrive at 8:53 PM. But Elizabeth is available until 8:45 PM. So that's too late. So can't meet Elizabeth. Alternatively, adjust Laura's meeting to end earlier so that there's time to get to Elizabeth.\n\nAlternatively, let's see. Maybe meet Laura first after Lisa. Let's think:\n\nAfter Lisa ends at 6:52 PM, travel to Sunset District (10 min) arrive 7:02 PM. Meet Laura from 7:02\u20138:32 PM (90 min). Then, need to go to Marina District for Elizabeth, which is available until 8:45 PM. Travel time from Sunset District to Marina District is 21 minutes. So leaving at 8:32 PM, arrive 8:53 PM, which is after Elizabeth's end time. So can't meet Elizabeth.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Elizabeth before Laura. Let's see. After Lisa ends at 6:52 PM, go to Marina District. Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Marina District is 16 minutes. Arrive at 7:08 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 7:08 PM until 8:45 PM (her end time). Duration is 1h37m (97 minutes), which is less than the required 105. So not enough. Alternatively, start earlier. So maybe adjust the schedule to meet Elizabeth earlier.\n\nWait, what if after Kimberly's meeting (ends at 6:00 PM), go to Marina District? From Haight-Ashbury to Marina District is 17 minutes. Arrive at 6:17 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 6:17 PM to 8:02 PM (105 minutes). But Elizabeth is only available from 7:00 PM to 8:45 PM. So 6:17 PM is before her availability. So can't start until 7:00 PM. So meet from 7:00\u20138:45 PM. That's 105 minutes (7:00\u20138:45 is 1h45m). That works. Then after that, go to Laura. But Laura's available until 9:15 PM. Travel time from Marina District to Sunset District is 19 minutes. So leave Marina at 8:45 PM, arrive Sunset at 9:04 PM. Laura's window ends at 9:15 PM. So meet Laura from 9:04\u20139:15 PM (11 minutes), which is not enough. So can't meet Laura in this case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Laura before Elizabeth. Let's see. After Lisa ends at 6:52 PM, go to Sunset District (10 min), arrive 7:02 PM. Meet Laura until 8:32 PM (90 min). Then travel to Marina District (21 min), arrive 8:53 PM (too late for Elizabeth). So no.\n\nAlternatively, meet Elizabeth first, then Laura. But Elizabeth needs to start at 7:00 PM. So after Lisa ends at 6:52 PM, go to Marina District (16 min from Golden Gate Park to Marina). Arrive 7:08 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 7:08\u20138:45 PM (1h37m, which is 97 minutes; needs 105). Not enough. But Elizabeth is available until 8:45 PM. So the latest start time to get 105 minutes is 7:00 PM (105 minutes is 1h45m, so 7:00\u20138:45 PM). So if the user can arrive at Marina by 7:00 PM, they can meet Elizabeth from 7:00\u20138:45 PM. Then, after that, go to Laura. Travel time from Marina to Sunset is 19 min. Arrive at 9:04 PM. Laura's available until 9:15 PM. So meet from 9:04\u20139:15 PM (11 min). Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, meet Laura earlier. Let's think: Laura is available from 5:45 PM. Could she be met before Lisa? Let's see. Suppose after meeting Stephanie (ends 4:00 PM), go to Laura at Sunset District. Travel time from Alamo Square to Sunset District is 16 minutes. Arrive 4:16 PM. Laura's available from 5:45 PM. So need to wait until 5:45 PM. That's 1h29m wait. Not efficient. So maybe meet Laura from 5:45\u20137:15 PM (90 min). Then travel to Marina District (21 min), arrive 7:36 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 7:36\u20138:45 PM (69 minutes), which is less than 105. So not enough.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try a different approach. Let's prioritize the people with the earliest availability and see which ones can fit.\n\nFirst, start with Joshua (Presidio, available until 1:15 PM). Need 105 min. Then David (Embarcadero, until 12:30 PM). Then Stephanie (Alamo Square, 3:30\u20134:30 PM). Then Kimberly (Haight-Ashbury from 4:45 PM). Then Lisa (Golden Gate Park from 5:30 PM). Then Helen (Financial District 5:30\u20136:30 PM). Then Elizabeth (Marina District 7\u20138:45 PM). Then Timothy (North Beach 7:45\u201310 PM). Laura (Sunset District 5:45\u20139:15 PM).\n\nLet's try to fit as many as possible.\n\nStart at Castro at 9:00 AM.\n\n- 9:00 AM: Travel to Presidio (20 min), arrive 9:20 AM. Meet Joshua 9:20\u201311:05 AM (105 min).\n- 11:05 AM: Travel to Embarcadero (20 min), arrive 11:25 AM. Meet David 11:25\u201311:55 AM (30 min).\n- 11:55 AM: Next, possible to meet someone else? But no one available until 3:30 PM (Stephanie). So free time until 3:30 PM. Then:\n- 3:30 PM: Travel to Alamo Square. From Embarcadero to Alamo Square is 19 min. So leave Embarcadero at 3:11 PM to arrive at 3:30 PM. Meet Stephanie 3:30\u20134:00 PM (30 min).\n- 4:00 PM: Travel to Haight-Ashbury (5 min), arrive 4:05 PM. But Kimberly is available from 4:45 PM. So wait until 4:45 PM. Meet Kimberly 4:45\u20136:00 PM (75 min).\n- 6:00 PM: Travel to Golden Gate Park (7 min), arrive 6:07 PM. Meet Lisa 6:07\u20136:52 PM (45 min).\n- 6:52 PM: Travel to Financial District. From Golden Gate Park to Financial District is 26 minutes. Arrive 7:18 PM. But Helen's window is 5:30\u20136:30 PM. Too late. So can't meet Helen.\n- Next, Elizabeth at Marina District. Needs 105 min starting at 7:00 PM. From Financial District to Marina District is 15 minutes. So leave at 7:18 PM, arrive 7:33 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 7:33\u20138:45 PM (72 minutes), which is less than 105. Not enough.\n- Alternatively, after Lisa, go directly to Marina District. From Golden Gate Park to Marina District is 16 min. Arrive 6:52 +16 = 7:08 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 7:08\u20138:45 PM (97 min). Still not enough.\n- Maybe adjust the schedule to meet Elizabeth earlier. Let's see: After Kimberly (ends 6:00 PM), go to Marina District. From Haight-Ashbury to Marina District is 17 min. Arrive 6:17 PM. But Elizabeth is available from 7:00 PM. So wait until 7:00 PM. Meet 7:00\u20138:45 PM (105 min). That works. Then after that, go to Laura at Sunset District. From Marina District to Sunset District is 19 min. Arrive 9:04 PM. Laura's available until 9:15 PM. Meet 9:04\u20139:15 PM (11 min). Not enough. So Laura can't be met. Alternatively, skip Laura and meet Timothy.\n\nAfter meeting Elizabeth until 8:45 PM, travel to North Beach (Marina District to North Beach is 11 min). Arrive 8:56 PM. Timothy's available until 10:00 PM. Meet from 8:56\u201310:00 PM (64 min), which is less than the required 90. Not enough. So can't meet Timothy.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, go to Timothy. Marina District to North Beach is 11 min. Arrive 8:56 PM. Meet until 10:00 PM (64 min). Still not enough.\n\nHmm. So in this schedule, the user meets Joshua, David, Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, Elizabeth. That's 6 people. But Laura and Timothy can't be met. Is there a way to fit Laura in?\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Lisa at Golden Gate Park until 6:52 PM, go to Laura at Sunset District. Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Sunset is 10 min. Arrive 7:02 PM. Meet Laura 7:02\u20138:32 PM (90 min). Then travel to Marina District (19 min), arrive 8:51 PM. Elizabeth's available until 8:45 PM. Too late. So can't meet Elizabeth. So Elizabeth is skipped.\n\nAlternatively, meet Laura first. Let's see:\n\nAfter Lisa ends at 6:52 PM, go to Laura (Sunset District) 7:02\u20138:32 PM. Then, can't meet Elizabeth. But Timothy is available until 10 PM. From Sunset District to North Beach is 28 min. Arrive 9:00 PM. Meet Timothy 9:00\u201310:00 PM (60 min), less than required 90. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, meet Elizabeth instead of Laura. Let's see:\n\nAfter Lisa ends at 6:52 PM, go to Marina District (16 min), arrive 7:08 PM. Meet Elizabeth 7:08\u20138:45 PM (97 min). Then, can't meet Laura or Timothy.\n\nSo in this case, the user has to choose between Elizabeth and Laura. Which one gives more time? Elizabeth requires 105 min, but we can only give 97, which is insufficient. Laura requires 90 min, which can be met if scheduled after Lisa.\n\nBut earlier, after Lisa ends at 6:52 PM, Laura's available until 9:15 PM. Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Sunset is 10 min. Arrive 7:02 PM. Meet Laura 7:02\u20138:32 PM (90 min). Then travel to Marina District (19 min), arrive 8:51 PM. Elizabeth's window is until 8:45 PM. So can't meet her. So the user can meet Laura but not Elizabeth.\n\nAlternatively, meet Elizabeth first. After Kimberly ends at 6:00 PM, travel to Marina District (17 min), arrive 6:17 PM. Wait until 7:00 PM. Meet Elizabeth 7:00\u20138:45 PM (105 min). Then travel to Laura (Sunset District) 19 min, arrive 9:04 PM. Meet until 9:15 PM (11 min). So Laura can't be met. But Timothy is available until 10 PM. From Marina District to North Beach is 11 min. Arrive 8:56 PM. Meet until 10:00 PM (64 min). Still not enough.\n\nThis is tricky. The user needs to maximize the number of friends met. Let's count possible meetings in each scenario.\n\nScenario 1: Joshua, David, Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, Elizabeth. Total 6. Laura and Timothy not met.\n\nScenario 2: Joshua, David, Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, Laura. Total 6. Elizabeth and Timothy not met.\n\nScenario 3: Maybe skip Helen and others.\n\nAlternatively, can we fit Helen in somewhere?\n\nAfter meeting Stephanie at 4:00 PM, go to Financial District. Alamo Square to Financial District is 17 min. Arrive 4:17 PM. Helen is available from 5:30 PM. So wait until 5:30 PM. Meet Helen 5:30\u20136:15 PM (45 min). Then go to Kimberly at Haight-Ashbury. Financial District to Haight-Ashbury is 19 min. Arrive 6:34 PM. Kimberly is available until 9:30 PM. Meet from 6:34\u20137:49 PM (75 min). Then go to Golden Gate Park (7 min), arrive 7:56 PM. Meet Lisa 7:56\u20138:41 PM (45 min). Then go to Marina District (16 min), arrive 8:57 PM. Elizabeth's window ends at 8:45 PM. Can't meet her. Then go to Laura: Golden Gate Park to Sunset District (10 min), arrive 8:51 PM. Meet Laura until 9:15 PM (24 min). Not enough. Or go to Timothy: Golden Gate Park to North Beach (23 min), arrive 9:04 PM. Meet until 10:00 PM (56 min). Still not enough. So in this scenario, Helen is met, but Elizabeth and Laura are not. Total meetings: Joshua, David, Stephanie, Helen, Kimberly, Lisa. 6 again. \n\nSo whether it's 6 either way. Is there a way to get 7?\n\nLet me think. Suppose after meeting David at 11:55 AM, there's a lot of time until 3:30 PM. Is there any way to meet someone else during that time? But according to constraints, no one else is available. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the meeting with Joshua to start earlier, but user starts at 9:00 AM. Joshua's available from 8:30 AM, but user arrives at 9:00 AM. So can't start earlier.\n\nAnother idea: What if we meet Ronald? But Ronald is available from 8:00\u20139:30 AM. User arrives at The Castro at 9:00 AM. So travel to Richmond District from Castro takes 16 minutes. Arrive at 9:16 AM. Meet Ronald from 9:16\u20139:30 AM (14 minutes). Not enough for 90 min. So can't meet Ronald.\n\nSo Ronald is out.\n\nAnother possibility: After meeting David at Embarcadero until 11:55 AM, perhaps meet someone else. But the constraints don't show any other friends available then.\n\nSo, the maximum seems to be 6 meetings. Now, which 6 can fit the time.\n\nLet's try to fit in Elizabeth, Laura, and Timothy. Let's see:\n\nScenario where after Lisa ends at 6:52 PM, go to Laura (Sunset District) 7:02\u20138:32 PM (90 min). Then travel to Marina District (21 min), arrive 8:53 PM. Can't meet Elizabeth. Then go to North Beach (28 min from Sunset to North Beach). Arrive 9:21 PM. Timothy's available until 10:00 PM. Meet from 9:21\u201310:00 PM (39 min). Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after Laura ends at 8:32 PM, go to North Beach (28 min), arrive 9:00 PM. Meet until 10:00 PM (60 min). Not enough.\n\nSo can't meet both Laura and Timothy.\n\nAlternative plan: After Kimberly ends at 6:00 PM, go to Golden Gate Park (7 min). Meet Lisa from 6:07\u20136:52 PM. Then go to Financial District (26 min), arrive 7:18 PM. Helen's window is until 6:30 PM. Can't meet. Then go to Marina District (15 min), arrive 7:33 PM. Meet Elizabeth until 8:45 PM (72 min). Not enough. Then go to North Beach (11 min), arrive 8:56 PM. Meet Timothy until 10:00 PM (64 min). Not enough.\n\nThis is not working. Let's try a different order. Maybe meet Elizabeth first in the evening.\n\nAlternative itinerary:\n\n- Start at Castro 9:00 AM.\n\n- 9:20\u201311:05 AM: Joshua.\n\n- 11:05\u201311:25 travel to Embarcadero.\n\n- 11:25\u201311:55: David.\n\n- Then have free time until 3:30 PM.\n\n- 3:30\u20134:00: Stephanie.\n\n- 4:00\u20134:05 travel to Haight-Ashbury.\n\n- 4:45\u20136:00: Kimberly.\n\n- 6:00\u20136:07 travel to Golden Gate Park.\n\n- 6:07\u20136:52: Lisa.\n\n- 6:52\u20137:08 travel to Marina District.\n\n- 7:08\u20138:45: Elizabeth (97 min, which is less than 105, so insufficient).\n\nSo Elizabeth can't be met. Then, after Lisa:\n\n- 6:52 PM: Go to Laura (Sunset District) 7:02\u20138:32 PM.\n\n- Then go to North Beach for Timothy (arrive 9:00 PM, meet until 10:00 PM (60 min)).\n\nSo in this case, meet Joshua, David, Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, Laura, and Timothy (but Timothy's meeting is only 60 min, which is less than required 90). So only 6 valid meetings.\n\nAlternatively, meet Laura and Elizabeth, but not Timothy. But both require time.\n\nThis is really challenging. The optimal schedule seems to include Joshua, David, Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, and either Elizabeth or Laura. Since both require 105 and 90 minutes respectively, but only one can be fit. Let's check which one can be accommodated.\n\nIf we prioritize Elizabeth:\n\nAfter Lisa ends at 6:52 PM, travel to Marina District (16 min), arrive 7:08 PM. Meet until 8:45 PM (97 min). Not enough. So can't meet.\n\nIf we prioritize Laura:\n\nAfter Lisa, go to Laura (7:02\u20138:32 PM). Then travel to North Beach (28 min), arrive 9:00 PM. Meet Timothy until 10:00 PM (60 min). So meet Timothy but insufficient time.\n\nSo the valid meetings are Joshua, David, Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, and either Laura or Elizabeth (if possible). But in either case, the required minimum isn't met for Elizabeth, and Laura can be met but only if scheduled after Lisa.\n\nWait, Laura's meeting can be scheduled from 7:02\u20138:32 PM (90 min) which meets her requirement. So Laura is valid. But Elizabeth can't be met. So that's 6 meetings: Joshua, David, Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, Laura.\n\nThen, is there time to meet Helen or Timothy?\n\nHelen is available until 6:30 PM. After meeting Lisa at 6:52 PM, it's too late. So Helen is skipped. Timothy's meeting is insufficient. So total 6.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Laura (8:32 PM), travel to North Beach (28 min), arrive 9:00 PM. Meet Timothy until 10:00 PM (60 min), but that's less than 90. So no.\n\nSo the maximum valid meetings are 6.\n\nNow, let's check if there's another way to fit in more meetings. For example, after meeting Stephanie at 4:00 PM, go to Helen. But Helen isn't available until 5:30 PM.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps meet Helen between Kimberly and Lisa.\n\nKimberly ends at 6:00 PM. Travel to Financial District (21 min) from Haight-Ashbury. Arrive 6:21 PM. Meet Helen from 6:21\u20136:30 PM (9 min). Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, meet Helen before Kimberly. After Stephanie, go to Financial District. Alamo Square to Financial District is 17 min. Arrive 4:17 PM. Helen isn't available until 5:30 PM. So wait until 5:30 PM, meet until 6:15 PM (45 min). Then go to Kimberly at Haight-Ashbury (19 min), arrive 6:34 PM. Meet until 7:49 PM (75 min). Then go to Lisa at Golden Gate Park (7 min), arrive 7:56 PM. Meet until 8:41 PM (45 min). Then go to Elizabeth (16 min to Marina District), arrive 8:57 PM. Can't meet. Then Laura: from Golden Gate Park to Sunset (10 min), arrive 8:51 PM. Meet until 9:15 PM (24 min). No. Or go to North Beach (23 min), arrive 9:04 PM. Meet Timothy until 10:00 PM (56 min). No. So this gives Helen, Kimberly, Lisa, but skips Elizabeth and Laura. So total 6 again (Joshua, David, Stephanie, Helen, Kimberly, Lisa).\n\nSo whether we choose to meet Laura or Helen, the total is 6.\n\nWhich combination is better? Let's check the minimum times:\n\n- Elizabeth requires 105, but can't be met.\n\n- Laura requires 90, which can be met if scheduled.\n\n- Helen requires 45, which can be met if scheduled.\n\nSo meeting Helen adds another person, but Laura also adds another. However, in the scenario where we meet Laura, we can't meet Helen. So both are sixth meetings.\n\nIn the initial plan, without Helen, but with Laura, it's six. In the other scenario, with Helen and Lisa, but not Laura, also six.\n\nBut perhaps the user would prefer to meet more friends even if they don't all meet the minimum time? No, the constraints specify that each meeting must meet the minimum required duration.\n\nThus, the maximum possible is six meetings. Now, the question is which six.\n\nThe best possible schedule is:\n\n1. Joshua (105 min)\n\n2. David (30 min)\n\n3. Stephanie (30 min)\n\n4. Kimberly (75 min)\n\n5. Lisa (45 min)\n\n6. Laura (90 min)\n\nOr alternatively, including Helen instead of Laura.\n\nBut in the Laura scenario, we can meet her for the full 90 minutes. In the Helen scenario, we can meet her for 45 minutes.\n\nSo the Laura option is better because it meets her required time, and she's a sixth person. Helen can't be met in this case because of the overlap with Kimberly and Lisa.\n\nThus, the itinerary should include Joshua, David, Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, and Laura.\n\nNow, let's build the timeline with these meetings:\n\n- 9:00 AM start at The Castro.\n\n- Travel to Presidio (20 min): 9:00\u20139:20 AM.\n\n- Meet Joshua 9:20\u201311:05 AM (105 min).\n\n- Travel to Embarcadero (20 min): 11:05\u201311:25 AM.\n\n- Meet David 11:25\u201311:55 AM (30 min).\n\n- Then free time until 3:30 PM.\n\n- Travel to Alamo Square (19 min from Embarcadero, leave at 3:11 PM, arrive 3:30 PM).\n\n- Meet Stephanie 3:30\u20134:00 PM (30 min).\n\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury (5 min): 4:00\u20134:05 PM.\n\n- Wait until 4:45 PM, then meet Kimberly 4:45\u20136:00 PM (75 min).\n\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park (7 min): 6:00\u20136:07 PM.\n\n- Meet Lisa 6:07\u20136:52 PM (45 min).\n\n- Travel to Sunset District (10 min): 6:52\u20137:02 PM.\n\n- Meet Laura 7:02\u20138:32 PM (90 min).\n\n- Then, after that, possible to meet Timothy? Travel to North Beach (28 min), arrive 9:00 PM. Meet until 10:00 PM (60 min). Not enough. So no.\n\nThus, the itinerary includes six meetings: Joshua, David, Stephanie, Kimberly, Lisa, Laura.\n\nNow, verifying travel times and overlaps:\n\nJoshua: 9:20\u201311:05 AM.\n\nTravel to Embarcadero: 20 min. Arrive 11:25 AM.\n\nDavid: 11:25\u201311:55 AM.\n\nFree time until 3:30 PM.\n\nLeave Embarcadero at 3:11 PM (19 min travel to Alamo Square for 3:30 PM arrival).\n\nStephanie: 3:30\u20134:00 PM.\n\nTravel to Haight-Ashbury (5 min), arrive 4:05 PM. Wait until 4:45 PM.\n\nKimberly: 4:45\u20136:00 PM.\n\nTravel to Golden Gate Park (7 min), arrive 6:07 PM.\n\nLisa: 6:07\u20136:52 PM.\n\nTravel to Sunset District (10 min), arrive 7:02 PM.\n\nLaura: 7:02\u20138:32 PM.\n\nAll meetings meet the minimum required durations, and travel times are accounted for.\n\nThis seems to work. Now, let's format this into the JSON as specified.",
