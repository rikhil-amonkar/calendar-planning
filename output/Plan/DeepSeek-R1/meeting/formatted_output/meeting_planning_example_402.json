            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The user wants to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and constraints. Let me start by listing out all the constraints and available times for each person.\n\nFirst, the user arrives at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. The earliest meeting would be there, but looking at the friends' availability:\n\nMatthew is at Marina District from 9:15 AM to 12:00 PM. The user needs to meet him for at least 15 minutes. Since the user starts at Golden Gate Park, they need to travel to Marina District. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Marina District is 16 minutes. So leaving Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM, arrival would be 9:16 AM. But Matthew is available from 9:15 AM. Wait, that's a problem. If they leave at 9:00, arrive at 9:16, which is after 9:15. So maybe they can start traveling right at 9:00, arrive by 9:16. Then meet Matthew from 9:16 AM. The meeting needs at least 15 minutes. So end time could be 9:31 AM. But Matthew is available until 12 PM, so that's possible. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps meet Matthew first thing after arrival. But the user arrives at Golden Gate Park at 9:00, but Matthew is in Marina District. So the first action has to be to travel to Marina District. Wait, but the user starts at Golden Gate Park, so the initial location is there. So first action is to leave Golden Gate Park to go to Marina District. Let's note that.\n\nThen after meeting Matthew, the next possible meetings. Let's see who else is available in the morning. Robert is available from 10:15 AM to 9:45 PM at Union Square. The user needs to meet him for at least 15 minutes. So after meeting Matthew, maybe go to Union Square. Let's see the travel time from Marina District to Union Square. Looking at the travel times: Marina District to Union Square is 16 minutes. If the user finishes with Matthew at 9:31, leaves at 9:31, arrives at Union Square at 9:47. But Robert is only available from 10:15 AM. So there's a wait time from 9:47 to 10:15. That's 28 minutes. Alternatively, maybe the user can adjust the meeting time with Matthew to end later so that the arrival at Union Square is closer to 10:15. Wait, Matthew can be met anytime between 9:15 AM to 12 PM. Suppose the user leaves Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM, arrives Marina at 9:16. Then meets Matthew from 9:16 to 9:31 (15 minutes). Then travels to Union Square (16 minutes), arriving 9:47. But Robert isn't available until 10:15. So the user would have to wait until 10:15 to meet Robert. That's 28 minutes of waiting. Alternatively, maybe extend the meeting with Matthew to end at 10:00 AM, but that's longer than the required 15 minutes. Wait, the minimum is 15, but can be longer. But maybe better to meet him for the minimum and then use the time elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps adjust the schedule to meet someone else first.\n\nWait, maybe after meeting Matthew, the user can go to another location where a friend is available earlier. Let's check the other friends' availability in the morning. The other friends (Sarah, Patricia, Joseph) are available in the afternoon or evening. Only Robert is available starting at 10:15 AM. So after Matthew, the next possible is Robert. But the user would have to wait until 10:15. Alternatively, maybe there's another friend available in the morning. Let me check again. Matthew is in Marina District until noon, Joseph is in Financial District from 2:15 PM, Patricia and Sarah in the evening. So only Robert is available starting 10:15 AM. So perhaps the user can meet Robert at Union Square starting at 10:15. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo after meeting Matthew from 9:16-9:31, then travel to Union Square takes 16 minutes, arriving 9:47. Wait until 10:15, then meet Robert for 15 minutes until 10:30. Then what's next? Next, Joseph is available from 2:15 PM in Financial District. So between 10:30 AM and 2:15 PM, there's time. Are there any other friends available? Patricia and Sarah are in the evening. So maybe during this gap, the user can meet Robert again later? Wait, no, Robert is available all day until 9:45 PM. But the user only needs to meet him once for 15 minutes. So after meeting Robert at 10:15-10:30, the user can then plan other meetings.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize. Maybe after Matthew, go to a location that's closer to another friend. Let's see. From Marina District, the user can go to Financial District (17 minutes), but Joseph isn't available until 2:15 PM. Or to Union Square (16 minutes). Alternatively, maybe go to Haight-Ashbury, but Sarah is only available from 5 PM. So perhaps the best is to meet Robert next.\n\nWait, let's check the travel times again. From Marina District to Union Square is 16 minutes. So arrival at 9:47, but can't meet Robert until 10:15. So the user has to wait. Alternatively, maybe meet Robert later in the day when it's more convenient. For example, after meeting Joseph in the afternoon, perhaps meet Robert in the evening. But let's think through the entire day.\n\nLet's outline possible schedule:\n\nStart at Golden Gate Park (9:00 AM).\n\n9:00 AM: Depart to Marina District (16 minutes travel).\n\nArrive at 9:16 AM. Meet Matthew from 9:16 to 9:31 (15 minutes). Then, depart at 9:31.\n\nNext, possible destinations: Union Square (16 minutes), arriving at 9:47. But Robert isn't available until 10:15. So wait until 10:15, then meet from 10:15-10:30. Then, from Union Square, next possible meetings. Joseph is in Financial District from 2:15 PM. Between 10:30 AM and 2:15 PM, there's time. Maybe go somewhere else. But no other friends are available in that time. Alternatively, maybe go to Haight-Ashbury later, but Sarah is only available from 5 PM. Patricia is available from 5 PM in Sunset District. So perhaps after Robert, the user can go to another location, but there's a gap until Joseph's availability at 2:15 PM.\n\nWait, maybe after meeting Robert at 10:30, the user can go to Financial District to meet Joseph early. But Joseph is only available from 2:15 PM. So the user would have to wait until 2:15. Let's check travel time from Union Square to Financial District: 9 minutes. So if the user leaves Union Square at 10:30, arrives at Financial District at 10:39. But Joseph isn't available until 2:15. That's a long wait. Not efficient. Alternatively, maybe spend time elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Robert at 10:30, the user could go to another location, like Golden Gate Park again, but no friends there. Or maybe go to Haight-Ashbury, but Sarah isn't available until 5 PM. So maybe that's not useful. So perhaps the user should stay in Union Square until closer to Joseph's availability. But that would involve a lot of waiting. Alternatively, maybe adjust the order of meetings.\n\nWait, perhaps meet Robert later in the day. For example, after meeting Joseph in the afternoon, then go to Union Square again. Let's see. Let's try a different order.\n\nAfter meeting Matthew at 9:16-9:31, the user can go to Financial District directly? But Joseph is only available from 2:15 PM. Travel time from Marina District to Financial District is 17 minutes. Arrive at 9:48 AM. Then wait until 2:15 PM. That's way too long. Not feasible. So that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, after Matthew, go to Haight-Ashbury? But Sarah is only available from 5 PM. Travel time from Marina to Haight-Ashbury is 16 minutes. Arrive at 9:47 AM. Then wait until 5 PM. No, that's not possible.\n\nHmm. So maybe the initial plan is the best: Meet Matthew, then Robert, then have a gap until Joseph at 2:15 PM, then meet Joseph, then meet Patricia and Sarah in the evening.\n\nBut the gap from 10:30 AM to 2:15 PM is a long time. Maybe during that time, the user can do something else. Are there any other friends available? Let's check again. Robert is available all day. But the user needs to meet him only once. Joseph is 2:15 PM to 6:45 PM. Patricia and Sarah in the evening. So perhaps in the gap, the user can meet Robert for a longer time, but that's not required. The minimum is 15 minutes, so maybe meet him again later? But the user only needs to meet each person once. So the initial meeting with Robert is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the schedule to meet Joseph earlier by moving the meeting to right after 2:15 PM. Let's see.\n\nAfter meeting Robert at 10:30, the user has until 2:15 PM. So they can go somewhere else. Let's check the travel time from Union Square to Financial District is 9 minutes. If the user leaves Union Square at, say, 2:00 PM, arrives at Financial District at 2:09 PM. But Joseph is available at 2:15. So wait until 2:15, then meet Joseph for 30 minutes until 2:45 PM. Then, after that, the user can go to either Patricia or Sarah in the evening.\n\nWait, Patricia is in Sunset District from 5 PM to 7:45 PM, needs 45 minutes. Sarah is in Haight-Ashbury from 5 PM to 9:30 PM, needs 105 minutes. Joseph ends at 6:45 PM. So after meeting Joseph, the user can go to either Patricia or Sarah.\n\nLet's plan this:\n\nMatthew: 9:16-9:31 AM (Marina District)\nRobert: 10:15-10:30 AM (Union Square)\nJoseph: 2:15-2:45 PM (Financial District)\nThen, after Joseph, travel to either Patricia or Sarah.\n\nBut let's calculate the travel times. From Financial District to Sunset District (Patricia) is 30 minutes. From Financial District to Haight-Ashbury (Sarah) is 19 minutes. Let's see:\n\nIf the user leaves Financial District at 2:45 PM, arrives at Haight-Ashbury at 3:04 PM (19 minutes). But Sarah is only available from 5 PM. So they have to wait until 5 PM. That's almost two hours. Alternatively, go to Sunset District, arrive at 3:15 PM (30 minutes from 2:45). Patricia is available from 5 PM. Also a wait. So that's not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can meet Joseph later, closer to 5 PM, so that after meeting Joseph, they can go directly to Patricia or Sarah. Let's see. Joseph is available until 6:45 PM. Suppose the user meets Joseph from 6:15-6:45 PM (30 minutes). Then, after that, travel to Patricia (Sunset District) which takes 30 minutes, arriving at 7:15 PM. But Patricia is available until 7:45 PM. So meeting from 7:15-7:45 PM (30 minutes), which is less than the required 45 minutes. Not enough. Alternatively, go to Sarah in Haight-Ashbury, which takes 19 minutes, arriving at 7:04 PM. Sarah is available until 9:30 PM. Meeting from 7:04-8:49 PM (105 minutes). That works. But then Patricia's window (until 7:45 PM) would be missed. So if the user wants to meet both Sarah and Patricia, they need to fit both after 5 PM.\n\nAlternatively, meet Patricia first, then Sarah. Let's think:\n\nAfter Joseph, leave Financial District at 2:45 PM. Travel to Sunset District (Patricia) takes 30 minutes, arriving 3:15 PM. But Patricia is available from 5 PM. So wait until 5 PM. Meet from 5:00-5:45 PM (45 minutes). Then travel to Haight-Ashbury (Sarah). Travel time from Sunset to Haight-Ashbury is 15 minutes. Arrive at 6:00 PM. Meet Sarah from 6:00-7:45 PM (105 minutes). That works. But let's check if the travel times fit.\n\nWait, after meeting Patricia until 5:45 PM, depart at 5:45. Travel time to Haight-Ashbury is 15 minutes. Arrive at 6:00 PM. Then meet Sarah until 7:45 PM (105 minutes). But Sarah is available until 9:30 PM, so that's fine. Then the user can meet Sarah from 6:00 to 7:45 PM. That meets the 105-minute requirement. But Patricia's meeting is from 5:00-5:45 PM (45 minutes), which meets her requirement. That seems possible.\n\nBut how to fit Joseph into this. Joseph needs to be met for 30 minutes between 2:15 PM and 6:45 PM. If the user meets Joseph from, say, 2:15-2:45 PM, then travels to Sunset District (30 minutes), arrives 3:15 PM. Then waits until 5 PM to meet Patricia. That's a long wait (1 hour 45 minutes). Alternatively, meet Joseph later. For example, meet Joseph from 4:15-4:45 PM. Then travel to Sunset District (30 minutes), arrive 5:15 PM. But Patricia is available until 7:45 PM. Meeting from 5:15-6:00 PM (45 minutes). Then travel to Haight-Ashbury (15 minutes), arrive 6:15 PM, meet Sarah until 8:00 PM (105 minutes). That works.\n\nBut let's check the timeline:\n\nMatthew: 9:16-9:31 AM (Marina District)\nRobert: 10:15-10:30 AM (Union Square)\nJoseph: 4:15-4:45 PM (Financial District)\nPatricia: 5:15-6:00 PM (Sunset District)\nSarah: 6:15-8:00 PM (Haight-Ashbury)\n\nBut need to check travel times between each step.\n\nFrom Robert's meeting at Union Square ends at 10:30 AM. The next meeting is Joseph at Financial District from 4:15 PM. So between 10:30 AM and 4:15 PM, there's a gap. How is that filled? The user could stay in Union Square until it's time to go to Financial District. Travel time from Union Square to Financial District is 9 minutes. If they leave Union Square at 4:06 PM, arrive at 4:15 PM. Then meet Joseph from 4:15-4:45 PM. Then go to Sunset District (30 minutes), arrive 5:15 PM. Meet Patricia until 6:00 PM. Then to Haight-Ashbury (15 minutes), arrive 6:15 PM. Meet until 8:00 PM. That works.\n\nBut the gap from 10:30 AM to 4:15 PM is a long time. Can the user meet Robert again? No, because the minimum is already met. So perhaps during that time, the user can do other things, but there's no other friends available. So maybe this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the meeting with Robert to later in the day. For example, after Joseph, meet Robert in Union Square again. Let's see:\n\nMatthew: 9:16-9:31 AM\nJoseph: 2:15-2:45 PM (Financial District)\nRobert: 3:00-3:15 PM (Union Square)\nBut travel from Financial District to Union Square is 9 minutes. So after Joseph ends at 2:45 PM, leave at 2:45, arrive Union Square at 2:54 PM. Robert is available until 9:45 PM. Meet from 2:54-3:09 PM (15 minutes). Then travel to Sunset District (Patricia). Travel time from Union Square to Sunset District is 26 minutes. Arrive at 3:35 PM. Patricia is available from 5 PM. Wait until 5 PM. Meet 5:00-5:45 PM. Then to Haight-Ashbury: 15 minutes. Arrive 6:00 PM, meet Sarah until 7:45 PM. That works. But this way, the user meets Joseph, Robert, Patricia, and Sarah. That's four friends, which is better.\n\nWait, but originally, the user had to meet Matthew, Robert, Joseph, Patricia, and Sarah. Five friends. But in this scenario, Matthew, Joseph, Robert, Patricia, Sarah\u2014all five. Let's check.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, the user meets Matthew, Robert, Joseph, Patricia, Sarah. But in the second scenario, after Matthew, meet Joseph, then Robert, then Patricia, then Sarah. That also covers all five. So that's better.\n\nBut let's see if the timeline works:\n\nStart at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM.\n\nTravel to Marina District (16 minutes): arrive 9:16 AM. Meet Matthew from 9:16-9:31 AM.\n\nThen travel to Financial District to meet Joseph. Wait, Joseph is available from 2:15 PM. So after Matthew, the user has to wait until 2:15 PM to meet Joseph. How? From Marina District, the user can go to Financial District directly. Travel time is 17 minutes. So leave Marina at 9:31, arrive Financial District at 9:48 AM. But Joseph isn't available until 2:15 PM. That's a long wait. Not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after Matthew, go to Union Square to meet Robert. Let's try:\n\nMatthew: 9:16-9:31 AM (Marina)\nTravel to Union Square: 16 minutes, arrive 9:47 AM. Robert is available from 10:15 AM. Wait until 10:15, meet 10:15-10:30 AM.\n\nThen, from Union Square, the user can go to Financial District (9 minutes) to meet Joseph. But Joseph is available from 2:15 PM. So from 10:30 AM to 2:15 PM, the user can't meet anyone. Unless they can schedule another meeting with Robert again, but they only need to meet him once. So maybe use that time to travel to another location and wait.\n\nBut it's a long gap. Alternatively, perhaps meet Joseph later, closer to 6:45 PM. Let's try:\n\nAfter meeting Robert at 10:30 AM, the user has until 2:15 PM. Maybe go to Golden Gate Park and wait, but no friends there. Alternatively, go to Haight-Ashbury, but Sarah isn't available until 5 PM. So the user has to wait.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to rearrange the order of meetings to minimize waiting time. Let's try:\n\nStart at Golden Gate Park 9:00 AM.\n\nMeet Matthew first: 9:16-9:31 AM.\n\nThen go to Union Square to meet Robert: arrives 9:47 AM, wait until 10:15 AM, meet 10:15-10:30 AM.\n\nThen, from Union Square, go to Financial District (9 minutes) to meet Joseph at 2:15 PM. So the user has from 10:30 AM to 2:15 PM free. That's 3 hours 45 minutes. They could wait there or explore, but it's not optimal.\n\nAlternatively, meet Joseph earlier if possible. But he's available from 2:15 PM. So the earliest meeting with Joseph is 2:15-2:45 PM.\n\nAfter that, travel to Sunset District to meet Patricia. Travel time from Financial District to Sunset is 31 minutes. So leave at 2:45 PM, arrive 3:16 PM. Patricia is available from 5 PM. So wait until 5 PM, meet until 5:45 PM (45 minutes). Then travel to Haight-Ashbury (15 minutes), arrive 6:00 PM. Meet Sarah until 7:45 PM (105 minutes). That works.\n\nSo the schedule would be:\n\nMatthew: 9:16-9:31 AM (Marina)\nRobert: 10:15-10:30 AM (Union Square)\nJoseph: 2:15-2:45 PM (Financial)\nPatricia: 5:00-5:45 PM (Sunset)\nSarah: 6:00-7:45 PM (Haight-Ashbury)\n\nBut wait, Patricia's meeting starts at 5 PM exactly. The user arrives at Sunset District at 3:16 PM, but Patricia isn't available until 5 PM. So the user has to wait from 3:16 PM to 5 PM. That's 1 hour 44 minutes. Not ideal, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, can the user meet Patricia later? She's available until 7:45 PM. So after meeting Sarah, but Sarah needs 105 minutes. If the user meets Sarah from 5:00 PM to 6:45 PM, then travels to Sunset District (15 minutes), arrives 7:00 PM. Meet Patricia from 7:00-7:45 PM (45 minutes). But Patricia is available until 7:45, so that works. Let's see:\n\nMatthew: 9:16-9:31 AM\nRobert: 10:15-10:30 AM\nJoseph: 2:15-2:45 PM\nSarah: 5:00-6:45 PM (Haight-Ashbury)\nPatricia: 7:00-7:45 PM (Sunset District)\n\nBut travel from Joseph's location (Financial District) to Sarah's (Haight-Ashbury) after Joseph's meeting. Joseph ends at 2:45 PM. Then the user has from 2:45 PM to 5:00 PM. They need to travel to Haight-Ashbury. Financial District to Haight-Ashbury is 19 minutes. So leave at 4:41 PM to arrive by 5:00 PM. That leaves 2:45 PM to 4:41 PM as free time. But the user can use that time to meet Robert again or do something else, but no friends are available. Alternatively, the user can meet Robert during that time. But Robert is already met in the morning. So the user can't meet him again. So maybe that's acceptable.\n\nSo the schedule would be:\n\n9:16-9:31 AM: Meet Matthew (Marina)\n10:15-10:30 AM: Meet Robert (Union Square)\n2:15-2:45 PM: Meet Joseph (Financial)\n5:00-6:45 PM: Meet Sarah (Haight-Ashbury)\n7:00-7:45 PM: Meet Patricia (Sunset District)\n\nThis meets all five friends with their required minimum times.\n\nCheck travel times between meetings:\n\n1. After Matthew (Marina District) to Union Square: 16 minutes. Ends at 9:31 AM, start travel at 9:31, arrive 9:47 AM. Robert starts at 10:15. So wait 28 minutes.\n\n2. After Robert (Union Square) to Financial District: 9 minutes. Ends at 10:30 AM, start travel at 10:30, arrive 10:39 AM. Then wait until 2:15 PM. Long wait.\n\n3. After Joseph (Financial District) to Haight-Ashbury: 19 minutes. Ends at 2:45 PM, start travel at 2:45, arrive 3:04 PM. Wait until 5:00 PM to meet Sarah.\n\n4. After Sarah (Haight-Ashbury) to Sunset District: 15 minutes. Ends at 6:45 PM, start travel at 6:45, arrive 7:00 PM. Meet Patricia until 7:45 PM.\n\nBut wait, Sarah's meeting is from 5:00-6:45 PM. Then travel to Sunset District takes 15 minutes, arriving 7:00 PM. Patricia is available until 7:45 PM. So meeting from 7:00-7:45 PM (45 minutes). That works.\n\nNow, let's check if all the minimum times are met:\n\n- Matthew: 15 minutes \u2714\ufe0f\n- Robert: 15 minutes \u2714\ufe0f\n- Joseph: 30 minutes \u2714\ufe0f\n- Sarah: 105 minutes \u2714\ufe0f\n- Patricia: 45 minutes \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes. All are met. And the user starts at Golden Gate Park, travels to Marina, then Union Square, Financial, Haight-Ashbury, and Sunset.\n\nBut let's double-check the travel times and ensure there's no overlap or impossible transitions.\n\nAnother possible issue is the time between Joseph and Sarah. After Joseph ends at 2:45 PM, the user has to wait until 5 PM to meet Sarah. Can they do something else in between? If not, then this is acceptable, but it's a long wait. However, the user's goal is to meet as many friends as possible, and this schedule meets all five, which is optimal.\n\nAlternatively, can the user meet Patricia first and then Sarah? Let's see:\n\nAfter Joseph, go to Sunset District (31 minutes from Financial). Arrive at 3:16 PM. Wait until 5 PM, meet Patricia until 5:45 PM. Then travel to Haight-Ashbury (15 minutes), arrive 6:00 PM, meet Sarah until 7:45 PM. That's the same as earlier.\n\nAlternatively, after Joseph, go to Haight-Ashbury (19 minutes), arrive 3:04 PM. Wait until 5 PM, meet Sarah until 6:45 PM. Then go to Sunset District (15 minutes), arrive 7:00 PM, meet Patricia until 7:45 PM. Same as before.\n\nEither way, the user has to wait for Patricia or Sarah after Joseph. But since both are in the evening, this seems unavoidable. This schedule meets all five friends, which is the maximum possible given the constraints.",
