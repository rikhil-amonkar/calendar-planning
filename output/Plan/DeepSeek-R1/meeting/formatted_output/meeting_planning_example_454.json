            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. First, I need to figure out how to meet as many friends as possible while respecting the time constraints and travel times. Let me start by listing all the friends and their availability:\n\n- Jessica: Golden Gate Park, 1:45PM to 3:00PM (needs 30 min)\n- Ashley: Bayview, 5:15PM to 8:00PM (needs 105 min)\n- Ronald: Chinatown, 7:15AM to 2:45PM (needs 90 min)\n- William: North Beach, 1:15PM to 8:15PM (needs 15 min)\n- Daniel: Mission District, 7:00AM to 11:15AM (needs 105 min)\n\nI start at Presidio at 9:00 AM. Let's see who's available first. Daniel is in Mission District until 11:15 AM and needs 105 minutes (1 hour 45 min). If I leave Presidio at 9:00 AM, it takes 26 minutes to get to Mission District. Wait, the travel time from Presidio to Mission District is 26 minutes. So leaving at 9:00 AM, arrival at 9:26 AM. Daniel is available until 11:15 AM. Let's calculate: 9:26 AM to 11:15 AM is 1 hour 49 minutes. If we start at 9:26, meet until 11:11 AM (105 minutes later would be 9:26 + 1h45 = 11:11 AM). Then leave Mission District. But Daniel's end time is 11:15, so that works. So Daniel from 9:26 to 11:11 AM.\n\nNext, after meeting Daniel, where to go next? Let's see the other friends. Ronald is in Chinatown until 2:45 PM and needs 90 minutes. So maybe after Daniel, go to Chinatown. Let's check travel time from Mission District to Chinatown. The table says Mission District to Chinatown is 16 minutes. If we leave Mission District at 11:11 AM, arrive Chinatown at 11:27 AM. Ronald is available until 2:45 PM. So from 11:27 AM to 1:57 PM (90 minutes). That would end at 11:27 + 1h30 = 12:57 PM. Wait, 90 minutes is 1h30, so 11:27 + 1h30 = 12:57 PM. Then we have time after that. Let's see. Then next, Jessica is at Golden Gate Park from 1:45 PM to 3 PM. Needs 30 min. So we need to be there by 1:45 PM. Let's see, after meeting Ronald until 12:57 PM, can we get to Golden Gate Park in time? Travel time from Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes. If we leave at 12:57, arrive at 1:20 PM. Then we have some time before Jessica's availability. But Jessica starts at 1:45 PM. So maybe we can meet her from 1:45 PM to 2:15 PM. Then after that, maybe William at North Beach. William is available from 1:15 PM to 8:15 PM, needs 15 min. Golden Gate Park to North Beach is 24 minutes. If we leave Golden Gate Park at 2:15 PM, arrive at North Beach at 2:39 PM. Meet William from 2:39 PM to 2:54 PM. Then maybe go to Bayview to meet Ashley. Travel from North Beach to Bayview is 22 minutes. Arrive at 3:16 PM. But Ashley is available from 5:15 PM. Hmm, that's a gap. Wait, that's a problem. So after meeting William, we have time until 5:15 PM. So maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, after Jessica, maybe go to North Beach first, then to Bayview. Let's re-examine. Let's see, after Jessica ends at 2:15 PM, travel to North Beach (24 minutes from Golden Gate Park to North Beach), arriving at 2:39 PM. Meet William until 2:54 PM. Then, from North Beach to Bayview is 22 minutes, arriving at 3:16 PM. But Ashley is available from 5:15 PM. So there's a gap of 2 hours. Not efficient. Maybe we can adjust the order.\n\nWait, perhaps after Ronald, instead of going to Jessica, we can meet William first. Let's see. After meeting Ronald until 12:57 PM, we can go to North Beach. From Chinatown to North Beach is 3 minutes (Chinatown to North Beach). So leave at 12:57, arrive at 1:00 PM. William is available from 1:15 PM. Wait, William's time starts at 1:15 PM. So maybe we can wait until 1:15 PM. So meet William from 1:15 PM to 1:30 PM (15 min). Then travel to Golden Gate Park for Jessica. From North Beach to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes. Arrive at 1:52 PM. But Jessica is available from 1:45 PM. So if we start at 1:45 PM, but we can't be there until 1:52 PM. So we can meet Jessica from 1:52 PM to 2:22 PM (30 min). But Jessica's end time is 3:00 PM, so that's okay. Then after that, go to Bayview for Ashley. From Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 23 minutes, arrive at 2:45 PM. But Ashley is available from 5:15 PM. So again, a long wait. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Ronald, go to Golden Gate Park first. Let's see. After meeting Ronald until 12:57 PM, travel to Golden Gate Park (Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 minutes). Arrive at 1:20 PM. Jessica is available from 1:45 PM, so we have to wait until 1:45 PM. Meet her from 1:45 PM to 2:15 PM. Then, from Golden Gate Park to North Beach is 24 minutes, arrive at 2:39 PM. Meet William from 2:39 PM to 2:54 PM. Then from North Beach to Bayview is 22 minutes, arrive at 3:16 PM. Still too early for Ashley. So this approach isn't working.\n\nWait, Ashley needs 105 minutes (1h45m). She's available from 5:15 PM to 8:00 PM. So the latest we can start meeting her is 6:15 PM (8:00 - 1h45 = 6:15 PM). So we need to arrive by 6:15 PM. Let's see if after meeting William, we can go to Bayview. For example, after meeting William at 2:54 PM, then go to Bayview. But that's too early, but maybe we can do something else in between. Wait, maybe we can fit another meeting? But all other friends are already met: Daniel, Ronald, Jessica, William. Ashley is the only one left. So perhaps we can have some time between 3:16 PM and 5:15 PM. But there's no other friends to meet. So perhaps the schedule is okay with that gap. But the user wants to meet as many friends as possible. All five are possible? Let's check.\n\nDaniel: 105 min (must be in Mission District before 11:15 AM)\nRonald: 90 min (must be in Chinatown before 2:45 PM)\nJessica: 30 min (1:45 PM to 3 PM)\nWilliam: 15 min (1:15 PM onwards)\nAshley: 105 min (after 5:15 PM)\n\nSo all five can be met if we can fit their times with travel.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe start with Daniel first, then Ronald, then William, then Jessica, then Ashley.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nStart at Presidio at 9:00 AM.\n\nTravel to Mission District (26 min): arrive 9:26 AM. Meet Daniel until 11:11 AM (105 min). Then go to Chinatown. From Mission District to Chinatown is 16 min. Arrive 11:27 AM. Meet Ronald from 11:27 AM to 1:57 PM (90 min). Then go to North Beach (3 min from Chinatown). Arrive 1:57 PM + 3 = 2:00 PM. But William is available from 1:15 PM. So meet William from 2:00 PM to 2:15 PM. Then travel to Golden Gate Park (North Beach to Golden Gate Park is 22 min). Arrive 2:37 PM. But Jessica is only available until 3 PM. So meet from 2:37 PM to 3:00 PM (23 minutes). But she needs 30 min. That's not enough. So this approach fails for Jessica.\n\nAlternative: After meeting Ronald until 1:57 PM, travel to Golden Gate Park. From Chinatown to Golden Gate Park is 23 min. Arrive at 1:57 + 23 = 2:20 PM. Jessica's window ends at 3 PM. So meet from 2:20 PM to 2:50 PM (30 min). That works. Then go to North Beach (24 min travel) from Golden Gate Park. Arrive 2:50 +24=3:14 PM. Meet William from 3:14 PM to 3:29 PM. Then go to Bayview: North Beach to Bayview is 22 min. Arrive 3:51 PM. But Ashley isn't available until 5:15 PM. So again, a long gap.\n\nAlternatively, after Jessica, go to Bayview via Golden Gate Park to Bayview (23 min). Arrive at 2:50 +23=3:13 PM. Still too early for Ashley. So need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps after meeting William, go to Bayview. Let's see:\n\nFrom meeting William ends at 3:29 PM. Travel to Bayview takes 22 min. Arrive 3:51 PM. Still early. But Ashley is available at 5:15 PM. So from 3:51 PM to 5:15 PM is 1h24m. That's a long wait, but maybe unavoidable.\n\nThen meet Ashley from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM (105 min). That works.\n\nSo the schedule would be:\n\nDaniel: 9:26-11:11\n\nRonald: 11:27-12:57 (Wait, 11:27 to 12:57 is 90 min? 11:27 + 1h30 = 12:57. Yes.)\n\nTravel to Golden Gate Park: 23 min. Arrive 1:20 PM. Wait until 1:45 PM. Meet Jessica 1:45-2:15 PM.\n\nTravel to North Beach: 24 min. Arrive 2:39 PM. Meet William 2:39-2:54 PM.\n\nTravel to Bayview: 22 min. Arrive 3:16 PM. Wait until 5:15 PM. Meet Ashley 5:15-7:00 PM.\n\nThis way, all five friends are met. Let's check the timings:\n\n1. Daniel: 9:26-11:11 (105 min)\n2. Ronald: 11:27-12:57 (90 min)\n3. Jessica: 1:45-2:15 (30 min)\n4. William: 2:39-2:54 (15 min)\n5. Ashley: 5:15-7:00 (105 min)\n\nBut wait, after Ronald ends at 12:57 PM, travel to Golden Gate Park takes 23 min, arriving at 1:20 PM. Then need to wait until 1:45 PM to meet Jessica. That's 25 minutes of waiting. Is there a way to use that time better?\n\nAlternatively, after Ronald ends at 12:57 PM, perhaps go to William first. Let's see:\n\nFrom Chinatown to North Beach is 3 min. Arrive at 1:00 PM. William is available from 1:15 PM. Wait until 1:15 PM, meet him for 15 min until 1:30 PM. Then travel to Golden Gate Park (24 min), arrive at 1:54 PM. But Jessica's window starts at 1:45 PM. So maybe meet Jessica from 1:54 PM to 2:24 PM. That's possible. Then after that, go to Bayview. Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 23 min. Arrive 2:47 PM. But Ashley is available from 5:15 PM. So that leaves a big gap again. Alternatively, after Jessica, maybe do something else. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting William at 1:30 PM, go to Golden Gate Park (24 min) arrive 1:54 PM. Then meet Jessica from 1:54 to 2:24 PM. Then travel to Bayview (23 min) arrive 2:47 PM. Still too early for Ashley. So that's the same issue.\n\nBut in this case, all friends are met. The user's goal is to meet as many as possible, so this schedule meets all five. But the waiting time is unavoidable for Ashley. So this seems to be the best possible.\n\nLet me check the travel times again to make sure:\n\nFrom Presidio to Mission District: 26 min (arrive 9:26)\nMission District to Chinatown: 16 min (arrive 11:27)\nChinatown to Golden Gate Park: 23 min (arrive 1:20)\nGolden Gate Park to North Beach: 24 min (arrive 2:39)\nNorth Beach to Bayview: 22 min (arrive 3:16)\nWait until 5:15 PM to meet Ashley.\n\nYes. Alternatively, after meeting Jessica, go directly to Bayview. From Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 23 min. So arrive at 2:15 +23=2:38 PM. Still too early. So no difference.\n\nSo the final schedule meets all five friends. Let's structure the JSON accordingly.\n\nThe itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Daniel at Mission District from 9:26 to 11:11\n2. Meet Ronald at Chinatown from 11:27 to 12:57\n3. Meet Jessica at Golden Gate Park from 13:45 to 14:15\n4. Meet William at North Beach from 14:39 to 14:54\n5. Meet Ashley at Bayview from 17:15 to 19:00\n\nWait, after meeting Ronald until 12:57, then travel to Golden Gate Park (23 min) arrives at 13:20 (1:20 PM). Then wait until 13:45 (1:45 PM) to meet Jessica. So the time from 12:57 to 13:20 is travel time (23 min). So arrival at 13:20, then wait 25 minutes. Then meet Jessica from 13:45 to 14:15 (30 min). Then travel to North Beach (24 min), arrive 14:39. Meet William until 14:54. Then travel to Bayview (22 min), arrive 15:16 (3:16 PM). Then wait until 17:15 (5:15 PM) to meet Ashley for 105 minutes until 19:00 (7:00 PM).\n\nYes, that works. So the JSON should include all these meetings.",
