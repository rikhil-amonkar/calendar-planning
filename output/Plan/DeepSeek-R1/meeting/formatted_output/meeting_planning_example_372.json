            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule meetings with as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and constraints. Starting at Sunset District at 9 AM. The friends are Charles, Margaret, Daniel, and Stephanie, each with specific availability and minimum meeting durations.\n\nFirst, let's list everyone's availability and required meeting times:\n\n- Charles: Alamo Square, 6PM-8:45PM, needs 90 minutes. So I have to meet him between 6PM and 8:45PM, but the meeting must be at least 1.5 hours. The latest we can start is 7:15 PM (since 7:15 + 1.5h = 8:45). So possible slots for Charles are 6-7:30, 6:15-7:45, etc., but must end by 8:45.\n\n- Margaret: Russian Hill, 9AM-4PM, needs 30 minutes. Since I start at Sunset at 9AM, which is 24 minutes away from Russian Hill. So earliest arrival at Russian Hill is 9:24. But Margaret is available until 4PM. So possible times after 9:24, but need to leave enough time to get to other meetings.\n\n- Daniel: Golden Gate Park, 8AM-1:30PM, needs 15 minutes. He's available until 1:30 PM. Since I start at Sunset at 9AM, which is 11 minutes to Golden Gate Park. So arrive at 9:11. Need to meet him for at least 15 minutes. His latest possible end time is 1:30 PM, so latest start is 1:15 PM. But maybe meeting him earlier would free up time for others.\n\n- Stephanie: Mission District, 8:30PM-10PM, needs 90 minutes. She's available from 8:30 PM. Must meet her for 1.5h, so latest start is 8:30 PM + 1.5h = 10PM. So she can be met starting at 8:30 PM, ending at 10 PM.\n\nBut also, need to consider travel times between locations. The main challenge is fitting all possible meetings, especially since Charles and Stephanie are in the evening. Let's see.\n\nStarting at Sunset District at 9AM. Let's check Daniel first. Since he's available until 1:30 PM, perhaps meet him early. Travel time from Sunset to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. So leaving at 9:00, arrive at 9:11. Meet Daniel for 15 minutes: 9:11 to 9:26. Then, where next? Let's see.\n\nAfter Daniel, possible next meetings. Margaret is in Russian Hill (from 9AM to 4PM). Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill is 21 minutes. So leaving Daniel at 9:26, arrive at Russian Hill at 9:47. Then meet Margaret for at least 30 minutes. So could meet from 9:47 to 10:17. That works within her availability (until 4PM). But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with Margaret. But starting at Sunset, to Russian Hill is 24 minutes. So leave at 9:00, arrive at 9:24. Meet her from 9:24 to 9:54 (30 mins). Then go to Daniel. From Russian Hill to Golden Gate Park is 19 minutes. Arrive at 10:13. Meet Daniel from 10:13 to 10:28 (15 mins). That's possible. Then after Daniel, maybe go to Alamo Square or Mission District. But Charles is in Alamo Square from 6PM. But after Daniel, it's 10:28. Let's see where else we can go. Maybe that's too early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Daniel, go to Alamo Square. Let's see. Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square is 9 minutes. So from Daniel's end at 10:28, arrive at Alamo Square at 10:37. But Charles isn't there until 6PM. So that's not helpful. So maybe after Daniel, the next step would be to go somewhere else. Wait, but Margaret is available until 4PM. Maybe after Daniel, go to Margaret? Wait, if I did Daniel first, then Margaret. Let's re-examine.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at Charles and Stephanie first because they have the latest availability and require longer meetings.\n\nCharles needs to be met at Alamo Square between 6PM and 8:45PM for 90 minutes. So schedule him first. Let's say meet Charles from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM. That uses up 6-7:30. Then, after that, need to get to Mission District for Stephanie, who is available from 8:30 PM. Travel time from Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 minutes. So leaving Alamo Square at 7:30, arrive Mission District at 7:40. But Stephanie isn't available until 8:30 PM. So that's a lot of waiting time. Alternatively, perhaps schedule Charles later. Like 7:15 PM to 8:45 PM. Then go to Mission District, which takes 10 minutes. Arrive at 8:45 + 10 = 8:55. But Stephanie starts at 8:30. So the earliest to meet Stephanie would be from 8:30 PM. So if we schedule Charles from 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM. Then travel time to Mission District is 10 minutes, arriving at 8:25 PM, but Stephanie starts at 8:30. So maybe meet Stephanie from 8:30-10:00 PM. But that's 90 minutes. So if Charles is scheduled from 6:45-8:15, then after that, go to Mission District (10 min), arriving at 8:25. Wait until 8:30, meet Stephanie until 10:00. That works. But then Charles is 6:45-8:15. However, Charles is available until 8:45, so that's possible. But the travel time from Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 minutes. So leaving Alamo Square at 8:15, arrive at 8:25. Then meet Stephanie from 8:30-10:00. That works.\n\nBut what about Margaret and Daniel? Need to fit them in before 4 PM and 1:30 PM respectively.\n\nSo starting at 9 AM in Sunset. Let's try to meet Daniel first. Sunset to Golden Gate Park is 11 min. Arrive 9:11. Meet Daniel from 9:11 to 9:26 (15 min). Then, go to Margaret in Russian Hill. Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill is 21 min. Arrive at 9:47. Meet Margaret from 9:47 to 10:17 (30 min). Then, after that, where to go? Maybe free time until 6 PM. But need to check travel time to Charles. From Russian Hill to Alamo Square is 15 min. But if we have time between 10:17 AM and 6 PM, that's a lot of time. But maybe not necessary. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meet Margaret first. Sunset to Russian Hill is 24 min, arriving at 9:24. Meet Margaret from 9:24 to 9:54 (30 min). Then go to Daniel. Russian Hill to Golden Gate Park is 21 min, arriving at 10:15. Meet Daniel from 10:15 to 10:30 (15 min). Then, after that, from Golden Gate Park, maybe go somewhere else. But the other meetings are Charles and Stephanie in the evening. So that leaves the rest of the day free until 6 PM.\n\nSo in either case, meeting Daniel and Margaret in the morning, then Charles and Stephanie in the evening. But how about the travel times between those.\n\nWait, after meeting Daniel at 10:30 AM, where to next? The next scheduled meeting would be Charles at 6 PM. So there's a gap. But perhaps that's okay. Let's see the timeline:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Start at Sunset.\n\n- 9:00-9:11: Travel to Golden Gate Park.\n\n- 9:11-9:26: Meet Daniel (15 mins).\n\n- 9:26-9:47: Travel to Russian Hill (21 mins).\n\n- 9:47-10:17: Meet Margaret (30 mins).\n\n- 10:17 AM to 6:00 PM: Free time. Then need to go to Alamo Square for Charles.\n\nTravel time from Russian Hill to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leaving Russian Hill at, say, 5:45 PM, arrive at Alamo Square at 6:00 PM. Then meet Charles from 6:00-7:30 PM. Then, from Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 minutes, arriving at 7:40 PM. But Stephanie is available from 8:30 PM. So wait from 7:40 PM to 8:30 PM (50 mins). Then meet Stephanie from 8:30-10:00 PM.\n\nThat works. But the free time is quite long. Alternatively, maybe adjust Charles's meeting time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps meet Charles from 7:15 PM to 8:45 PM. Then after that, go to Mission District (10 mins), arriving at 8:55 PM. But Stephanie starts at 8:30 PM, so that's a conflict. So perhaps meet Stephanie from 8:30-10:00 PM. To do that, need to be at Mission District by 8:30 PM. So from Charles's meeting, if he's scheduled until 8:45 PM, but then travel time is 10 mins, arriving at 8:55 PM, which is after Stephanie's start time. So that's a problem. Therefore, Charles needs to end by 8:35 PM to leave time to travel to Mission District by 8:45. But Stephanie's meeting requires 90 mins. So Stephanie's meeting would have to start by 8:30 PM, end at 10:00 PM. So the latest we can arrive at Mission District is 8:30 PM. Therefore, Charles's meeting must end by 8:30 PM minus travel time. Travel from Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 mins. So leave Alamo Square by 8:20 PM to arrive at 8:30 PM. Therefore, Charles's meeting must end by 8:20 PM. But Charles is available until 8:45 PM. So if the meeting with Charles is from 6:50 PM to 8:20 PM (90 mins), then leave at 8:20, arrive at Mission District at 8:30, meet Stephanie until 10:00 PM. That works. So Charles's meeting would be 6:50-8:20 PM.\n\nBut how do we schedule that?\n\nLet's build the itinerary step by step.\n\nStart at Sunset at 9 AM.\n\nOption:\n\n1. Meet Daniel first.\n\n- 9:00 AM: Depart Sunset.\n\n- 9:11 AM: Arrive Golden Gate Park.\n\n- 9:11-9:26 AM: Meet Daniel (15 mins).\n\n- 9:26 AM: Depart Golden Gate Park.\n\n- 9:26 + 21 mins = 9:47 AM: Arrive Russian Hill.\n\n- 9:47-10:17 AM: Meet Margaret (30 mins).\n\n- 10:17 AM: Depart Russian Hill.\n\nNow, from 10:17 AM to 6:50 PM (when Charles's meeting starts), there's a lot of time. But need to get to Alamo Square by 6:50 PM. Travel time from Russian Hill to Alamo Square is 15 mins. So leave Russian Hill by 6:35 PM. But between 10:17 AM and 6:35 PM, there's 8 hours and 18 minutes. That's a lot of free time. Maybe that's acceptable.\n\nSo:\n\n- 10:17 AM: Depart Russian Hill. But where to go? Maybe stay in Russian Hill until needed. Wait, but maybe travel to Alamo Square later. Let's say after meeting Margaret, you have free time until you need to go to Alamo Square for Charles. Let's calculate the latest departure time to reach Alamo Square by 6:50 PM. Travel time is 15 mins from Russian Hill. So leave Russian Hill at 6:35 PM. But why stay in Russian Hill? Maybe go somewhere else, but the other locations are not needed until later. So maybe the schedule is:\n\nAfter meeting Margaret at 10:17 AM, you can stay in Russian Hill until 6:35 PM, then leave for Alamo Square. But that's a lot of waiting. Alternatively, maybe go to another location but there's no other meetings. So perhaps that's unavoidable. Alternatively, maybe adjust the order of meetings to minimize waiting time.\n\nAlternative approach: After meeting Daniel and Margaret, perhaps go to Alamo Square early and wait there until Charles's meeting. But Alamo Square to Alamo Square is same place. Wait, no. So after meeting Margaret, you could go to Alamo Square earlier, but Charles isn't available until 6 PM. So arrival at Alamo Square would be after 10:17 AM plus travel time. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting Margaret at 10:17 AM, travel to Alamo Square from Russian Hill takes 15 mins. Arrive at 10:32 AM. Then wait until 6 PM. That's 7.5 hours of waiting. Not efficient. So that's not good.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a better way. Let's consider meeting Margaret first, then Daniel.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Depart Sunset for Russian Hill (24 mins), arrive 9:24 AM.\n\n- 9:24-9:54 AM: Meet Margaret (30 mins).\n\n- 9:54 AM: Depart Russian Hill for Golden Gate Park (21 mins), arrive 10:15 AM.\n\n- 10:15-10:30 AM: Meet Daniel (15 mins).\n\n- 10:30 AM: Depart Golden Gate Park.\n\nThen, where to go? Maybe go to Alamo Square early. From Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square is 9 mins. Arrive 10:39 AM. But Charles isn't available until 6 PM. So you wait until 6 PM, which is 7 hours and 21 minutes. Not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Daniel, go somewhere else. But the other meetings are in the evening. So this seems unavoidable. But perhaps use that time to do something else, but the problem is just to meet friends. So maybe the schedule would have a lot of waiting time. However, the goal is to meet as many friends as possible, which in this case is all four if possible.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Margaret: 9:24-9:54 AM.\n\n2. Meet Daniel: 10:15-10:30 AM.\n\n3. Meet Charles: 6:50-8:20 PM.\n\n4. Meet Stephanie: 8:30-10:00 PM.\n\nBut need to account for travel times between each step.\n\nWait, after meeting Daniel at 10:30 AM, the next meeting is Charles at 6:50 PM. So there's a gap. The user is in Golden Gate Park after meeting Daniel. They need to get to Alamo Square by 6:50 PM. Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square is 9 mins. So leaving Golden Gate Park at 6:41 PM. But why wait until then? Because Charles's meeting starts at 6 PM. But the meeting is scheduled from 6:50 PM. Wait, no. Charles is available from 6 PM. So maybe meet Charles earlier, like 6:00-7:30 PM. Then, after that, go to Mission District.\n\nBut let's rework the schedule.\n\nAlternative itinerary:\n\nStart at Sunset (9 AM).\n\n- Travel to Russian Hill (24 mins): 9:00-9:24 AM.\n\n- Meet Margaret 9:24-9:54 AM.\n\n- Travel to Golden Gate Park (21 mins): 9:54-10:15 AM.\n\n- Meet Daniel 10:15-10:30 AM.\n\n- Then, free time until Charles's meeting.\n\nTo meet Charles at Alamo Square, need to travel from Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square (9 mins). Let's say leave Golden Gate Park at 5:51 PM to arrive at Alamo Square at 6:00 PM.\n\n- Meet Charles 6:00-7:30 PM.\n\n- Travel to Mission District (10 mins): 7:30-7:40 PM.\n\nBut Stephanie is available from 8:30 PM. So need to wait from 7:40 to 8:30 PM (50 mins). Then meet Stephanie 8:30-10:00 PM.\n\nThis works. But there's a 50-minute gap between Charles and Stephanie. Alternatively, adjust Charles's meeting to later to reduce waiting time.\n\nIf Charles is met from 7:15-8:45 PM, then after that, travel to Mission District (10 mins), arriving at 8:55 PM. But Stephanie is available from 8:30 PM. So Stephanie's meeting could start at 8:55 PM, but she needs 90 minutes, which would end at 10:25 PM. But Stephanie is available until 10:00 PM. So that's impossible. Therefore, Stephanie must be met by 8:30 PM to end by 10:00 PM. So the latest start time for Stephanie is 8:30 PM, ending at 10:00 PM. Therefore, Charles must end by 8:30 PM minus travel time (10 mins) = 8:20 PM. So Charles's meeting must end by 8:20 PM. Therefore, Charles's meeting must start at 6:50 PM (90 minutes prior) and end at 8:20 PM. Then travel to Mission District, arriving at 8:30 PM, meeting Stephanie until 10:00 PM.\n\nSo the schedule would be:\n\n- 9:00 AM: Start at Sunset.\n\n- 9:24 AM: Arrive Russian Hill. Meet Margaret 9:24-9:54 AM.\n\n- 10:15 AM: Arrive Golden Gate Park. Meet Daniel 10:15-10:30 AM.\n\n- Then, travel to Alamo Square by 6:50 PM. Let's calculate the travel time from Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square is 9 mins. So leave Golden Gate Park at 6:41 PM, arrive at 6:50 PM. But that's a long time between 10:30 AM and 6:41 PM. So that's 8 hours and 11 minutes of free time. Not ideal, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting Daniel, go somewhere else. But no other meetings are scheduled. So this seems unavoidable. Therefore, the itinerary is possible but with a lot of waiting.\n\nSo the final schedule would be:\n\n1. Meet Margaret: 9:24-9:54 AM at Russian Hill.\n\n2. Meet Daniel: 10:15-10:30 AM at Golden Gate Park.\n\n3. Meet Charles: 6:50-8:20 PM at Alamo Square.\n\n4. Meet Stephanie: 8:30-10:00 PM at Mission District.\n\nNow, check travel times between each step.\n\nBetween Daniel and Charles:\n\nAfter meeting Daniel at 10:30 AM, the next meeting is Charles at 6:50 PM. Travel from Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square is 9 mins. So leave Golden Gate Park at 6:41 PM, arrive at 6:50 PM. That works.\n\nBetween Charles and Stephanie:\n\nTravel from Alamo Square to Mission District is 10 mins. Leave at 8:20 PM, arrive at 8:30 PM. Meet Stephanie until 10:00 PM. Perfect.\n\nNow, check the initial travels:\n\nSunset to Russian Hill: 24 mins (9:00-9:24 AM). Correct.\n\nRussian Hill to Golden Gate Park: 21 mins (9:54-10:15 AM). Correct.\n\nGolden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 9 mins (6:41-6:50 PM). Correct.\n\nAlamo Square to Mission District: 10 mins (8:20-8:30 PM). Correct.\n\nAll required meetings are scheduled with sufficient time, meeting the minimum durations. All friends are met. This seems optimal.",
