            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and constraints. Let me start by listing all the constraints and then figure out the best order to visit everyone.\n\nFirst, the arrival is at Presidio at 9:00 AM. The friends are:\n\n1. Jason: Richmond District, available 1:00 PM to 8:45 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n2. Melissa: North Beach, 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n3. Brian: Financial District, 9:45 AM to 9:45 PM, 15 minutes.\n4. Elizabeth: Golden Gate Park, 8:45 AM to 9:30 PM, 105 minutes.\n5. Laura: Union Square, 2:15 PM to 7:30 PM, 75 minutes.\n\nTravel times are given between each location. Let's see the order. Since Elizabeth is available from early morning and needs the longest time (105 minutes), maybe starting with her makes sense. But wait, we start at Presidio at 9 AM. The travel time from Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 12 minutes. So arriving there at 9:12 AM. Elizabeth is available from 8:45 AM, so that's okay. Let's allocate her time first.\n\nBut wait, Brian is available starting at 9:45 AM. Since he's in Financial District, maybe meeting him early could be better. Let's check the travel time from Presidio to Financial District: 23 minutes. If we leave Presidio at 9 AM, we arrive at Financial District at 9:23 AM. But Brian is only available from 9:45 AM. So if we go to Financial District first, we'd have to wait until 9:45 AM. Alternatively, go to Golden Gate Park first. Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 12 minutes, arriving at 9:12. Then meet Elizabeth from 9:12 to, say, 11:00 AM (108 minutes, which meets her 105-minute minimum). That works. Then from Golden Gate Park, where to next?\n\nAfter Elizabeth, next possible is Brian. From Golden Gate Park to Financial District is 26 minutes. So leaving at 11:00, arrive at Financial District at 11:26 AM. Meet Brian for 15 minutes (11:26-11:41). But Brian's time is flexible, so maybe that's okay. Then from Financial District to Laura's Union Square. Travel time is 9 minutes. If we leave Financial District at 11:41, arrive Union Square at 11:50. But Laura is available from 2:15 PM. So that's too early. So maybe Laura can't be met until after 2:15 PM. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, go to Laura's Union Square. But Laura is available from 2:15 PM. Let's see. After Elizabeth ends at 11:00 AM, maybe go to Jason in Richmond District. Let's check. Golden Gate Park to Richmond District is 7 minutes. So arrive at 11:07 AM. But Jason is available only from 1 PM. So that's too early. So maybe after Elizabeth, go somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, maybe go to Brian. Let's proceed as before. After meeting Brian at 11:26-11:41, then maybe have lunch or something until Laura's available at 2:15 PM. But that's a long gap. Maybe not efficient. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative plan: Start with Brian. Since he's available from 9:45 AM. Leave Presidio at 9 AM, arrive Financial District at 9:23 AM. Wait until 9:45 AM. Then meet Brian from 9:45 to 10:00 AM (15 mins). Then travel from Financial District to Golden Gate Park. Travel time is 23 minutes. Arrive at 10:23 AM. Meet Elizabeth from 10:23 AM to 12:08 PM (105 mins). Then from Golden Gate Park to Richmond District (7 mins) to meet Jason. Arrive at 12:15 PM. But Jason is available from 1 PM. So again, need to wait. So maybe meet Jason starting at 1 PM. Then from 1 PM to 2:30 PM (90 mins). Then from Richmond District to Union Square. Travel time is 21 mins. Arrive at 2:51 PM. But Laura is available from 2:15 PM. So meeting Laura from 2:51 PM to 4:06 PM (75 mins). Then from Union Square to North Beach (10 mins) to meet Melissa. Arrive at 4:16 PM. But Melissa is available from 6:45 PM. So that's too early. Hmm. So this plan has gaps and misses Melissa.\n\nAlternatively, after Laura, we can go to Melissa in North Beach. But Melissa's time is 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM. So let's see. Let's adjust the schedule.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's list all the friends with their time windows and required durations:\n\n- Elizabeth: Golden Gate Park, 8:45 AM -9:30 PM, 105 mins. Needs the longest time, so probably best to schedule her first.\n\n- Brian: Financial District, 9:45 AM-9:45 PM, 15 mins. Can fit anywhere.\n\n- Jason: Richmond District, 1 PM-8:45 PM, 90 mins.\n\n- Laura: Union Square, 2:15 PM-7:30 PM, 75 mins.\n\n- Melissa: North Beach, 6:45 PM-8:15 PM, 45 mins.\n\nSo starting at Presidio at 9 AM. Let's go to Elizabeth first. Presidio to Golden Gate Park: 12 mins. Arrive 9:12 AM. Meet Elizabeth from 9:12 AM to 10:57 AM (105 mins). Then, from Golden Gate Park, where next? Let's see.\n\nAfter Elizabeth, the next earliest available is Brian (available from 9:45 AM), so we can meet Brian after Elizabeth. From Golden Gate Park to Financial District is 26 mins. Leaving at 10:57, arrive at 11:23 AM. Meet Brian from 11:23 to 11:38 AM (15 mins). Then, from Financial District, where to next? Laura is available from 2:15 PM. So maybe we can go to Laura after Brian. But there's a gap. Let's see. After Brian, we can go to Union Square. Travel time from Financial District to Union Square is 9 mins. So arrive at 11:47 AM. But Laura is available only from 2:15 PM. So we have to wait until 2:15 PM. That's a long time. Not efficient. So maybe after Brian, go to Jason in Richmond District. Let's check.\n\nFrom Financial District to Richmond District is 21 mins. Leaving at 11:38, arrive at 12:00 PM. Jason is available from 1 PM. So wait until 1 PM. Meet Jason from 1 PM to 2:30 PM (90 mins). Then from Richmond District to Union Square is 21 mins. Arrive at 2:51 PM. But Laura is available from 2:15 PM. So can we arrive earlier? If we leave Jason at 2:30 PM, arrive at Union Square at 2:51 PM. Then meet Laura from 2:51 PM to 4:06 PM (75 mins). Then from Union Square to North Beach (10 mins). Arrive at 4:16 PM. But Melissa isn't available until 6:45 PM. So that's a gap again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Jason, maybe go to Melissa first? Wait, no, Melissa's time is 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM. Let's see. After Laura, we can schedule Melissa. Let's adjust:\n\nAfter Laura ends at 4:06 PM, the next step would be to go to North Beach. Travel time from Union Square to North Beach is 10 mins. Arrive at 4:16 PM. But Melissa is only available from 6:45 PM. So again, wait. That's a long wait. Maybe not feasible. So perhaps we need to find a way to fit Melissa in the evening.\n\nAlternative plan: After meeting Elizabeth, then Brian, then Laura, then Jason, then Melissa.\n\nWait, but Laura's available until 7:30 PM. Let's try:\n\nElizabeth: 9:12 AM to 10:57 AM.\n\nBrian: 11:23 AM to 11:38 AM.\n\nThen Laura: Let's see. From Financial District to Union Square is 9 mins. So leave Brian at 11:38, arrive at 11:47 AM. But Laura is available from 2:15 PM. So wait until 2:15 PM. That's two and a half hours of waiting. Not good. So maybe instead, after Brian, go to another location.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, go to Laura first, but Laura isn't available until 2:15 PM. Let's see:\n\nElizabeth ends at 10:57 AM. Then travel to Laura's location (Union Square). Golden Gate Park to Union Square is 22 mins. Arrive at 11:19 AM. But Laura is available from 2:15 PM. So need to wait. Not efficient.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key is to fit Jason, Laura, and Melissa in the afternoon/evening.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's start with Elizabeth, then Brian, then Laura, then Jason, then Melissa.\n\nElizabeth: 9:12 AM-10:57 AM.\n\nBrian: After Elizabeth, go to Financial District. Travel time 26 mins. Arrive 11:23 AM. Meet Brian 11:23-11:38.\n\nThen from Financial District to Union Square: 9 mins. Arrive 11:47 AM. Wait until 2:15 PM. Not great.\n\nAlternatively, after Brian, go to Jason. Financial District to Richmond District: 21 mins. Arrive 11:59 AM. Wait until 1 PM. Meet Jason 1-2:30 PM. Then go to Laura. Richmond District to Union Square: 21 mins. Arrive 2:51 PM. Meet Laura 2:51-4:06 PM. Then go to Melissa. Union Square to North Beach: 10 mins. Arrive 4:16 PM. Wait until 6:45 PM. That's a 2.5-hour wait. That's not good. So maybe after Laura, use the time to meet Melissa later.\n\nAlternatively, can we meet Laura first after Brian?\n\nAlternatively, after Brian (11:38 AM), go to Golden Gate Park again? No, already met Elizabeth.\n\nWait, maybe after Elizabeth, go to Golden Gate Park to Richmond District (7 mins). Then meet Jason starting at 1 PM. But Golden Gate Park to Richmond District is 7 mins. So leaving Golden Gate Park at 10:57 AM, arrive at 11:04 AM. Wait until 1 PM (which is 1h56m). Not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, after Elizabeth, go to Union Square (22 mins from Golden Gate Park). Arrive 11:19 AM. Wait until 2:15 PM. Again, long wait.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's think about the latest possible times.\n\nMelissa must be met between 6:45 PM and 8:15 PM for 45 minutes. So latest start time is 7:30 PM (ends at 8:15 PM).\n\nLaura must be met by 7:30 PM. Her time ends at 7:30 PM. So latest start time is 6:15 PM (75 mins ends at 7:30 PM).\n\nJason is available until 8:45 PM, needs 90 mins. Latest start time is 7:15 PM (ends at 8:45 PM).\n\nSo if we prioritize Melissa and Laura in the evening, but also need to fit Jason.\n\nPerhaps the optimal schedule is:\n\nStart with Elizabeth (9:12-10:57 AM).\n\nThen go to Brian (Financial District): 26 mins travel, arrive 11:23 AM, meet 11:23-11:38 AM.\n\nThen go to Union Square to meet Laura. Travel from Financial District to Union Square is 9 mins. Arrive 11:47 AM. Wait until 2:15 PM. That's a long wait, but perhaps unavoidable. Then meet Laura from 2:15 PM to 3:30 PM (75 mins).\n\nThen from Union Square to Richmond District (20 mins travel). Arrive 3:50 PM. Meet Jason from 3:50 PM to 5:20 PM (90 mins).\n\nThen from Richmond District to North Beach (17 mins). Arrive 5:37 PM. But Melissa is available from 6:45 PM. So wait until 6:45 PM. Meet Melissa from 6:45 PM to 7:30 PM (45 mins).\n\nDoes this work?\n\nWait, let's check the times:\n\nElizabeth: 9:12 AM - 10:57 AM.\n\nTravel to Financial District: 26 mins. Arrive 11:23 AM.\n\nMeet Brian: 11:23 AM - 11:38 AM.\n\nTravel to Union Square: 9 mins. Arrive 11:47 AM. Wait until 2:15 PM (2h28m wait. Not ideal, but perhaps necessary).\n\nMeet Laura: 2:15 PM - 3:30 PM.\n\nTravel to Richmond District: 20 mins. Arrive 3:50 PM.\n\nMeet Jason: 3:50 PM -5:20 PM (90 mins).\n\nTravel to North Beach: 17 mins. Arrive 5:37 PM. Wait until 6:45 PM (1h8m). Then meet Melissa 6:45 PM -7:30 PM.\n\nTotal meetings: Elizabeth, Brian, Laura, Jason, Melissa. All five. That's possible. But the wait times are long, but maybe unavoidable. However, the constraints require meeting as many as possible. So this schedule meets all five friends. But let's check travel times and overlaps.\n\nWait, when meeting Laura from 2:15 PM to 3:30 PM, travel to Richmond District takes 20 mins, arriving 3:50 PM. Then Jason's available until 8:45 PM, so meeting from 3:50 PM to 5:20 PM is okay. Then travel to North Beach (17 mins) arrives 5:37 PM. Wait until 6:45 PM. Then meet Melissa until 7:30 PM. Then the day ends there. That works.\n\nBut the long wait between Brian and Laura (11:38 AM to 2:15 PM) is a problem. Is there a way to fill that time? Maybe meet someone else, but all other friends aren't available. Jason is available from 1 PM. Maybe after Brian, go to Jason first, then Laura.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nElizabeth: 9:12 AM -10:57 AM.\n\nTravel to Financial District (26 mins): arrive 11:23 AM. Meet Brian 11:23-11:38.\n\nThen go to Jason. Financial District to Richmond District: 22 mins. Arrive 12:00 PM. But Jason is available from 1 PM. Wait until 1 PM. Meet Jason 1-2:30 PM.\n\nThen travel to Union Square: 21 mins. Arrive 2:51 PM. Laura is available until 7:30 PM. Meet Laura from 2:51 PM to 4:06 PM (75 mins).\n\nThen travel to North Beach: 10 mins. Arrive 4:16 PM. Wait until 6:45 PM. Meet Melissa 6:45-7:30 PM.\n\nThis way, the wait after Brian is from 11:38 AM to 1 PM (1h22m), which is better than 2h28m. Let's check:\n\nAfter Brian ends at 11:38 AM, travel to Richmond District takes 22 mins, arriving at 12:00 PM. Wait until 1 PM (1 hour). Then meet Jason 1-2:30 PM. Then to Union Square (21 mins), arrive 2:51 PM. Laura from 2:51-4:06 PM. Then to North Beach (10 mins), arrive 4:16 PM. Wait until 6:45 PM (2h29m). So the total waiting time is split between after Brian and before Melissa. But this allows meeting all five friends. But the wait before Melissa is long. But maybe that's unavoidable.\n\nAlternatively, after Laura, go to Melissa earlier, but she's not available. So this might be the best possible.\n\nAnother option: after Laura (ends at 4:06 PM), can we meet Jason? Laura is at Union Square. Jason is at Richmond District. Travel time from Union Square to Richmond District is 20 mins. Arrive 4:26 PM. Jason is available until 8:45 PM. So meet Jason from 4:26 PM to 5:56 PM (90 mins). Then from Richmond District to North Beach (17 mins). Arrive 6:13 PM. Wait until 6:45 PM. Meet Melissa 6:45-7:30 PM. This way, the wait after Laura is shorter.\n\nLet's try this:\n\nElizabeth: 9:12-10:57 AM.\n\nBrian: 11:23-11:38 AM.\n\nLaura: 2:15-3:30 PM (assuming travel from Brian's location to Laura's is possible after waiting).\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate this path.\n\nElizabeth from 9:12-10:57 AM. Travel to Financial District (26 mins): arrive 11:23 AM. Meet Brian 11:23-11:38 AM. Then, need to wait until Laura's availability at 2:15 PM. So from 11:38 AM to 2:15 PM, that's 2h37m. Can we use this time to meet Jason?\n\nBut Jason is available from 1 PM. So maybe:\n\nAfter Brian (11:38 AM), go to Richmond District. Financial District to Richmond District is 22 mins. Arrive 12:00 PM. Wait until 1 PM. Meet Jason 1-2:30 PM. Then go to Laura. Richmond District to Union Square is 21 mins. Arrive 2:51 PM. Meet Laura 2:51-4:06 PM. Then to North Beach (10 mins) arrive 4:16 PM. Wait until 6:45 PM. Meet Melissa 6:45-7:30 PM.\n\nThis way, after Brian, the wait is 1h (12:00-1 PM). Then meet Jason, then Laura, then Melissa. This seems better.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Elizabeth at Golden Gate Park from 9:12 AM to 10:57 AM.\n\n2. Travel to Financial District (26 mins): arrive 11:23 AM.\n\n3. Meet Brian from 11:23 AM to 11:38 AM.\n\n4. Travel to Richmond District (22 mins): arrive 12:00 PM.\n\n5. Wait until 1:00 PM, then meet Jason from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.\n\n6. Travel to Union Square (21 mins): arrive 2:51 PM.\n\n7. Meet Laura from 2:51 PM to 4:06 PM.\n\n8. Travel to North Beach (10 mins): arrive 4:16 PM.\n\n9. Wait until 6:45 PM, then meet Melissa from 6:45 PM to 7:30 PM.\n\nThis way, all five friends are met, and the waits are minimized as much as possible. Let's verify the travel times:\n\n- Presidio to Golden Gate Park: 12 mins. 9:00 AM departure, arrive 9:12 AM. Correct.\n\n- Golden Gate Park to Financial District: 26 mins. Departure at 10:57 AM, arrive 11:23 AM. Correct.\n\n- Financial District to Richmond District: 22 mins. Departure at 11:38 AM, arrive 12:00 PM.
