            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. So, the user wants to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and constraints. They start at Presidio at 9:00 AM. Let's look at all the constraints and see how to fit everyone in.\n\nFirst, let's list all the people and their availability:\n\n- Kevin: Pacific Heights, 7:15-8:45 AM (needs 90 minutes). Wait, but the user arrives at Presidio at 9:00 AM. Kevin's time is before that. So can't meet Kevin. Because the user is only available from 9 AM onwards. So Kevin is out. Hmm, maybe a mistake here? The user arrives at Presidio at 9 AM, but Kevin is available until 8:45 AM. So maybe Kevin can't be met. So no Kevin in the itinerary.\n\n- Michelle: Golden Gate Park, 8:00-9:00 PM (15 min). So possible.\n\n- Emily: Fisherman's Wharf, 4:15-7:00 PM (30 min).\n\n- Mark: Marina District, 6:15-7:45 PM (75 min). Needs 1h15m.\n\n- Barbara: Alamo Square, 5:00-7:00 PM (120 min). But her time window is 2 hours, and the user needs 120 minutes. So she must be there from 5-7 PM. But travel time to get there?\n\n- Laura: Sunset District, 7:00-9:15 PM (75 min). Needs 1h15m. But Michelle is at Golden Gate Park until 9 PM. So Laura's time starts at 7 PM. Maybe possible after Mark or Barbara.\n\n- Mary: Nob Hill, 5:30-7:00 PM (45 min). Her window is 1.5 hours, needs 45 minutes.\n\n- Helen: North Beach, 11:00 AM-12:15 PM (45 min). So possible in the morning.\n\nSo the user starts at Presidio at 9 AM. Let's see the possible order.\n\nFirst, Helen is available in the morning. North Beach is 18 minutes from Presidio (travel time). Let's check. If they leave Presidio at 9 AM, arrive at North Beach at 9:18 AM. But Helen's available from 11 AM. Oh, wait, no. Wait, Helen's time is 11:00 AM to 12:15 PM. So earliest meeting is 11:00 AM. So maybe schedule Helen first.\n\nWait, but user is starting at Presidio at 9 AM. So from 9 AM until 11 AM, there's 2 hours. Could they meet someone else in between? Let's see. Are there others available in the morning? Let's check all friends:\n\nMichelle is evening. Emily is afternoon. Mark is evening. Barbara is evening. Laura is evening. Mary is evening. Helen is 11 AM. So only Helen in the morning.\n\nSo maybe schedule Helen first. Let's plan Helen from 11 AM. But need to travel from Presidio to North Beach. Travel time is 18 minutes. So if they leave Presidio at, say, 10:42 AM, arrive at 11:00 AM. But Helen's available starting at 11:00 AM, so the earliest possible start is 11:00 AM. They need 45 minutes with Helen. So 11:00 AM to 11:45 AM. Then after that, next meeting.\n\nAfter Helen, maybe check next availability. Let's see the next group in the afternoon and evening.\n\nNext, Barbara at Alamo Square from 5-7 PM, needs 120 minutes. So the entire time slot. But Barbara's slot is exactly 2 hours, which matches the required 120 minutes. So must be there from 5-7 PM. But how to get there from previous location.\n\nBut wait, Barbara's time is 5-7 PM. Let's see. If the user is meeting Helen until 11:45 AM, then the next possible meeting before Barbara would be in the afternoon. Let's check if there's anyone else available in the afternoon before 5 PM.\n\nLooking at others:\n\nEmily at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:15 PM to 7 PM (needs 30 min). Mary at Nob Hill from 5:30 PM to 7 PM (needs 45 min). Mark at Marina District from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM (75 min). Laura from 7 PM to 9:15 PM. Michelle at 8 PM.\n\nSo between 11:45 AM and 5 PM, maybe there's time to meet someone else. Let's check:\n\nIs there anyone available? Let's see:\n\nAfter Helen (11:45 AM) until 5 PM, the user has time. Let's see if they can meet someone else here. But none of the friends are available during that time except maybe Barbara at 5 PM. But Barbara's meeting is from 5-7 PM. So maybe after Helen, the user has free time until 5 PM. But that's a long gap. Maybe they can meet Emily in the afternoon? Emily is available from 4:15 PM. So maybe after Helen, the user can schedule other meetings leading up to Barbara.\n\nWait, but Barbara requires the entire 5-7 PM slot. Let's plan Barbara first. Let's say Barbara is from 5-7 PM. To get to Alamo Square, the previous location would be North Beach (Helen's location). From North Beach to Alamo Square: travel time is 16 minutes (from North Beach to Alamo Square). So leaving Helen's location at 11:45 AM, but Barbara's meeting is at 5 PM. That's a lot of time in between. Maybe the user can meet others in between.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can schedule Barbara first. Wait, Barbara's time is 5-7 PM, and the user needs to be there for exactly 2 hours. So that's fixed. Let's see:\n\nAfter Helen (11:45 AM), next possible meeting could be Emily in Fisherman's Wharf from 4:15 PM. But from 11:45 AM to 4:15 PM is 4.5 hours. Maybe the user can fit another meeting here. Let's check if there's any friend available during that time.\n\nLooking at the friends again:\n\nHelen is done at 11:45 AM. The next earliest is Emily at 4:15 PM. So between 11:45 AM and 4:15 PM, can they meet someone else? Let's see. All other friends are available in the evening. So no. So the user has that time free. So maybe they can travel from North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Emily. Let's see:\n\nFrom North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: travel time is 5 minutes (since Fisherman's Wharf to North Beach is 6, but the reverse? Wait, the table says Fisherman's Wharf to North Beach is 6, so North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf would be 6? Wait, the data provided is all directional. Let me check the given travel times. For example, \"North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: 5.\" Yes, in the list: North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf: 5 minutes. So from North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf is 5 minutes.\n\nSo after meeting Helen at North Beach until 11:45 AM, the user could leave at 11:45 AM and travel to Fisherman's Wharf, arriving at 11:50 AM. But Emily is available only from 4:15 PM. So that's a problem. So Emily isn't available until 4:15 PM. So maybe the user can't meet Emily before 4:15 PM. So that time is free. Alternatively, maybe go to another location.\n\nWait, but Barbara is at Alamo Square from 5-7 PM. So the user has to be there by 5 PM. Let's plan Barbara's meeting first. So Barbara from 5-7 PM. To get there, the user needs to arrive by 5 PM. Let's see where they are before that. Let's backtrack.\n\nIf Barbara is from 5-7 PM at Alamo Square, then the user must be there by 5 PM. Let's say they arrive at 5 PM. The previous location could be somewhere else. Let's say before that, they meet Emily. Emily is available from 4:15 PM. Let's see:\n\nIf the user meets Emily from 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM (30 minutes), then they need to travel to Alamo Square by 5 PM. Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square is 21 minutes. So leaving Fisherman's Wharf at 4:45 PM, arrives at Alamo Square at 5:06 PM. Which is after 5 PM. So that's too late. Barbara's meeting starts at 5 PM. So that's a problem. So they need to arrive at Alamo Square by 5 PM. So maybe they can't meet Emily before Barbara. Unless they leave Emily earlier. But Emily's earliest start is 4:15 PM. Let's see:\n\nIf Emily's meeting is from 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM. Then travel to Alamo Square takes 21 minutes. So arrival at 5:06 PM. Which is 6 minutes late. Barbara's meeting starts at 5 PM. So that's a conflict. So perhaps Emily can't be met before Barbara.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe meet Barbara from 5-7 PM, then after that, go to Mark (Marina District 6:15-7:45 PM). But Barbara's meeting ends at 7 PM. Mark's time is until 7:45 PM. So after Barbara, the user can go to Mark. Let's check travel time from Alamo Square to Marina District: 15 minutes. So leaving Alamo Square at 7 PM, arrives at Marina District at 7:15 PM. Mark's available until 7:45 PM. Needs 75 minutes (1h15m). From 7:15 PM to 7:45 PM is 30 minutes. Not enough. So can't meet Mark after Barbara.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Mark before Barbara. Let's see. Mark is at Marina District from 6:15-7:45 PM. Needs 75 minutes. So if they meet Mark from 6:15 to 7:30 PM (75 minutes), then need to go to Barbara at Alamo Square by 5 PM? That's conflicting. No, Barbara's meeting is 5-7 PM. So Mark's time is after Barbara's. So conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Barbara's meeting is 5-7 PM, then after 7 PM, the user can meet Laura (Sunset District, 7-9:15 PM, needs 75 min) or Michelle (Golden Gate Park, 8-9 PM, needs 15 min). Let's see.\n\nAfter Barbara, at 7 PM, travel from Alamo Square to Sunset District. Travel time is 16 minutes. So arrive at 7:16 PM. Laura needs 75 minutes. So 7:16 PM to 8:31 PM. Then travel to Michelle's location (Golden Gate Park) which is 10 minutes away (Sunset District to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes). So arrive at 8:42 PM. Michelle is available until 9 PM. So 8:42 PM to 9 PM is 18 minutes. Enough for 15 minutes. So Michelle could be met from 8:42-8:57 PM, then leave. Then maybe Laura from 7:16-8:31 PM. But Laura's availability starts at 7 PM. So starting at 7:16 PM is possible. So that's 75 minutes. So Laura could be from 7:16-8:31 PM. Then Michelle from 8:42-8:57 PM. That works.\n\nBut Barbara's meeting is from 5-7 PM. So how to fit others before Barbara.\n\nAlternatively, before Barbara, maybe meet Mary at Nob Hill. Mary is available from 5:30-7 PM, needs 45 minutes. So if the user is at Barbara's from 5-7 PM, Mary's slot is during Barbara's time. So conflicting. So can't meet Mary then.\n\nSo maybe Mary has to be scheduled after Barbara? No, because Mary is available until 7 PM. After Barbara's meeting ends at 7 PM, Mary's time is already over. So Mary's slot is 5:30-7 PM, but Barbara is 5-7 PM. So overlapping. So the user can't meet Mary during Barbara's time.\n\nSo maybe Mary is not possible. Unless the user leaves Barbara's meeting early. But Barbara requires 120 minutes. So the user has to be there the entire time. So Mary can't be met.\n\nSo possible people to meet: Helen, Barbara, Laura, Michelle. Then what about Emily and Mark?\n\nEmily is available from 4:15 PM. Let's see. If before Barbara's meeting at 5 PM, can the user meet Emily?\n\nSo after Helen (11:45 AM), the user has from 11:45 AM to 5 PM. Let's see if they can fit Emily in that time. Emily's earliest is 4:15 PM. So maybe:\n\nFrom Helen (11:45 AM) to 4:15 PM, that's 4.5 hours. So the user can do other things. But where? Maybe travel to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Emily from 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM. Then travel to Alamo Square for Barbara at 5 PM. Let's check travel times.\n\nFrom North Beach (Helen's location) to Fisherman's Wharf is 5 minutes. So leave North Beach at 4:10 PM (to arrive at 4:15 PM). So the user can meet Emily from 4:15-4:45 PM. Then travel to Alamo Square: Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square is 21 minutes. So leaving at 4:45 PM, arrive at 5:06 PM. Barbara's meeting starts at 5 PM. So 6 minutes late. Can't do that. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe meet Emily after Barbara? Barbara ends at 7 PM. Emily is available until 7 PM. So Barbara's meeting ends at 7 PM. Then travel from Alamo Square to Fisherman's Wharf takes 19 minutes. So arrive at 7:19 PM. But Emily's time ends at 7 PM. So can't meet her. So Emily can't be met after Barbara.\n\nHmm. So Emily is only available until 7 PM. So the latest the user can meet Emily is 6:30 PM (30 minutes). But Barbara's meeting is until 7 PM. So overlapping again. So Emily can't be met.\n\nWhat about Mark? Mark is at Marina District from 6:15-7:45 PM. Needs 75 minutes. So if the user leaves Barbara's meeting early. But Barbara requires 120 minutes. So the user can't leave early. So Mark's time is during Barbara's meeting. So no.\n\nSo maybe Emily and Mark can't be met. So far, the user can meet Helen, Barbara, Laura, and Michelle. Let's check if others are possible.\n\nMary is at Nob Hill from 5:30-7 PM, needs 45 minutes. But Barbara is 5-7 PM. So during that time. So no. Unless there's a way to fit Mary in before Barbara. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the user tries to meet Mary from 5:30-6:15 PM (45 minutes). Then travel to Alamo Square (Barbara's location) by 6:15 PM. Travel time from Nob Hill to Alamo Square is 11 minutes. So leave Nob Hill at 6:15 PM, arrive at 6:26 PM. But Barbara's meeting starts at 5 PM. So the user is supposed to be there from 5-7 PM. So missing the first 1.5 hours. So can't do that. So Mary can't be scheduled.\n\nSo now, possible people: Helen, Barbara, Laura, Michelle. Are there others?\n\nWait, what about North Beach Helen, then maybe someone else before 5 PM? The user has from 11:45 AM to 5 PM. Any other friends available in that window? Let's see all friends' availability again:\n\n- Kevin: unavailable (morning before 9 AM)\n- Michelle: 8 PM\n- Emily: 4:15 PM onwards\n- Mark: 6:15 PM onwards\n- Barbara: 5 PM\n- Laura: 7 PM onwards\n- Mary: 5:30 PM onwards\n- Helen: 11 AM\n\nSo between 11:45 AM and 4:15 PM, no one is available. Except maybe Emily starting at 4:15 PM.\n\nSo maybe after Helen, the user can go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Emily from 4:15-4:45 PM, but then how to get to Barbara's meeting by 5 PM. As discussed earlier, travel time is 21 minutes from Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square. So arrival at 5:06 PM. Which is too late. Barbara's meeting starts at 5 PM. So can't meet Emily and Barbara.\n\nAlternative: Perhaps skip Barbara? But Barbara requires 120 minutes, and her window is exactly 2 hours, so it's possible to meet her fully. Maybe Barbara is a must-have.\n\nAlternatively, skip Emily and meet Barbara. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo itinerary so far:\n\n9:00 AM start at Presidio.\n\nMeet Helen at North Beach: 11:00-11:45 AM (needs 45 minutes). Travel time from Presidio to North Beach is 18 minutes. So leave Presidio at 10:42 AM, arrive at 11:00 AM.\n\nThen from 11:45 AM, next step is to go somewhere. But no other meetings until 5 PM. So that's a lot of free time. Maybe the user can use this time to travel to Barbara's location early? Let's see.\n\nFrom North Beach to Alamo Square is 16 minutes. So if the user leaves North Beach at 11:45 AM, arrives at Alamo Square at 12:01 PM. But Barbara is available only from 5 PM. So waiting there for 5 hours is not feasible. So the user must find something else to do.\n\nBut since no other friends are available during that time, perhaps the user can't meet anyone else. So the user has free time from 11:45 AM to 5 PM. Then meet Barbara from 5-7 PM.\n\nAfter Barbara, then meet Laura at Sunset District from 7:16-8:31 PM (75 minutes), then travel to Golden Gate Park (Michelle) at 8:42-8:57 PM (15 minutes). That works.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Helen: 11:00-11:45 AM (North Beach)\n2. Meet Barbara: 5:00-7:00 PM (Alamo Square)\n3. Meet Laura: 7:16-8:31 PM (Sunset District)\n4. Meet Michelle: 8:42-8:57 PM (Golden Gate Park)\n\nBut wait, Laura's meeting is from 7:16-8:31 PM. Then travel to Golden Gate Park: Sunset District to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes (according to the travel times: Sunset District to Golden Gate Park is 11). So leave Sunset District at 8:31 PM, arrive at Golden Gate Park at 8:42 PM. Michelle's time is 8-9 PM. So meeting from 8:42-8:57 PM (15 minutes) is possible.\n\nBut Michelle is at Golden Gate Park from 8 PM to 9 PM, so the user can meet her from 8:42 to 8:57 PM. That's okay.\n\nBut wait, Barbara's meeting is from 5-7 PM. So after that, the user travels to Laura at Sunset District. Travel time from Alamo Square to Sunset District is 16 minutes. So leave at 7 PM, arrive at 7:16 PM. Laura's available from 7 PM, so the user can start the meeting at 7:16 PM, which gives 75 minutes until 8:31 PM. Then travel to Golden Gate Park (11 minutes), arriving at 8:42 PM. Then meet Michelle until 8:57 PM (15 minutes).\n\nSo that's four meetings. But wait, can we fit more?\n\nLet's check if there's time to meet Mary or Mark.\n\nAfter meeting Michelle at 8:57 PM, Michelle's time is until 9 PM, so that's okay. Then the user's day ends. Laura's meeting ends at 8:31 PM, then Michelle's until 8:57 PM.\n\nAlternatively, could we fit Mark in somewhere?\n\nMark is at Marina District from 6:15-7:45 PM, needs 75 minutes. But Barbara's meeting is 5-7 PM. So overlapping. So impossible.\n\nEmily is available until 7 PM. If the user could meet her after Barbara, but Barbara ends at 7 PM, Emily's time is until 7 PM. So no.\n\nMary is at Nob Hill until 7 PM. So if the user could meet Mary after Barbara, but Barbara ends at 7 PM, Mary's time ends at 7 PM. So no.\n\nSo the possible meetings are Helen, Barbara, Laura, Michelle. That's four.\n\nWait, what about Mary? Mary is at Nob Hill from 5:30-7 PM, needs 45 minutes. Barbara is at Alamo Square from 5-7 PM. The user is with Barbara during that time. So Mary can't be met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can leave Barbara early to meet Mary. But Barbara needs 120 minutes. The user can't leave early. So no.\n\nSo the four meetings are possible.\n\nBut wait, what about Mark? Let me check again. Mark is at Marina District from 6:15-7:45 PM. Needs 75 minutes. The user is with Barbara from 5-7 PM. So no. Can't meet Mark.\n\nSo the maximum meetings possible are four: Helen, Barbara, Laura, Michelle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Emily before Barbara. Let's check:\n\nIf the user leaves North Beach after Helen at 11:45 AM, can they go to another location and meet someone else before Barbara. But no one is available except Emily from 4:15 PM.\n\nWait, from 11:45 AM to 4:15 PM is 4.5 hours. The user could go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Emily at 4:15 PM. So:\n\nAfter Helen, the user leaves North Beach at 11:45 AM. Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf: from North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf is 5 minutes. So arrive at 11:50 AM. But Emily is not available until 4:15 PM. So the user would have to wait until 4:15 PM. That's a long wait. But maybe they can use that time to travel elsewhere. But no other friends are available during that time.\n\nSo maybe not worth it. Alternatively, the user can spend the time traveling to Emily's location later.\n\nAlternatively, after Helen, the user can go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Emily from 4:15-4:45 PM, then travel to Barbara's location. But as previously calculated, arrival at Alamo Square at 5:06 PM, which is late. So Barbara's meeting starts at 5 PM. So the user can't be late. So Emily can't be met.\n\nSo the only possible meetings are Helen, Barbara, Laura, Michelle.\n\nBut wait, let me check travel times again to ensure accuracy.\n\nFrom Alamo Square to Sunset District is 16 minutes. So leaving at 7 PM, arrival at 7:16 PM. Laura's time starts at 7 PM. So the meeting can start at 7:16 PM, end at 8:31 PM (75 minutes). Then travel to Golden Gate Park (Sunset District to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes). Arrive at 8:42 PM. Meet Michelle from 8:42-8:57 PM. That's 15 minutes. Which meets her minimum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Michelle first, then Laura. Let's see:\n\nAfter Barbara's meeting at 7 PM, go to Golden Gate Park. Travel time from Alamo Square to Golden Gate Park is 9 minutes. So arrive at 7:09 PM. Michelle is available from 8 PM. So no, can't meet her yet. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the initial plan holds.\n\nSo the final itinerary would be:\n\n1. Helen: 11:00-11:45 AM (North Beach)\n2. Barbara: 5:00-7:00 PM (Alamo Square)\n3. Laura: 7:16-8:31 PM (Sunset District)\n4. Michelle: 8:42-8:57 PM (Golden Gate Park)\n\nNow, check if any other meetings can be fit in. For example, after Helen, before Barbara. If there's time, but no one is available.\n\nAlternatively, meet Emily after Michelle? Michelle's meeting ends at 8:57 PM. Emily is available until 7 PM. So no.\n\nSo the maximum is four meetings.\n\nBut wait, what about Mary? Let's see. After Barbara's meeting ends at 7 PM, Mary's time ends at 7 PM. So no.\n\nAlternatively, is there any other way to squeeze in another meeting?\n\nWait, after meeting Helen at 11:45 AM, the user has from 11:45 AM to 5 PM. Maybe they can meet someone else during that time. But according to the constraints, none of the friends are available during that window except Emily starting at 4:15 PM. So perhaps meet Emily from 4:15-4:45 PM, then rush to Barbara's meeting. But as discussed, arrival at 5:06 PM. Not possible. So no.\n\nAlternatively, leave Helen's meeting early? But Helen requires 45 minutes. Meeting from 11:00-11:45 AM is exactly 45 minutes. So can't leave early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust Helen's meeting time. Let's see: the user starts at Presidio at 9 AM. To meet Helen at North Beach, which is 18 minutes away. So leave Presidio at 10:42 AM to arrive at 11:00 AM. The meeting is 45 minutes until 11:45 AM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can leave Presidio earlier to meet someone else first. But Kevin's time is before 9 AM. So no.\n\nSo the initial plan stands.\n\nNow, verify all the travel times:\n\n1. Presidio to North Beach: 18 minutes. Depart 10:42 AM, arrive 11:00 AM.\n\n2. North Beach to Alamo Square: After Helen's meeting, the user has from 11:45 AM to 5 PM. But Barbara's meeting starts at 5 PM. So they need to arrive at Alamo Square by 5 PM. The travel time from North Beach to Alamo Square is 16 minutes. So they could leave North Beach at 4:44 PM to arrive at 5:00 PM. But that leaves a large gap from 11:45 AM to 4:44 PM. Not efficient. But since no other meetings are possible, that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but the user could spend the time traveling earlier. For example, they could leave North Beach at 4:44 PM to arrive at Alamo Square at 5:00 PM. But that's a lot of free time. However, the problem requires optimizing the schedule to meet as many friends as possible, but given the constraints, it's not possible to fit more. So that's acceptable.\n\n3. Alamo Square to Sunset District: 16 minutes. Depart at 7:00 PM, arrive at 7:16 PM. Meeting Laura until 8:31 PM.\n\n4. Sunset District to Golden Gate Park: 11 minutes. Depart at 8:31 PM, arrive at 8:42 PM. Meet Michelle until 8:57 PM.\n\nAll travel times are accounted for.\n\nNow, let's check if the JSON format is correct. The times should be in 24-hour format without leading zeros. For example, 11:00 AM is 11:00, 5:00 PM is 17:00, but wait, no. Wait, the example says \"e.g., '9:30' not '09:30', '13:30' not '1:30PM'\". So 5 PM should be 17:00, but according to the example, '1:30PM' should be '13:30'. So the times should use 24-hour format without leading zeros. So 5 PM is 17:00? Wait no, the example shows '13:30' for 1:30 PM. So 5 PM is 17:00. But the example also shows '9:30' which is 9:30 AM. So leading zeros are not used. So 9:30 AM is 9:30, 5:00 PM is 17:00, 7:00 PM is 19:00, etc.\n\nSo the itinerary JSON should have:\n\n- Helen: start_time \"11:00\", end_time \"11:45\"\n- Barbara: start_time \"17:00\", end_time \"19:00\"\n- Laura: start_time \"19:16\", end_time \"20:31\"\n- Michelle: start_time \"20:42\", end_time \"20:57\"\n\nWait, but 7:16 PM is 19:16, 8:31 PM is 20:31, 8:42 PM is 20:42, 8:57 PM is 20:57.\n\nYes. So the JSON should look like:\n\n[\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Helen\", \"start_time\": \"11:00\", \"end_time\": \"11:45\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"17:00\", \"end_time\": \"19:00\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Sunset District\", \"person\": \"Laura\", \"start_time\": \"19:16\", \"end_time\": \"20:31\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Golden Gate Park\", \"person\": \"Michelle\", \"start_time\": \"20:42\", \"end_time\": \"20:57\"}\n]\n\nWait, but the user starts at Presidio at 9:00 AM. The first meeting is at 11:00 AM. How do they get there? They need to depart Presidio at 10:42 AM (18 minutes travel time). But the itinerary only includes the meetings, not the travel actions. So the JSON only includes the meet actions. So the itinerary is correct.\n\nNow, check if all minimum times are met:\n\n- Helen: 45 minutes (11:00-11:45) \u2705\n- Barbara: 120 minutes (17:00-19:00) \u2705\n- Laura: 75 minutes (19:16-20:31 is 1h15m) \u2705\n- Michelle: 15 minutes (20:42-20:57) \u2705\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. This schedule meets four friends. Can we fit more?\n\nIs there any way to meet Emily or Mark?\n\nLet me think again. After meeting Michelle at 20:57, is there any other friend available? Laura's time ends at 21:15, but the user is meeting Laura until 20:31, then Michelle until 20:57. After that, Laura's time is until 21:15 PM. But the user has already met Laura. No other friends are available after 20:57.\n\nAlternatively, after Barbara's meeting, can we meet Mark? Barbara ends at 19:00. Mark is available until 19:45. Travel time from Alamo Square to Marina District is 15 minutes. So arrive at 19:15. Mark needs 75 minutes (until 19:45). So 19:15 to 19:45 is 30 minutes. Not enough. So can't meet Mark.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Emily between Helen and Barbara. Let's see:\n\nIf after Helen (11:45 AM), the user travels to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Emily at 4:15 PM. But that's a long wait. Alternatively, maybe find another friend available during that time. But no one is available.\n\nSo no. The maximum is four meetings.",
