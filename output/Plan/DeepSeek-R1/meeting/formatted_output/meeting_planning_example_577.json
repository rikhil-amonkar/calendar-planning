            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. First, I need to figure out how to meet as many friends as possible given the constraints. Let's start by listing all the people and their availability, along with the required meeting durations.\n\nThe user arrives at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. Let's look at each friend:\n\n1. **Robert** is at Nob Hill from 7:45 AM to 10:30 AM and needs 90 minutes. Since the user arrives at 9 AM, there's a window here. The earliest start time would be 9 AM, but we have to account for travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill, which is 15 minutes. Wait, no\u2014the travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill is 15 minutes? Wait, looking at the travel times: \"Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill: 15.\" So leaving at 9 AM, arrival at 9:15 AM. Robert is available until 10:30 AM. So from 9:15 to 10:30 is 1 hour 15 minutes, which is 75 minutes. But he needs 90 minutes. That's not enough. Oh, that's a problem. Wait, Robert's available until 10:30 AM. So if we start at 9:15, the meeting can go until 10:30 AM, which is 75 minutes. But the requirement is 90. Hmm. So maybe Robert isn't possible? Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again. The user arrives at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM. To get to Nob Hill, it's 15 minutes. So arrives at 9:15. Robert is available until 10:30. So the maximum time available is from 9:15 to 10:30, which is 1h15m (75 minutes). But the required minimum is 90. So Robert can't be met. Wait, that's a problem. Maybe the user can't meet Robert? But that's a constraint. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Robert's availability is 7:45 AM to 10:30 AM. The user arrives at 9 AM. So possible meeting time is 9:15 AM (after travel) to 10:30 AM. But 75 minutes, which is less than the required 90. Therefore, Robert can't be met. So maybe we have to skip Robert. But wait, maybe there's another way. Wait, is there a way to adjust the schedule? Let's think again. Alternatively, maybe the user can go to Robert first thing upon arrival. But arrival is at 9 AM. So leaving at 9 AM, takes 15 minutes to get to Nob Hill. Arrive at 9:15. Then meet until 10:45, but Robert is only available until 10:30. So that's 9:15 to 10:30 (75 minutes). Not enough. So Robert's meeting isn't possible. Therefore, the user can't meet Robert. So we have to exclude Robert. Hmm.\n\n2. **Steven** is at Golden Gate Park from 8:30 AM to 5 PM, needs 75 minutes. Since Golden Gate Park is only 7 minutes from Haight-Ashbury. The user arrives at 9 AM. So perhaps start at 9:07 (arrive at 9:07?), but actually, the user is already at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. Wait, the user is starting at Haight-Ashbury. Wait, the problem says \"You arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00AM.\" So the user is already there. So Steven is at Golden Gate Park, which is 7 minutes away. So if the user leaves at 9 AM, arrives at Golden Gate Park at 9:07. Then meet Steven from 9:07 to... 10:22 (75 minutes). That would work. Then after that, the user can go to other places. But need to check other constraints.\n\n3. **Anthony** is at Alamo Square from 7:45 AM to 7:45 PM, needs 15 minutes. Alamo Square is 5 minutes from Haight-Ashbury. So maybe fit him in before or after Steven. For example, after meeting Steven, go to Alamo Square. Or maybe squeeze in a quick meeting with Anthony first. Let's see. Starting at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. If the user goes to meet Steven first, leaving at 9 AM, arrive at 9:07, meet until 10:22. Then go to Alamo Square, which is 5 minutes from Haight-Ashbury. Wait, but after meeting Steven, the user is at Golden Gate Park. To get to Alamo Square from Golden Gate Park: the travel time is 10 minutes (Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square is 10 minutes? Wait, looking at the travel times: \"Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square: 10.\" So from Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square is 10 minutes. So leaving Steven at 10:22, arrive at Alamo Square at 10:32. Then meet Anthony for 15 minutes (10:32 to 10:47). Anthony is available until 7:45 PM, so that's okay. Then after that, the user can go to other places.\n\n4. **Sandra** is at Pacific Heights from 2:45 PM to 9:45 PM, needs 45 minutes. So possible to meet her in the afternoon or evening.\n\n5. **Stephanie** is at Russian Hill from 8 PM to 8:45 PM, needs 15 minutes. So meet her between 8 and 8:45 PM for at least 15 minutes.\n\n6. **Kevin** is at Fisherman's Wharf from 7:15 PM to 9:45 PM, needs 75 minutes. So needs to meet him for 1h15m. That's a longer meeting. So Kevin's meeting needs to be scheduled in the evening.\n\nSo let's try to structure the day.\n\nStart with Steven at Golden Gate Park from 9:07 AM to 10:22 AM (75 minutes). Then meet Anthony at Alamo Square from 10:32 to 10:47 (15 minutes). Then perhaps move to other locations.\n\nBut after Anthony, where next? Let's see the remaining friends: Sandra, Stephanie, Kevin. Robert is not possible. So after Anthony, the user has time from 10:47 AM onwards. Let's see Sandra is available from 2:45 PM. So maybe after Anthony, there's a gap until 2:45 PM. But maybe we can fit another meeting in between. Wait, but the only other possible meeting is Sandra, Stephanie, and Kevin. Let's see:\n\nFrom 10:47 AM to 2:45 PM, that's about 4 hours. But Sandra isn't available until 2:45 PM. So perhaps that time is free. Wait, but maybe there's another friend? No. The other friends are Robert (can't meet), Steven (already met), Anthony (met), Stephanie (evening), Kevin (evening), and Sandra (afternoon).\n\nSo between 10:47 AM and 2:45 PM, there's a gap. But maybe the user can use that time to travel to Sandra's location (Pacific Heights) in advance? But Sandra isn't available until 2:45 PM. So maybe the user can spend the time elsewhere, but perhaps it's better to schedule the next meeting as Sandra at 2:45 PM.\n\nBut first, after Anthony at Alamo Square (10:47 AM), the next possible meeting is Sandra at Pacific Heights starting at 2:45 PM. But that leaves a 3h58m gap. That's a lot. Maybe there's a way to fit in another meeting? But according to the constraints, the only friends are the ones listed. So no other meetings. So the user has free time until Sandra's availability.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can adjust the order to fit in more meetings. Let's think again. Maybe after meeting Steven, instead of meeting Anthony, go to Sandra earlier. Wait, Sandra is only available from 2:45 PM. So even if the user goes to Pacific Heights earlier, she's not there. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Anthony first. Let's reevaluate:\n\nStarting at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. If the user first meets Anthony, which is 5 minutes away (Alamo Square). So leave at 9 AM, arrive at 9:05 AM. Meet from 9:05 to 9:20 AM (15 minutes). Then travel to Golden Gate Park (from Alamo Square to Golden Gate Park is 9 minutes? Let me check. Alamo Square to Golden Gate Park: travel time is 9 minutes. So leave Alamo Square at 9:20, arrive at 9:29. Then meet Steven from 9:29 to 10:44 (75 minutes). Then after that, maybe that frees up the rest of the day. But then, after Steven, the user is at Golden Gate Park. Let's see:\n\nFrom 10:44 AM, the user could go to other locations. Sandra is available from 2:45 PM. So the user has from 10:44 AM to 2:45 PM. That's about 4 hours. Maybe the user can travel to Pacific Heights early, but Sandra isn't available until 2:45 PM. So that's not useful. Alternatively, maybe the user can go to another location. But there's no other friends available during that time. So maybe that's still a gap. But perhaps this order allows for a better schedule later.\n\nBut let's compare the two options:\n\nOption 1: Steven first (9:07-10:22), then Anthony (10:32-10:47). Then free until 2:45 PM.\n\nOption 2: Anthony first (9:05-9:20), Steven (9:29-10:44). Then free until 2:45 PM.\n\nEither way, there's a gap. So maybe the order doesn't matter much here. Let's proceed with Option 1, as it's more straightforward.\n\nNow, after Anthony, the user has to schedule Sandra, Stephanie, and Kevin.\n\nSandra needs 45 minutes, available from 2:45 PM. Let's plan to meet her as early as possible to allow time for evening meetings.\n\nSo the user is at Alamo Square after meeting Anthony until 10:47 AM. Then, perhaps go to Pacific Heights (Sandra's location) later. But let's plan the next step after 10:47 AM.\n\nWait, from Alamo Square, the user can go anywhere. Let's think about the travel times. Let's see:\n\nFrom Alamo Square to Pacific Heights: travel time is 10 minutes. So if the user leaves Alamo Square at 10:47 AM, arrives at Pacific Heights at 10:57 AM. But Sandra isn't available until 2:45 PM. So that's too early. So the user can't meet Sandra until 2:45 PM. So the user has to wait until then. Alternatively, the user can go to another location, but there's no other friends available. So perhaps the user can spend time elsewhere, but that's not necessary for scheduling.\n\nSo, the next meeting is Sandra at Pacific Heights. The earliest start time is 2:45 PM. Let's plan to arrive at 2:45 PM. So the user needs to leave their current location (wherever they are) to reach Pacific Heights by 2:45 PM.\n\nAssuming the user is at Alamo Square after meeting Anthony at 10:47 AM. They can stay there or go somewhere else. But since there's no other meetings, perhaps they stay until it's time to go to Pacific Heights. The travel time from Alamo Square to Pacific Heights is 10 minutes. So leaving at 2:35 PM to arrive at 2:45 PM. Then meet Sandra from 2:45 PM to 3:30 PM (45 minutes).\n\nAfter Sandra, the next meetings are Stephanie and Kevin. Let's see:\n\nStephanie is at Russian Hill from 8 PM to 8:45 PM. Needs at least 15 minutes. Kevin is at Fisherman's Wharf from 7:15 PM to 9:45 PM, needs 75 minutes. So Kevin's meeting is longer and needs to be scheduled first.\n\nLet's see the travel times from Pacific Heights (after meeting Sandra) to Fisherman's Wharf. The travel time from Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf is 13 minutes. So if the user leaves Sandra at 3:30 PM, arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 3:43 PM. But Kevin is available from 7:15 PM. So that's way too early. So that's not possible. Therefore, the user can't meet Kevin directly after Sandra. They need to schedule Kevin's meeting in the evening.\n\nSo the user has from 3:30 PM (after Sandra) until 7:15 PM (when Kevin becomes available) to do other things. But there's no other friends available during that time except Anthony, who is available until 7:45 PM. But they already met Anthony. So the user has free time until 7:15 PM.\n\nNow, Kevin's meeting is 75 minutes. Let's plan to meet him starting as early as possible at 7:15 PM. So arrive at 7:15 PM, meet until 8:30 PM (75 minutes). Then, after that, the user needs to go to Stephanie at Russian Hill. The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. So leaving Fisherman's Wharf at 8:30 PM, arrives at Russian Hill at 8:37 PM. Stephanie is available until 8:45 PM. So meeting from 8:37 PM to 8:45 PM (8 minutes). That's not enough for the required 15 minutes. Oh, problem here. So that's not sufficient.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe meet Stephanie first, then Kevin. But Stephanie's availability is 8 PM to 8:45 PM. Let's see: If the user meets Stephanie first, then Kevin. But Kevin needs 75 minutes. Let's see:\n\nMeet Stephanie at Russian Hill from 8:00 PM to 8:15 PM (15 minutes). Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf (7 minutes). Arrive at 8:22 PM. Then meet Kevin from 8:22 PM to 9:37 PM (75 minutes). But Kevin is available until 9:45 PM, so that's okay. But wait, does the user have enough time? Let's check:\n\nStephanie's meeting: 8:00-8:15 PM (15 minutes). Then 7-minute travel to Fisherman's Wharf: arrives 8:22. Then meet Kevin from 8:22 to 9:37 PM. That's 75 minutes. Kevin's available until 9:45, so that works. Then the user is done by 9:37 PM.\n\nBut the problem is that the user needs to meet Kevin for 75 minutes. So this works. But let's check if there's a conflict with Stephanie's availability. Stephanie is available until 8:45 PM. Meeting her from 8:00 to 8:15 is okay. Then Kevin's meeting is from 8:22 to 9:37. That's feasible. But what about the travel time from Russian Hill to Fisherman's Wharf? Yes, it's 7 minutes, so leaving Russian Hill at 8:15 PM, arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 8:22 PM. Then start meeting Kevin at 8:22 PM.\n\nBut wait, the user needs to meet Kevin for 75 minutes, which would end at 9:37 PM. That's within Kevin's availability (until 9:45 PM). So this works.\n\nBut what about Sandra's meeting? Let's check the timeline again:\n\nAfter meeting Sandra at Pacific Heights until 3:30 PM, the user has time until 7:15 PM (Kevin's start time). So from 3:30 PM to 7:15 PM, that's about 3 hours 45 minutes. The user can use that time to maybe meet Anthony again (if needed), but Anthony's already met. So perhaps the user can travel to Fisherman's Wharf in advance. But Fisherman's Wharf is where Kevin is, but he's not available until 7:15 PM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can go somewhere else. But there's no other friends available. So perhaps the user stays at Pacific Heights until it's time to go to Fisherman's Wharf. Wait, after meeting Sandra at Pacific Heights until 3:30 PM, the user can go anywhere. But to minimize travel time, perhaps they can stay there or go to a location closer to Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nBut let's proceed. So after Sandra at 3:30 PM, the user has until 7:15 PM to get to Fisherman's Wharf. Travel time from Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf is 13 minutes. So the user can leave at 7:02 PM to arrive by 7:15 PM. So they can spend the time elsewhere.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to plan the schedule as:\n\n- Meet Sandra from 2:45 PM to 3:30 PM.\n\n- Then have free time until 7:15 PM.\n\n- Meet Kevin from 7:15 PM to 8:30 PM (75 minutes).\n\n- Then travel to Stephanie at Russian Hill: 7-minute travel, arriving at 8:37 PM. Meet from 8:37 PM to 8:52 PM. But Stephanie is only available until 8:45 PM. So that's a problem. The meeting would have to end by 8:45 PM, giving only 8 minutes (8:37 to 8:45). Not enough. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if the user meets Kevin from 7:15 PM to 8:30 PM, then travels to Russian Hill (7 minutes) arriving at 8:37 PM. Stephanie is available until 8:45 PM. So the meeting can be from 8:37 to 8:45 (8 minutes), which is less than the required 15. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the alternative is to meet Stephanie first, then Kevin. Let's see:\n\nStephanie's meeting: 8:00 PM to 8:15 PM. Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf (7 minutes), arrive at 8:22 PM. Meet Kevin from 8:22 PM to 9:37 PM (75 minutes). That works. So this way, both meetings are accommodated.\n\nBut how to fit this into the schedule after Sandra.\n\nSo the timeline would be:\n\n- 2:45 PM - 3:30 PM: Meet Sandra at Pacific Heights.\n\n- Then free time until 8:00 PM to meet Stephanie. But that leaves a large gap from 3:30 PM to 8:00 PM. However, during this time, the user can go to Stephanie's location (Russian Hill) early, but Stephanie isn't available until 8 PM. Alternatively, the user can use that time to travel to Russian Hill and wait. But that's not optimal. Alternatively, perhaps the user can meet Anthony again (since Anthony is available until 7:45 PM). But they already met Anthony in the morning. The problem says \"meet as many friends as possible\", but Anthony is already scheduled once, so no need to meet him again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can meet Anthony again, but the minimum time is 15 minutes, which they already met. So Anthony is already checked off.\n\nSo the user has to have a gap from 3:30 PM to 8:00 PM. Then meet Stephanie at 8:00 PM, then Kevin until 9:37 PM. That works.\n\nBut let's check the travel times between Pacific Heights and Russian Hill. From Pacific Heights to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. So if the user leaves Pacific Heights at 3:30 PM, they can go to Russian Hill (7 minutes) arriving at 3:37 PM. But Stephanie isn't there until 8 PM. So that's not useful. So the user has to wait somewhere else.\n\nBut perhaps the user can stay in Pacific Heights until it's time to go to Stephanie. Or go to another location. But this is a problem of the schedule having a long gap, but that's unavoidable given the constraints.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Steven at Golden Gate Park from 9:07 AM to 10:22 AM (75 minutes).\n\n2. Travel to Alamo Square (10 minutes), arrive at 10:32 AM. Meet Anthony from 10:32 AM to 10:47 AM (15 minutes).\n\n3. Travel to Pacific Heights (from Alamo Square to Pacific Heights is 10 minutes). Leave at 10:47 AM, arrive at 10:57 AM. But Sandra isn't available until 2:45 PM. So the user has to wait until 2:45 PM. So perhaps they can arrive at Pacific Heights at 2:35 PM (leaving from wherever they are). Let's re-examine the travel.\n\nWait, after meeting Anthony at Alamo Square until 10:47 AM, the user is free until 2:45 PM. They can go anywhere. To minimize travel time for Sandra's meeting, perhaps they can stay in Alamo Square until it's time to go to Pacific Heights. The travel time from Alamo Square to Pacific Heights is 10 minutes. So leave at 2:35 PM, arrive at 2:45 PM. Meet Sandra from 2:45 PM to 3:30 PM.\n\nThen, after Sandra, the user has to wait until 8:00 PM to meet Stephanie. So from 3:30 PM to 8:00 PM. But during this time, they can go to Fisherman's Wharf for Kevin's meeting, but Kevin isn't available until 7:15 PM. Alternatively, the user can go to Fisherman's Wharf early and wait. Let's see:\n\nIf the user leaves Pacific Heights at 3:30 PM, travels to Fisherman's Wharf (13 minutes), arrives at 3:43 PM. But Kevin isn't available until 7:15 PM. So that's a long wait. Alternatively, the user can go somewhere else, but there's no other friends available. So perhaps the user can stay in Pacific Heights until it's time to go to Kevin.\n\nBut let's proceed with the schedule:\n\n4. Meet Sandra at Pacific Heights from 2:45 PM to 3:30 PM.\n\nThen, the user needs to get to Stephanie's location (Russian Hill) by 8:00 PM. But they also need to meet Kevin. Wait, no\u2014earlier plan was to meet Stephanie first, then Kevin. So let's adjust:\n\nAfter Sandra, the user has from 3:30 PM to 7:15 PM (when Kevin becomes available). So they can go to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Kevin from 7:15 PM to 8:30 PM. Then travel to Russian Hill (7 minutes) to meet Stephanie from 8:37 PM to 8:45 PM. But Stephanie's meeting requires 15 minutes. That's only 8 minutes. Not enough.\n\nAlternative approach: Meet Kevin first, then Stephanie. But Kevin's meeting ends at 9:37 PM, and Stephanie's availability ends at 8:45 PM. So that doesn't work. So the only way to meet both is to meet Stephanie first, then Kevin.\n\nSo the schedule would be:\n\n4. Meet Sandra from 2:45 PM to 3:30 PM.\n\n5. Then, free until 8:00 PM. Travel to Russian Hill (from Pacific Heights to Russian Hill is 7 minutes). Leave at 7:53 PM, arrive at 8:00 PM. Meet Stephanie from 8:00 PM to 8:15 PM.\n\n6. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (7 minutes), arrive at 8:22 PM. Meet Kevin from 8:22 PM to 9:37 PM (75 minutes).\n\nThis works. Let's check:\n\n- Stephanie's meeting: 8:00-8:15 PM (15 minutes). Within her availability (8-8:45 PM).\n\n- Kevin's meeting: 8:22-9:37 PM (75 minutes), within his availability (7:15 PM-9:45 PM).\n\nSo this works. Now, the travel from Pacific Heights to Russian Hill: Pacific Heights to Russian Hill is 7 minutes. So leaving Pacific Heights at 7:53 PM, arrive at Russian Hill at 8:00 PM.\n\nThen after meeting Stephanie, leave at 8:15 PM, travel to Fisherman's Wharf (7 minutes), arrive at 8:22 PM.\n\nThis way, all meetings are accommodated.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n1. Meet Steven at Golden Gate Park: 9:07 AM to 10:22 AM.\n\n2. Meet Anthony at Alamo Square: 10:32 AM to 10:47 AM.\n\n3. Meet Sandra at Pacific Heights: 2:45 PM to 3:30 PM.\n\n4. Meet Stephanie at Russian Hill: 8:00 PM to 8:15 PM.\n\n5. Meet Kevin at Fisherman's Wharf: 8:22 PM to 9:37 PM.\n\nNow, check travel times between each meeting:\n\n- After meeting Steven at Golden Gate Park (10:22 AM), travel to Alamo Square takes 10 minutes. So leaving at 10:22, arrive at 10:32 AM. Correct.\n\n- After Anthony (10:47 AM), need to travel to Pacific Heights by 2:45 PM. The user has to leave Alamo Square at 2:35 PM (10 minutes travel) to arrive at 2:45 PM. So between 10:47 AM and 2:35 PM, there's a gap. But that's acceptable.\n\n- After Sandra (3:30 PM), the user stays in Pacific Heights until 7:53 PM to leave for Russian Hill. That's a long gap, but there's no other meetings possible.\n\n- Then to Stephanie, then to Kevin.\n\nThis schedule meets all required minimum times and fits within availability.\n\nBut wait, let's check if the user can meet Robert. Earlier analysis said no, but let's double-check. Robert's available until 10:30 AM, needs 90 minutes. The user arrives at Haight-Ashbury at 9 AM. Travel to Nob Hill takes 15 minutes. So arrival at 9:15 AM. Meeting from 9:15 to 10:45 AM (90 minutes), but Robert is only available until 10:30 AM. So that's 75 minutes. Not enough. So Robert can't be met. So the itinerary is correct without Robert.\n\nThus, the final schedule includes Steven, Anthony, Sandra, Stephanie, and Kevin. Five meetings. That's the maximum possible given the constraints.",
