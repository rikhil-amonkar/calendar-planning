            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to schedule all these meetings. The user arrives at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, considering the constraints and travel times. Let's look at each person's availability and required meeting duration.\n\nFirst, Jeffrey is at Presidio from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM. The user wants to meet him for at least 105 minutes (1 hour 45 minutes). But the user arrives at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. The travel time from Nob Hill to Presidio is 17 minutes. So leaving at 9:00, arrival at Presidio would be 9:17 AM. Jeffrey is available until 10:00 AM. So from 9:17 to 10:00 is 43 minutes. That's not enough for 105 minutes. Wait, that's a problem. How can we meet Jeffrey? Maybe I miscalculated. Wait, the user arrives at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. Jeffrey's time is until 10 AM. So the latest possible start time with Jeffrey would need to be 10:00 AM minus 105 minutes, which is 8:15 AM. But the user isn't there yet. So maybe Jeffrey isn't possible? That's conflicting. Wait, maybe the user can leave immediately to Presidio. Let's see: arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00, leave immediately. Travel time 17 minutes. So arrive at Presidio at 9:17. Jeffrey is there until 10:00 AM. So the meeting would have to end at 10:00 AM. So the meeting time is from 9:17 to 10:00, which is 43 minutes. But the required duration is 105 minutes. So that's not possible. Therefore, maybe Jeffrey can't be met. But the user wants to meet as many friends as possible. Hmm, maybe this is a mistake. Let's check the constraints again. Oh, the user would like to meet Jeffrey for 105 minutes, but given the time constraints, it's impossible. So maybe Jeffrey is excluded?\n\nWait, but maybe the user can adjust. Let me double-check. Jeffrey's available from 8 AM to 10 AM. User starts at 9 AM at Nob Hill. Travel time 17 minutes. So arrival at Presidio at 9:17. Available until 10 AM. So the meeting can only be 43 minutes. Which is less than the required 105. So Jeffrey can't be met. So maybe skip Jeffrey.\n\nNext, John is at Pacific Heights from 9 AM to 1:30 PM. Need to meet him for at least 15 minutes. The user starts at Nob Hill. Travel time to Pacific Heights is 8 minutes. So leave at 9:00, arrive at 9:08. Then meet John from 9:08 to, say, 9:23 (15 minutes). Then next, where to go. But let's see other options.\n\nSteven is available from 1:30 PM to 10 PM at North Beach. Need 45 minutes. Barbara is available from 6 PM to 9:30 PM at Fisherman's Wharf, needs 30 minutes.\n\nSo possible itinerary: Start with John in Pacific Heights. Then go to Steven in North Beach, but need to check the time between. Then Barbara in the evening.\n\nWait, let's outline possible steps.\n\nOption 1: Meet John first. Then meet Steven, then Barbara.\n\nBut let's think about the timing.\n\nStarting at Nob Hill 9:00 AM. Go to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes. Arrive 9:08. Meet John from 9:08 to 9:23 (15 mins). Then, next, where? Maybe go to North Beach to meet Steven later, but Steven's available from 1:30 PM. So there's time between 9:23 AM and 1:30 PM. Maybe meet others, but there's only Jeffrey (who can't be met), Barbara (available in the evening), and Steven (available after 1:30 PM). So after meeting John, there's a gap. Maybe we can go to another location, but no other friends are available during that time. So maybe the user can do other things, but the goal is to meet friends. So perhaps after John, next is Steven at 1:30 PM.\n\nWait, but Steven is in North Beach. From Pacific Heights to North Beach is 9 minutes (checking travel times: Pacific Heights to North Beach is 9 minutes). So leave Pacific Heights at 9:23, travel time 9 minutes. Arrive at North Beach at 9:32. But Steven is not available until 1:30 PM. So that's too early. So the user can't meet Steven then. So maybe after meeting John, the user has free time until Steven's availability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after John, can the user go to meet Barbara in the evening? But Barbara is available from 6 PM. That's a long gap. But perhaps there's another friend. Wait, no others except Jeffrey (who can't be met). So maybe the optimal schedule is John, Steven, Barbara.\n\nBut let's check the timings.\n\nJohn: 9:08-9:23 (15 mins). Then next, travel from Pacific Heights to North Beach when Steven is available. Let's see. Steven is available from 1:30 PM. So the user could plan to arrive at North Beach by 1:30 PM. The travel time from Pacific Heights to North Beach is 9 minutes. So if the user leaves Pacific Heights at, say, 1:21 PM, arrives at 1:30 PM. Then meet Steven from 1:30 to 2:15 PM (45 mins). Then next, Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf. Travel time from North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf is 5 minutes. So leave North Beach at 2:15 PM, arrive at 2:20 PM. But Barbara is available from 6 PM. So that's a problem. The user can't meet Barbara until 6 PM. So between 2:15 PM and 6 PM, there's a gap. So the user can't meet Barbara until 6 PM. So after meeting Steven at 2:15 PM, the user has to wait until 6 PM. Then go to Fisherman's Wharf. Let's see: North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf is 5 minutes. So leave North Beach at 5:55 PM, arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 6:00 PM. Meet Barbara from 6:00 to 6:30 PM (30 mins). That works.\n\nBut the user can also consider meeting Barbara after 6 PM. So the itinerary would be:\n\nJohn: 9:08-9:23\n\nSteven: 1:30-2:15\n\nBarbara: 6:00-6:30\n\nBut is there any other way to fit in more people? Jeffrey is impossible. So that's three meetings. But wait, maybe there's a way to meet Steven and Barbara more efficiently.\n\nWait, Steven is available until 10 PM. So after meeting Barbara at 6:00-6:30, the user could go back to Steven? But why? Because the user has already met Steven once. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible, not to meet them multiple times. So John, Steven, Barbara: three meetings. That's the maximum possible, given that Jeffrey can't be met.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check. Jeffrey's availability is 8 AM to 10 AM. User arrives at Nob Hill at 9 AM. To meet Jeffrey, they have to leave immediately. Arrive at Presidio at 9:17 AM. Then the latest they can stay is 10 AM. So 43 minutes. But the required duration is 105 minutes. So that's impossible. So Jeffrey is out.\n\nSo the possible friends to meet are John, Steven, Barbara. John's slot is 9 AM to 1:30 PM. Need 15 minutes. Steven from 1:30 PM onwards. Barbara from 6 PM.\n\nSo the optimal schedule would be:\n\n1. Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. Travel to Pacific Heights (8 mins). Arrive 9:08. Meet John until 9:23.\n\n2. Then, from Pacific Heights, travel to North Beach. But Steven is available only from 1:30 PM. So what to do between 9:23 AM and 1:30 PM? The user can't meet anyone else. So maybe there's a way to rearrange.\n\nWait, maybe meet John later? For example, the user could go to John after trying to meet someone else. But John is available until 1:30 PM. So perhaps meet Steven first? But Steven is available only from 1:30 PM. Hmm. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: After meeting John in the morning, the user can go to another location, but no friends are available until Steven at 1:30 PM. So perhaps the user can use the time to travel to North Beach early and wait until 1:30 PM. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe meet John later in the day, closer to Steven's time.\n\nWait, John's available until 1:30 PM. So the latest the user can meet John is starting at 1:15 PM (15 minutes meeting). Let's see. If the user starts at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM. Maybe they can go to Presidio first (even though Jeffrey can't be met), but that's not useful. Alternatively, maybe meet John in the late morning.\n\nWait, maybe the user can do John in the morning, then have time to go somewhere else, but since there's no other friends available until Steven, perhaps it's best to meet John early.\n\nSo itinerary:\n\n9:00 AM - Depart Nob Hill.\n\n9:08 AM - Arrive Pacific Heights, meet John until 9:23 AM.\n\nThen, from 9:23 AM to 1:30 PM: free time. Then travel to North Beach (from Pacific Heights to North Beach is 9 minutes). Leave at 1:21 PM, arrive at 1:30 PM. Meet Steven until 2:15 PM.\n\nThen, from 2:15 PM to 6:00 PM: free time. Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf (from North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf is 5 minutes). Leave at 5:55 PM, arrive 6:00 PM. Meet Barbara until 6:30 PM.\n\nThat works. So three meetings. But maybe there's a way to fit in another meeting. But Jeffrey's impossible. So that's the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, could the user meet John, then go to another location to meet someone else, but there's no one else available until 1:30 PM. So no. So the maximum is three meetings: John, Steven, Barbara.\n\nWait, but the user could also check if there's a way to meet John and Jeffrey. But as previously determined, Jeffrey can't be met. So no.\n\nAnother thought: Could the user meet John for 15 minutes, then immediately go to another location? For example, after meeting John at Pacific Heights (9:08-9:23), then go to Presidio to meet Jeffrey. But Jeffrey is only available until 10 AM. Travel time from Pacific Heights to Presidio is 11 minutes. So leave at 9:23, arrive at 9:34. Then meet Jeffrey from 9:34 to 10:00. That's 26 minutes. But the required duration is 105 minutes. So that's not possible. So no.\n\nSo the conclusion is that only three meetings are possible: John, Steven, Barbara.\n\nNow, let's check the timings again for accuracy.\n\nJohn's meeting:\n\nStart at 9:08 AM, end at 9:23 AM (15 minutes).\n\nThen, after that, the user has free time until 1:21 PM, when they leave Pacific Heights to go to North Beach. Wait, no. Wait, after meeting John, the user is at Pacific Heights. So they need to travel from Pacific Heights to North Beach. The travel time is 9 minutes. To arrive at North Beach by 1:30 PM, they need to leave Pacific Heights at 1:21 PM. So between 9:23 AM and 1:21 PM, that's about 3 hours and 58 minutes of free time. But that's okay.\n\nThen meet Steven from 1:30 PM to 2:15 PM (45 minutes).\n\nThen, after that, they need to go to Fisherman's Wharf for Barbara. Travel time from North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf is 5 minutes. Barbara is available from 6 PM. So to arrive at 6 PM, leave North Beach at 5:55 PM. So between 2:15 PM and 5:55 PM, that's another 3 hours and 40 minutes of free time. Then meet Barbara from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM.\n\nSo all three meetings fit. All durations meet the minimum required.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Pacific Heights\", \"person\": \"John\", \"start_time\": \"9:08\", \"end_time\": \"9:23\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Steven\", \"start_time\": \"13:30\", \"end_time\": \"14:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"18:00\", \"end_time\": \"18:30\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the JSON format requires the itinerary array. So three entries. Let me check the times again.\n\nJohn's start time: 9:08 AM (9:08), end at 9:23.\n\nSteven: 1:30 PM (13:30) to 2:15 PM (14:15).\n\nBarbara: 6:00 PM (18:00) to 6:30 PM (18:30).\n\nYes. So this should be the correct schedule.",
