            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. I need to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco considering the travel times and constraints. Let's start by listing all the people and their availability along with the required meeting durations.\n\nFirst, the user starts at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM. Let's look at the earliest available meetings. Kimberly is at Alamo Square from 9:00 AM to 2:30 PM and needs 105 minutes (1 hour 45 minutes). The travel time from Russian Hill to Alamo Square is 15 minutes. So leaving at 9:00 AM, arriving at 9:15 AM. Then meeting from 9:15 AM to 11:00 AM (105 minutes). That uses up Kimberly's time, which is good because she has to be done by 2:30 PM, but starting early allows for more flexibility later.\n\nNext, William is at Presidio until 12:45 PM, needing 60 minutes. The travel time from Alamo Square to Presidio is 17 minutes. If we leave Alamo Square at 11:00 AM, arrive at Presidio by 11:17 AM. Then meet William from 11:17 AM to 12:17 PM. But wait, William is available until 12:45 PM, so this works. However, maybe there's a better way? Let me check other options. Alternatively, maybe after Kimberly, go to William first. Let's see: Russian Hill to Presidio is 14 minutes. If the user starts at 9:00 AM, they can go directly to Presidio by 9:14 AM, meet William from 9:14 AM to 10:14 AM (60 minutes). Then travel to Alamo Square from Presidio. Travel time Presidio to Alamo Square is 19 minutes. Arrive at 10:33 AM. Then meet Kimberly from 10:33 AM to 12:18 PM (105 minutes). That way, Kimberly is done by 12:18 PM, well within her 2:30 PM end time. But does that allow for other meetings? Let's see.\n\nBut wait, David is at Sunset District from 9:15 AM to 10:00 PM, but needs only 15 minutes. Maybe we can fit him in early. But starting at Russian Hill, if the user goes to David first, the travel time is 23 minutes. Arrive at 9:23 AM. But David is available starting 9:15 AM, so a meeting from 9:23 AM to 9:38 AM. But then after that, going to Presidio would take 16 minutes (Sunset to Presidio is 16), arriving at 9:54 AM. Then meet William from 9:54 AM to 10:54 AM. But William is available until 12:45 PM, so that works. Then from Presidio to Alamo Square is 19 minutes, arriving at 11:13 AM. Then meet Kimberly from 11:13 AM to 1:58 PM. But Kimberly's end time is 2:30 PM, so that's okay. But this schedule includes David, William, Kimberly. But Kimberly's meeting would end at 1:58 PM, which leaves some time before other afternoon meetings. However, the required duration for Kimberly is 105 minutes. Let's check:\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with William first. Let's see: From Russian Hill to Presidio is 14 minutes. Arrive at 9:14 AM. Meet William 9:14 AM to 10:14 AM. Then go to Alamo Square, which is 19 minutes (Presidio to Alamo Square), arriving at 10:33 AM. Meet Kimberly 10:33 AM to 12:18 PM. Then, after Kimberly, maybe meet David in Sunset District. From Alamo Square to Sunset District is 16 minutes, arriving at 12:34 PM. Meet David 12:34 PM to 12:49 PM. That's 15 minutes, meeting his requirement. Then, what's next?\n\nAfter that, the afternoon meetings start. Let's look at the afternoon constraints:\n\nMary is at Marina District from 2:45 PM to 4:45 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n\nJoshua is at Financial District from 2:30 PM to 5:15 PM, needs 90 minutes.\n\nGeorge is at The Castro from 2:15 PM to 7:00 PM, needs 105 minutes.\n\nPatricia is at Nob Hill from 3:00 PM to 7:15 PM, needs 120 minutes.\n\nCharles is at Richmond District from 5:15 PM to 9:00 PM, 15 minutes.\n\nRonald is at Embarcadero from 6:15 PM to 8:45 PM, 30 minutes.\n\nKenneth is at Union Square from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM, 15 minutes.\n\nSo after the morning meetings (William, Kimberly, David), the next is to schedule the afternoon ones. Let's see the order.\n\nBut wait, after meeting David at Sunset District, the next possible is George at The Castro. From Sunset District to The Castro is 17 minutes. But if we met David at 12:34 PM to 12:49 PM, then leave at 12:49 PM, arrive at The Castro by 1:06 PM. But George is available from 2:15 PM. So that's too early. So perhaps George can't be met until after 2:15 PM. So maybe after Kimberly and William, perhaps schedule other meetings.\n\nWait, after meeting Kimberly at Alamo Square until 12:18 PM, then perhaps go to Union Square to meet Kenneth? But Kenneth is only available from 9:15 PM. So no. Alternatively, go to meet Joshua at Financial District. But Joshua is available from 2:30 PM. So after Kimberly, maybe go to meet Mary at Marina District starting at 2:45 PM. Let's see.\n\nBut let's plan step by step.\n\nMorning:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Start at Russian Hill 9:00 AM.\n\n- Go to Presidio (14 min), arrive 9:14 AM. Meet William 9:14-10:14 AM.\n\n- Travel to Alamo Square (19 min), arrive 10:33 AM. Meet Kimberly 10:33-12:18 PM.\n\n- Then, after Kimberly, maybe meet David. From Alamo Square to Sunset District is 16 min. Arrive 12:34 PM. Meet David 12:34-12:49 PM.\n\nThen, the afternoon.\n\nAfter 12:49 PM, next is George (The Castro) available from 2:15 PM. Let's see if there's time to do something else between 12:49 PM and 2:15 PM. Perhaps travel to The Castro early? But George isn't available until 2:15 PM. Alternatively, maybe visit another person. Let's see.\n\nMary is at Marina District from 2:45 PM. Joshua at Financial District from 2:30 PM. So between 12:49 PM and 2:30 PM, there's about 1 hour 41 minutes. Could we fit in someone else? Let's check other friends. David is already met. Others like Charles are later. Patricia is from 3 PM. So maybe not. So perhaps travel from Sunset District (after meeting David) to Marina District for Mary. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting David at Sunset District until 12:49 PM, then travel to Marina District. Travel time Sunset to Marina is 21 minutes. Arrive 1:10 PM. But Mary is available from 2:45 PM. So that's a long wait. Not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting David, go to The Castro to meet George, but George isn't available until 2:15 PM. So maybe have a gap. Wait at The Castro until 2:15 PM. But that's 1 hour 26 minutes (from 12:49 PM arrival to 2:15 PM). Not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after meeting David, go to another location. But perhaps it's better to plan to meet Joshua at Financial District starting at 2:30 PM. Let's see:\n\nFrom Sunset District to Financial District is 30 minutes. If we leave at 12:49 PM, arrive at 1:19 PM. But Joshua is available from 2:30 PM. So that's a wait of 1 hour 11 minutes. Not great. Alternatively, maybe after Kimberly, instead of meeting David, go directly to Marina District for Mary. Let's see:\n\nAfter Kimberly ends at 12:18 PM, travel from Alamo Square to Marina District: 15 minutes. Arrive 12:33 PM. But Mary is available from 2:45 PM. So again, a long wait. Not good.\n\nHmm. Maybe the initial plan of meeting William, Kimberly, and David in the morning is possible, but leaves gaps in the afternoon. Alternatively, perhaps adjust the morning meetings to allow for better afternoon scheduling.\n\nAlternative morning plan:\n\nStart at Russian Hill 9:00 AM.\n\nGo to Alamo Square (15 min), arrive 9:15 AM. Meet Kimberly 9:15-11:00 AM.\n\nThen go to Presidio (travel time Alamo to Presidio is 17 min). Arrive 11:17 AM. Meet William 11:17 AM-12:17 PM.\n\nThen, after William, go to Sunset District to meet David. Presidio to Sunset is 15 minutes (from Presidio to Sunset District is 15? Wait, looking back at the travel times. The table shows Presidio to Sunset District is 15 minutes. So from Presidio to Sunset District: 15 min. Leave Presidio at 12:17 PM, arrive at 12:32 PM. Meet David 12:32-12:47 PM (15 min). That works.\n\nThen, after David, the next step is to plan the afternoon.\n\nFrom Sunset District, where to next? Let's see:\n\nAfter 12:47 PM, next meetings are:\n\nJoshua at Financial District from 2:30 PM (needs 90 min).\n\nMary at Marina District from 2:45 PM (45 min).\n\nGeorge at The Castro from 2:15 PM (105 min).\n\nPatricia at Nob Hill from 3 PM (120 min).\n\nSo the user needs to schedule Joshua, Mary, George, Patricia, Charles, Ronald, and Kenneth.\n\nBut we need to see which can fit.\n\nLet's consider George first. He needs 105 minutes (1h45m) from 2:15 PM to 7 PM. So meeting him from, say, 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. Then, after that, maybe Mary from 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM (45 min). But Mary is at Marina District until 4:45 PM. Alternatively, perhaps meet Mary first. Let's see:\n\nFrom Sunset District to Marina District is 21 minutes. Leaving at 12:47 PM, arrive at 1:08 PM. But Mary is available at 2:45 PM. So that's too early. Alternatively, from Sunset District to The Castro. Travel time is 17 minutes. Arrive at 1:04 PM. Wait until 2:15 PM to meet George. That's 1h11m of waiting. Not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps go to Financial District to meet Joshua. From Sunset District to Financial District is 30 minutes. Arrive at 1:17 PM. Joshua is available from 2:30 PM. So wait until 2:30 PM, then meet for 90 minutes until 4:00 PM. Then, after that, go to Marina District (15 min from Financial to Marina? Wait, looking at the travel times: Financial District to Marina District is 15 minutes. So leave Financial at 4:00 PM, arrive Marina at 4:15 PM. Mary is available until 4:45 PM. So meet Mary from 4:15-4:45 PM (30 minutes), but she needs 45 minutes. Not enough. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the order. Maybe meet Mary first, then Joshua.\n\nBut Mary is available from 2:45 PM. Let's see:\n\nFrom Sunset District to Marina District is 21 minutes. Arrive at 1:08 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM, which is 1h37m. Not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting David at Sunset District (12:47 PM), go to Union Square. But Kenneth is only available at 9:15 PM. Not helpful. Or go to Nob Hill. Patricia is there from 3 PM. Let's see:\n\nFrom Sunset District to Nob Hill is 27 minutes. Arrive at 1:14 PM. But Patricia is available from 3 PM. So again, a long wait.\n\nAlternatively, go to Richmond District (Charles is there from 5:15 PM). But that's too early.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach after meeting David is to go to The Castro to meet George as early as possible. Let's see:\n\nFrom Sunset District to The Castro is 17 minutes. Arrive at 12:47 PM + 17 = 1:04 PM. But George is available from 2:15 PM. So wait until 2:15 PM. Then meet from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM (105 minutes). Then, after that, go to Marina District (The Castro to Marina District is 21 minutes). Arrive at 4:21 PM. Mary is available until 4:45 PM. So meet from 4:21 to 4:45 PM (24 minutes), which is less than the required 45. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, after George, go to Mary. If George ends at 4:00 PM, travel to Marina takes 21 minutes, arriving at 4:21 PM. Mary's end time is 4:45 PM. So 24 minutes, which isn't enough. So Mary can't be met after George.\n\nAlternative idea: Meet Mary first in the afternoon. Let's see:\n\nFrom Sunset District (after meeting David at 12:47 PM), go to Marina District (21 minutes). Arrive at 1:08 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM to meet Mary. Then meet from 2:45 PM to 3:30 PM (45 minutes). Then, after that, go to Financial District to meet Joshua. Marina to Financial is 17 minutes. Arrive at 3:47 PM. Joshua is available until 5:15 PM. So meet from 3:47 PM to 5:17 PM (but Joshua's end time is 5:15 PM). So that's 3:47 to 5:15 PM (88 minutes), which is less than the required 90. Close but not enough.\n\nAlternatively, meet Joshua first. From Sunset District to Financial District is 30 minutes. Arrive at 1:17 PM. Joshua is available from 2:30 PM. Wait until 2:30 PM. Meet from 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM (90 minutes). Then go to Marina District (15 minutes). Arrive at 4:15 PM. Meet Mary until 4:45 PM (30 minutes), but she needs 45. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Another approach: After meeting David (12:47 PM), go to The Castro early and wait for George. Let's see:\n\n12:47 PM leave Sunset, arrive The Castro 1:04 PM. Wait until 2:15 PM. Meet George 2:15-4:00 PM. Then from The Castro to Financial District is 21 minutes. Arrive 4:21 PM. Joshua is available until 5:15 PM. Meet from 4:21 to 5:15 PM (54 minutes), which is less than the required 90. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after George, go to Marina District. As before, that doesn't work for Mary.\n\nAlternatively, meet Mary first, then George.\n\nBut Mary is available from 2:45 PM. So after David, go to Marina District at 12:47 PM, arrive 1:08 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM. Meet Mary 2:45-3:30 PM. Then travel to The Castro (22 minutes from Marina), arrive 3:52 PM. Meet George from 3:52 PM to 5:37 PM (105 minutes). But George's end time is 7:00 PM, so that's okay. Then after that, go to Joshua at Financial District. The Castro to Financial is 21 minutes. Arrive 5:58 PM. But Joshua's end time is 5:15 PM. Too late. So Joshua can't be met in this scenario.\n\nSo this approach misses Joshua.\n\nJoshua needs 90 minutes between 2:30 PM and 5:15 PM. So the only way to meet him is to schedule his meeting within that window.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the key is to schedule Joshua first in the afternoon. Let's see:\n\nAfter meeting David at 12:47 PM, go to Financial District. Travel time 30 minutes, arriving 1:17 PM. Then wait until 2:30 PM. Meet Joshua from 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM. Then after Joshua, go to Marina District (15 minutes), arrive 4:15 PM. Meet Mary until 4:45 PM (30 minutes). Not enough. But maybe if we split Mary's time? No, the minimum is 45. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, meet Mary first, then Joshua. But Mary's time is 2:45 PM to 4:45 PM. Let's say meet Mary from 2:45 PM to 3:30 PM (45 minutes). Then travel to Financial District (17 minutes), arrive 3:47 PM. Meet Joshua from 3:47 PM to 5:17 PM (90 minutes). But Joshua's end time is 5:15 PM. So adjust to 3:47 PM to 5:15 PM (88 minutes). Still not enough.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the user has to choose between meeting Joshua or Mary. Let's check their constraints:\n\nJoshua requires 90 minutes, Mary requires 45. If we can't fit both, prioritize which is more important. The problem states to meet as many friends as possible. So ideally, fit both.\n\nAlternative idea: After meeting Joshua from 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM, then go to Marina District (15 minutes), arrive 4:15 PM. Mary is there until 4:45 PM. So 30 minutes. Not enough. So can't meet Mary. Alternatively, maybe meet Mary first. Let's try:\n\nFrom David at 12:47 PM, go to Marina District (21 minutes). Arrive 1:08 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM. Meet Mary 2:45 PM to 3:30 PM. Then go to Financial District (17 minutes). Arrive 3:47 PM. Meet Joshua 3:47 PM to 5:17 PM (but he ends at 5:15 PM). So 3:47 PM to 5:15 PM is 88 minutes. Still 2 minutes short. Maybe that's acceptable? But the minimum is 90. So no, can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, meet Joshua first. From David, leave at 12:47 PM, go to Financial District (30 minutes), arrive 1:17 PM. Wait until 2:30 PM. Meet Joshua 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM. Then go to Mary at Marina District (15 minutes), arrive 4:15 PM. Meet until 4:45 PM (30 minutes). Not enough. So Mary can't be met.\n\nThis suggests that meeting both Joshua and Mary might not be possible if we also meet George and Patricia.\n\nLet's see other friends. Patricia is at Nob Hill from 3 PM to 7:15 PM, needing 120 minutes. Ronald at Embarcadero from 6:15 PM. Charles at Richmond District from 5:15 PM. Kenneth at Union Square late.\n\nSo perhaps prioritize Joshua, Patricia, Ronald, Charles, George, and Kenneth. But how?\n\nAlternative schedule:\n\nMorning:\n\n- Start at Russian Hill 9:00 AM.\n\n- Meet William at Presidio 9:14-10:14 AM.\n\n- Meet Kimberly at Alamo Square 10:33 AM-12:18 PM.\n\n- Meet David at Sunset District 12:34-12:49 PM.\n\nAfternoon:\n\n- Go to Financial District (30 minutes from Sunset, arrive 1:19 PM).\n\nWait until 2:30 PM, meet Joshua 2:30-4:00 PM.\n\nThen, go to Nob Hill (Financial to Nob Hill is 8 minutes). Arrive 4:08 PM. Meet Patricia from 4:08 PM to 6:08 PM (120 minutes). But Patricia's end time is 7:15 PM, so this works.\n\nThen, after Patricia, go to Embarcadero (Nob Hill to Embarcadero is 9 minutes). Arrive 6:17 PM. Meet Ronald from 6:17 PM to 6:47 PM (30 minutes). Ronald is available until 8:45 PM.\n\nThen, go to Richmond District (Embarcadero to Richmond is 21 minutes). Arrive 7:08 PM. Meet Charles from 7:08 PM to 7:23 PM (15 minutes). Charles is available until 9 PM.\n\nFinally, go to Union Square to meet Kenneth. Richmond to Union Square is 21 minutes. Arrive 7:44 PM. Kenneth is available from 9:15 PM. So that's too early. Wait until 9:15 PM. Meet until 9:30 PM. But the user needs to be there by 9:15 PM. Travel time from Richmond to Union Square is 21 minutes. So leave Richmond at 8:54 PM to arrive at 9:15 PM. Meet Kenneth 9:15-9:30 PM. That works.\n\nBut what about George at The Castro? He needs 105 minutes. In this schedule, George isn't met. So this schedule includes William, Kimberly, David, Joshua, Patricia, Ronald, Charles, and Kenneth. That's 8 people. But George and Mary are missed.\n\nAlternatively, can we fit George in?\n\nAfter meeting Patricia at Nob Hill until 6:08 PM, instead of going to Embarcadero, maybe go to The Castro. Nob Hill to The Castro is 17 minutes. Arrive 6:25 PM. Meet George from 6:25 PM to 8:10 PM (105 minutes). But George's end time is 7:00 PM. So that's not possible. So George must be met before 7:00 PM.\n\nSo if we meet George earlier. For example, after meeting Joshua, instead of going to Patricia, go to George. Let's see:\n\nAfter Joshua ends at 4:00 PM, go to The Castro (Financial District to The Castro is 20 minutes). Arrive 4:20 PM. Meet George from 4:20 PM to 6:05 PM (105 minutes). But George's end time is 7:00 PM, so this works. Then, after George, go to Patricia. The Castro to Nob Hill is 16 minutes. Arrive 6:21 PM. Meet Patricia from 6:21 PM to 8:21 PM (120 minutes). But Patricia's end time is 7:15 PM. So only until 7:15 PM. That's 54 minutes, which is less than required 120. So no good.\n\nAlternatively, meet Patricia first. Let's see:\n\nAfter Joshua (ends at 4:00 PM), go to Nob Hill (8 minutes). Arrive 4:08 PM. Meet Patricia from 4:08 PM to 6:08 PM (120 minutes). Then go to The Castro (Nob Hill to Castro is 17 minutes). Arrive 6:25 PM. Meet George until 7:00 PM (35 minutes). But George needs 105 minutes. So not enough. \n\nThus, including George would require sacrificing either Patricia or Joshua. Since the user wants to meet as many as possible, perhaps it's better to prioritize those with tighter time windows.\n\nBut let's count how many can be met in each scenario:\n\nScenario 1: Includes William, Kimberly, David, Joshua, Patricia, Ronald, Charles, Kenneth (8 people).\n\nScenario 2: Trying to include George would require dropping someone. For example, if after meeting George, we can't meet Patricia. So maybe meet George instead of Patricia. But Patricia requires 120 minutes, so it's a big chunk. If we replace Patricia with George and Mary, but Mary's time is tight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach.\n\nAnother idea: After David in the morning, go to George at The Castro early.\n\nAfter meeting David at 12:49 PM, go to The Castro (17 minutes). Arrive 1:06 PM. Wait until 2:15 PM. Meet George from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. Then go to Financial District (21 minutes). Arrive 4:21 PM. Meet Joshua from 4:21 PM to 5:51 PM (90 minutes). But Joshua ends at 5:15 PM. So adjust to 4:21 PM to 5:15 PM (54 minutes). Not enough. So can't meet Joshua.\n\nAlternatively, after George, go to Marina District (21 minutes). Arrive 4:21 PM. Meet Mary until 4:45 PM (24 minutes). Not enough. So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm. This is quite challenging. Let's consider that maybe Mary can't be met, and focus on others.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's list all the people and their time windows, then see the possible order.\n\nPeople:\n\n1. David: Sunset, 9:15 AM-10 PM, 15 min.\n\n2. Kenneth: Union Square, 9:15 PM-9:45 PM, 15 min.\n\n3. Patricia: Nob Hill, 3 PM-7:15 PM, 120 min.\n\n4. Mary: Marina, 2:45 PM-4:45 PM, 45 min.\n\n5. Charles: Richmond, 5:15 PM-9 PM, 15 min.\n\n6. Joshua: Financial, 2:30 PM-5:15 PM, 90 min.\n\n7. Ronald: Embarcadero, 6:15 PM-8:45 PM, 30 min.\n\n8. George: The Castro, 2:15 PM-7 PM, 105 min.\n\n9. Kimberly: Alamo, 9 AM-2:30 PM, 105 min.\n\n10. William: Presidio, 7 AM-12:45 PM, 60 min.\n\nThe morning has William and Kimberly. Let's maximize those.\n\nMorning Plan:\n\nStart at Russian Hill 9:00 AM.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- William first: Russian Hill to Presidio (14 min), arrive 9:14 AM. Meet until 10:14 AM.\n\n- Then to Alamo Square (19 min), arrive 10:33 AM. Meet Kimberly until 12:18 PM.\n\n- Then to Sunset District (16 min), arrive 12:34 PM. Meet David until 12:49 PM.\n\nAfternoon Plan:\n\nFrom 12:49 PM, need to schedule George, Joshua, Mary, Patricia, Charles, Ronald, Kenneth.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAfter 12:49 PM, the next available is George from 2:15 PM.\n\nBut from 12:49 PM to 2:15 PM is 1h26m. Maybe use this time to meet someone else, but who?\n\nJoshua starts at 2:30 PM. Mary at 2:45 PM. Patricia at 3 PM.\n\nAlternatively, travel to The Castro (17 min from Sunset), arrive 1:06 PM. Wait until 2:15 PM. Meet George 2:15-4:00 PM.\n\nThen, after George, go to Financial District (21 min). Arrive 4:21 PM. Joshua is available until 5:15 PM. Meet from 4:21 to 5:15 PM (54 min). Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after George, go to Marina District (21 min). Arrive 4:21 PM. Mary until 4:45 PM (24 min). Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after George, go to Patricia at Nob Hill. The Castro to Nob Hill is 16 min. Arrive 4:16 PM. Meet Patricia until 6:16 PM (120 min). But Patricia's end time is 7:15 PM. So this works. Then after Patricia, go to Embarcadero (Nob Hill to Embarcadero is 9 min). Arrive 6:25 PM. Meet Ronald from 6:25-6:55 PM. Then go to Richmond (Embarcadero to Richmond is 21 min). Arrive 7:16 PM. Meet Charles 7:16-7:31 PM. Then go to Union Square (Richmond to Union Square is 21 min). Arrive 7:52 PM. Wait until 9:15 PM to meet Kenneth. That's a long wait, but possible.\n\nThis schedule includes William, Kimberly, David, George, Patricia, Ronald, Charles, and Kenneth. That's 8 people. But Joshua and Mary are missed.\n\nAlternatively, after George, go to Joshua's Financial District. As before, not enough time.\n\nAnother approach: After George, go to Marina District (The Castro to Marina is 21 min), arrive 4:21 PM. Mary is available until 4:45 PM. Meet until 4:45 PM (24 minutes). Not enough. So Mary is missed.\n\nSo this approach includes 8 people, missing Joshua and Mary.\n\nAlternative approach: Include Joshua instead of George.\n\nAfternoon Plan:\n\nAfter David (12:49 PM), go to Financial District (30 min), arrive 1:19 PM. Wait until 2:30 PM. Meet Joshua until 4:00 PM. Then go to Marina District (15 min), arrive 4:15 PM. Meet Mary until 4:45 PM (30 min). Not enough. Then go to Nob Hill (Marina to Nob Hill is 12 min). Arrive 4:57 PM. Meet Patricia from 4:57 PM to 6:57 PM. But Patricia's end time is 7:15 PM. So possible. Then go to Embarcadero (9 min), arrive 7:06 PM. Meet Ronald until 7:36 PM. Then to Richmond (21 min), arrive 7:57 PM. Meet Charles until 8:12 PM. Then to Union Square (21 min), arrive 8:33 PM. Wait until 9:15 PM to meet Kenneth.\n\nThis includes William, Kimberly, David, Joshua, Mary (partial), Patricia, Ronald, Charles, Kenneth. But Mary's meeting is only 30 minutes, which is less than required 45. So Mary can't be counted. So Joshua and Patricia are met, but Mary is not. Total 8 people.\n\nComparing the two options: including George or Joshua. Which gives more people met?\n\nBoth scenarios have 8 people. But perhaps George requires a longer meeting time, so including him might mean missing others. Alternatively, maybe another combination.\n\nAnother Idea: After Joshua (4:00 PM), go to Marina District (15 min), arrive 4:15 PM. Mary until 4:45 PM (30 minutes). Then go to The Castro (Marina to Castro is 22 min). Arrive 5:07 PM. Meet George until 7:00 PM (113 minutes). But George needs 105 minutes. So 5:07 PM to 7:00 PM is 113 minutes. That's more than needed. So meet from 5:07 PM to 6:52 PM (105 minutes). Then, go to Nob Hill (Castro to Nob Hill is 16 min). Arrive 7:08 PM. Meet Patricia until 7:15 PM (7 minutes). Not enough. So Patricia can't be met. Thus, this approach includes George, Joshua, Mary (30 min), but Mary doesn't count. So total 7 people (William, Kimberly, David, Joshua, George, Ronald, Charles, Kenneth). But Patricia is missed.\n\nHmm. This is quite complex. Let's try to make the best possible schedule that meets the maximum number of friends with their required durations.\n\nThe optimal schedule seems to be:\n\nMorning:\n\n- William: 9:14-10:14 AM.\n\n- Kimberly: 10:33 AM-12:18 PM.\n\n- David: 12:34-12:49 PM.\n\nAfternoon:\n\n- Joshua: 2:30-4:00 PM.\n\n- Patricia: 4:08-6:08 PM.\n\n- Ronald: 6:17-6:47 PM.\n\n- Charles: 7:08-7:23 PM.\n\n- Kenneth: 9:15-9:30 PM.\n\nTotal of 8 friends met (William, Kimberly, David, Joshua, Patricia, Ronald, Charles, Kenneth).\n\nGeorge and Mary are missed. Alternatively, if we include George instead of Joshua and Patricia, but that's fewer people.\n\nSo this seems to be the maximum possible.\n\nNow, let's verify travel times between each meeting:\n\n1. After David at Sunset District (12:49 PM), travel to Financial District takes 30 minutes. Arrive 1:19 PM. Wait until 2:30 PM. Meet Joshua until 4:00 PM.\n\n2. Financial District to Nob Hill: 8 minutes. Arrive 4:08 PM. Meet Patricia until 6:08 PM.\n\n3. Nob Hill to Embarcadero: 9 minutes. Arrive 6:17 PM. Meet Ronald until 6:47 PM.\n\n4. Embarcadero to Richmond District: 19 minutes. Arrive 7:06 PM. Wait until 7:08 PM (but Charles is available from 5:15 PM). Meet Charles from 7:08-7:23 PM.\n\nWait, no. From Embarcadero to Richmond District is 21 minutes (from travel times: Embarcadero to Richmond District is 19 minutes? Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the travel times:\n\nEmbarcadero to Richmond District: 19 minutes. Yes. So from Embarcadero, leave at 6:47 PM, arrive Richmond at 7:06 PM. Meet Charles from 7:06-7:21 PM (15 minutes). Then travel to Union Square: Richmond to Union Square is 21 minutes. Arrive 7:42 PM. Wait until 9:15 PM. Meet Kenneth from 9:15-9:30 PM.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n[\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Presidio\", \"person\": \"William\", \"start_time\": \"9:14\", \"end_time\": \"10:14\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"person\": \"Kimberly\", \"start_time\": \"10:33\", \"end_time\": \"12:18\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Sunset District\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"12:34\", \"end_time\": \"12:49\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Financial District\", \"person\": \"Joshua\", \"start_time\": \"14:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:00\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Nob Hill\", \"person\": \"Patricia\", \"start_time\": \"16:08\", \"end_time\": \"18:08\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Embarcadero\", \"person\": \"Ronald\", \"start_time\": \"18:17\", \"end_time\": \"18:47\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Richmond District\", \"person\": \"Charles\", \"start_time\": \"19:06\", \"end_time\": \"19:21\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"Union Square\", \"person\": \"Kenneth\", \"start_time\": \"21:15\", \"end_time\": \"21:30\"}\n]\n\nWait, but Joshua's name is Joshua, not Joshia. Let's correct that.\n\nAlso, need to check the travel times between each step.\n\nFrom Sunset District to Financial District: 30 minutes. So leaving at 12:49 PM, arrival at 1:19 PM. Then wait until 2:30 PM.\n\nFinancial District to Nob Hill: 8 minutes. Leave at 4:00 PM, arrive 4:08 PM.\n\nNob Hill to Embarcadero: 9 minutes. Leave at 6:08 PM, arrive 6:17 PM.\n\nEmbarcadero to Richmond District: 19 minutes. Leave at 6:47 PM, arrive 7:06 PM.\n\nRichmond District to Union Square: 21 minutes. Leave at 7:21 PM, arrive 7:42 PM. Wait until 9:15 PM.\n\nThis all checks out.\n\nGeorge and Mary are not met, but this schedule includes 8 friends. Is there a way to include George instead of Joshua and Patricia?\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nMorning: William, Kimberly, David.\n\nAfternoon: George (2:15-4:00 PM), then Mary (4:21-4:45 PM) but insufficient. Then Patricia (4:45 PM arrival, meet until 6:45 PM, but Patricia ends at 7:15 PM. So meet until 7:15 PM (90 minutes). Not enough.\n\nSo it's better to include Joshua and Patricia, meeting 8 people.",
