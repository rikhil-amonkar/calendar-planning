            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule meetings with as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and constraints. The user starts at Sunset District at 9:00 AM. The friends are in different districts with specific availability times and minimum meeting durations. Let me start by listing all the friends and their constraints.\n\nFirst, Karen is in Russian Hill from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM, but the user needs to meet her for 60 minutes. Wait, that's a problem because her availability is only 60 minutes (from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM). So the user would have to be there exactly from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM. But considering the travel time, can they make it after previous meetings?\n\nNext, Jessica is in The Castro from 3:45 PM to 7:30 PM, needs 60 minutes. Matthew in Richmond District from 7:30 AM to 3:15 PM, minimum 15 minutes. Michelle in Marina District from 10:30 AM to 6:45 PM, 75 minutes. Carol in North Beach 12 PM to 5 PM, 90 minutes. Stephanie in Union Square 10:45 AM to 2:15 PM, 30 minutes. Linda in Golden Gate Park 10:45 AM to 10 PM, 90 minutes.\n\nThe user starts at Sunset District at 9 AM. Let's map out the possible order.\n\nFirst, maybe start with Matthew in Richmond District because he's available until 3:15 PM. But the user starts at Sunset. The travel time from Sunset to Richmond is 12 minutes. So leaving at 9:00 AM, arrive at 9:12 AM. Matthew is available until 3:15 PM. But the user needs only 15 minutes with him. Maybe slot him early. But maybe better to meet someone else first.\n\nAlternatively, Linda is in Golden Gate Park, which is closest to Sunset (11 minutes). She's available from 10:45 AM, but the user arrives at 9 AM. Wait, Linda's available from 10:45 AM. So maybe first meet someone else who is available earlier. Let's check Stephanie in Union Square from 10:45 AM to 2:15 PM. Needs 30 minutes. But travel time from Sunset to Union Square is 30 minutes. So if the user leaves at 9:00, arrives at 9:30. But Stephanie is not available until 10:45. So maybe not possible to meet her first.\n\nMichelle is in Marina District from 10:30 AM. Travel time from Sunset to Marina is 21 minutes. So leaving at 9 AM, arrives at 9:21 AM. But Michelle is available starting at 10:30 AM. So that's a gap. Maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe start with Matthew. Since he's available from 7:30 AM to 3:15 PM. The user arrives at Sunset at 9 AM. Travel to Richmond takes 12 minutes. So arrive at 9:12. Meet Matthew from 9:12 to 9:27 (15 minutes). That works. Then, after that, where to go next?\n\nNext, perhaps go to Golden Gate Park to meet Linda. From Richmond to Golden Gate Park is 9 minutes. So leaving at 9:27, arrive at 9:36. But Linda is available starting at 10:45 AM. So that's too early. So can't meet Linda yet. So maybe after Matthew, go somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, after Matthew, go to Marina District to meet Michelle. From Richmond to Marina is 9 minutes. So leave at 9:27, arrive at 9:36. But Michelle is available from 10:30 AM. So again, too early. Hmm. So maybe after Matthew, the user has some time until others become available.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Matthew, maybe go to Union Square to meet Stephanie. From Richmond to Union Square is 21 minutes. So leaving at 9:27, arrive at 9:48. But Stephanie is available from 10:45 AM. So that's a wait until 10:45. That's a long gap. Maybe not efficient.\n\nWait, maybe the user can meet Linda at Golden Gate Park. Let's see. After Matthew, perhaps go to Golden Gate Park. But Linda is available from 10:45 AM. So maybe plan to arrive at Golden Gate Park at 10:45. Let's calculate.\n\nIf the user meets Matthew from 9:12-9:27, then leaves Richmond. Travel time from Richmond to Golden Gate Park is 9 minutes. So leave at 9:27, arrive at 9:36. But Linda isn't available until 10:45. That's an hour wait. Maybe not ideal. Alternatively, can the user do something else in between?\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Linda first. But Linda is available from 10:45 AM. The user starts at 9 AM. Let's see: Sunset to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. So leave at 9:00, arrive 9:11. But Linda is available from 10:45. So that's a 1h34m wait. Not good. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, after Matthew, go to meet Michelle in Marina District. But Michelle's available at 10:30. So the user can leave Richmond at 9:27, go to Marina (9 minutes travel), arrive at 9:36. Then wait until 10:30 to meet Michelle. That's 54 minutes of waiting. Not ideal. Maybe use that time to meet someone else?\n\nWait, Stephanie is in Union Square from 10:45 AM. Let's see: after meeting Matthew, maybe go to Marina District, but arrive at 9:36, wait until 10:30, meet Michelle for 75 minutes (until 11:45). Then go to Union Square to meet Stephanie. But Stephanie's available until 2:15 PM. Travel from Marina to Union Square is 16 minutes. So leaving Marina at 11:45, arrive Union Square at 12:01 PM. Stephanie is available until 2:15 PM. So meet Stephanie from 12:01 to 12:31 (30 minutes). Then, after that, maybe go to Carol in North Beach. But Carol is available from 12 PM to 5 PM. North Beach is 7 minutes from Union Square? Wait, travel time from Union Square to North Beach is 10 minutes (looking at the matrix: Union Square to North Beach is 10). So leaving Union Square at 12:31, arrive North Beach at 12:41. Then meet Carol for 90 minutes, which would end at 14:11 (2:11 PM). Then, after Carol, maybe go to The Castro to meet Jessica. Let's see: North Beach to The Castro is 20 minutes. So leaving at 2:11 PM, arrive at 2:31 PM. Jessica is available until 7:30 PM, needs 60 minutes. So meet from 2:31 to 3:31 PM. Then, after that, maybe go to Golden Gate Park to meet Linda. The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. So arrive at 3:42 PM. Need 90 minutes, so until 5:12 PM. Then, after that, go to Russian Hill to meet Karen. But Karen is available from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM. So Linda's meeting ends at 5:12 PM. From Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill is 19 minutes. So arrive at 5:31 PM. But Karen isn't available until 8:45 PM. That's a big gap. Maybe there's a way to fit in another meeting? Or maybe adjust the schedule.\n\nWait, let me check if this is feasible. Let's outline the proposed schedule:\n\n1. Meet Matthew in Richmond: 9:12-9:27\n   - Travel from Sunset to Richmond: 12 min (9:00-9:12)\n2. Then travel to Marina (9:27-9:36)\n   - Wait until 10:30, meet Michelle 10:30-11:45 (75 min)\n3. Travel to Union Square (11:45-12:01)\n   - Meet Stephanie 12:01-12:31\n4. Travel to North Beach (12:31-12:41)\n   - Meet Carol 12:41-14:11 (90 min)\n5. Travel to The Castro (14:11-14:31)\n   - Meet Jessica 14:31-15:31\n6. Travel to Golden Gate Park (15:31-15:42)\n   - Meet Linda 15:42-17:12 (90 min)\n7. Then, after 5:12 PM, there's time until Karen's meeting at 8:45 PM. Maybe that's a long gap, but perhaps unavoidable. But can we fit in anything else? Let's see. Also, check if all the times are within the availability.\n\nBut wait, Michelle's available until 6:45 PM. If we finish with her at 11:45, that's within her window (10:30 AM to 6:45 PM). Stephanie's window is until 2:15 PM; meeting her until 12:31 is okay. Carol until 5 PM; meeting until 2:11 PM. Jessica until 7:30 PM; meeting until 3:31 PM. Linda until 10 PM; meeting until 5:12 PM. Then Karen at 8:45 PM.\n\nBut the user has to meet Karen for 60 minutes. So they need to be at Russian Hill from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM. The travel from Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill is 19 minutes. So if they leave Golden Gate Park at 5:12 PM, they can go somewhere else, but Karen is only available at 8:45 PM. So the gap from 5:12 PM to 8:45 PM is 3 hours and 33 minutes. That's a lot of time. Maybe can fit in another meeting? But all other friends' availabilities are checked. Let's see:\n\nMatthew was already met. Michelle's meeting is done. Stephanie done. Carol done. Jessica done. Linda done. Only Karen remains. So perhaps that's the maximum possible. But let's see if there's a way to meet Linda later to reduce the gap.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the order. Let's consider meeting Linda after Karen, but Linda is available until 10 PM. But Karen's meeting is at 8:45-9:45 PM. After that, can the user go to Linda? But the user needs 90 minutes with Linda. If they meet Karen until 9:45 PM, then travel to Golden Gate Park (Russian Hill to Golden Gate Park is 21 minutes). Arrive at 10:06 PM, but Linda is available until 10 PM. So that's too late. So Linda must be met before Karen.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Linda at 5:12 PM, the user has time until 8:45 PM. Maybe can fit in another activity, but all other friends are already met. So perhaps that's the best possible.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a better order. Maybe meet Carol earlier, or adjust the sequence to minimize travel time.\n\nAlternative approach: Start with Matthew (9:12-9:27), then go to Golden Gate Park to meet Linda as soon as she's available. From Richmond to Golden Gate Park is 9 minutes. So leave at 9:27, arrive 9:36. But Linda is available from 10:45. So wait until 10:45. That's 1h9m wait. Not ideal. So maybe meet someone else in between.\n\nAlternatively, after Matthew, go to Union Square to meet Stephanie. But Stephanie is available from 10:45. From Richmond to Union Square is 21 minutes. So leave at 9:27, arrive at 9:48. Then wait until 10:45 (57 minutes). Meet Stephanie 10:45-11:15. Then go to Marina District (Union Square to Marina is 18 minutes). Arrive 11:33. Meet Michelle from 11:33 to 12:48 (75 minutes). Then go to North Beach (Marina to North Beach is 9 minutes). Arrive 12:57. Meet Carol from 12:57-14:27 (90 minutes). Then to The Castro (North Beach to The Castro is 20 minutes). Arrive 14:47. Meet Jessica 14:47-15:47. Then to Golden Gate Park (11 minutes, arrive 15:58). Meet Linda 15:58-17:28. Then to Russian Hill for Karen at 8:45 PM. The gap from 5:28 PM to 8:45 PM is 3h17m. Still a gap but perhaps more efficient.\n\nWait, let's check this alternative schedule:\n\n1. Sunset to Richmond: 9:00-9:12 (travel). Meet Matthew 9:12-9:27.\n2. Richmond to Union Square: 21 min. 9:27-9:48. Wait until 10:45.\n3. Meet Stephanie 10:45-11:15.\n4. Union Square to Marina: 16 min. 11:15-11:31. Meet Michelle 11:31-12:46 (75 min).\n5. Marina to North Beach: 9 min. 12:46-12:55. Meet Carol 12:55-14:25 (90 min).\n6. North Beach to The Castro: 20 min. 14:25-14:45. Meet Jessica 14:45-15:45.\n7. The Castro to Golden Gate Park: 11 min. 15:45-15:56. Meet Linda 15:56-17:26.\n8. Then travel to Russian Hill for Karen. Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill is 19 min. So leave at 17:26, arrive 17:45. But Karen is available from 8:45 PM. So the user has from 17:45 to 20:45 (3h) to do something, but all other friends are already met. So this schedule also includes all possible meetings except Karen, but Karen's meeting is possible at 8:45 PM.\n\nBut wait, in this schedule, the user meets Matthew, Stephanie, Michelle, Carol, Jessica, Linda, and Karen. That's 7 friends. But earlier schedule had 6. Wait, but Karen's meeting is possible here. Let me check the timings again for Karen.\n\nThe user needs to meet Karen from 8:45 PM to 9:45 PM. After meeting Linda until 17:26, the user has to get to Russian Hill by 8:45 PM. So they can leave Golden Gate Park at any time before 8:45 PM minus travel time (19 minutes). So as long as they arrive by 8:45 PM. So in this schedule, after Linda at 17:26, they have time to do other things but all friends are already met. So they can spend the time until 8:26 PM (leave Golden Gate Park at 8:26, arrive Russian Hill at 8:45 PM). Then meet Karen from 8:45 to 9:45 PM. So this would add Karen to the schedule. But in this case, the itinerary would include Karen.\n\nWait, but in this alternative schedule, the user meets Matthew, Stephanie, Michelle, Carol, Jessica, Linda, and Karen. That's all 7 friends. Wait, but originally, the friends are Karen, Jessica, Matthew, Michelle, Carol, Stephanie, Linda. So that's seven people. So this schedule meets all seven. But how?\n\nLet me verify each meeting's timing and availability:\n\n1. Matthew: 9:12-9:27. He's available until 3:15 PM. Yes.\n2. Stephanie: 10:45-11:15. She's available until 2:15 PM. Yes.\n3. Michelle: 11:31-12:46. 75 minutes. She's available until 6:45 PM. Yes.\n4. Carol: 12:55-14:25. 90 minutes. Available until 5 PM. Yes.\n5. Jessica: 14:45-15:45. Available until 7:30 PM. Yes.\n6. Linda: 15:56-17:26. 90 minutes. Available until 10 PM. Yes.\n7. Karen: 20:45-21:45. Her availability is 20:45-21:45. Yes.\n\nTravel times:\n\nAfter meeting Linda at Golden Gate Park until 17:26, the user can stay there or go somewhere else, but needs to reach Russian Hill by 20:45. The travel time from Golden Gate Park to Russian Hill is 19 minutes. So they need to leave Golden Gate Park by 20:26 to arrive at 20:45. So between 17:26 and 20:26, there's about 3 hours. Can they meet anyone else in that time? All other friends are already met. So this schedule allows meeting all seven friends. That seems optimal.\n\nBut let's check if all travel times are correctly accounted for.\n\nFrom Matthew to Stephanie (Richmond to Union Square): 21 minutes. Depart at 9:27, arrive 9:48. Then wait until 10:45. That's correct.\n\nFrom Stephanie to Michelle (Union Square to Marina): 16 minutes. Depart 11:15, arrive 11:31. Yes.\n\nMichelle's meeting ends at 12:46. Travel to North Beach (Marina to North Beach is 9 minutes). Arrive 12:55. Correct.\n\nCarol's meeting ends at 14:25. Travel to The Castro (North Beach to The Castro is 20 minutes). Arrive 14:45. Correct.\n\nJessica's meeting ends at 15:45. Travel to Golden Gate Park (The Castro to GGP is 11 minutes). Arrive 15:56. Correct.\n\nLinda's meeting ends at 17:26. Then, later, travel to Russian Hill (19 minutes) to meet Karen at 20:45. Correct.\n\nThis seems feasible. All meetings are within the availability windows, and the minimum durations are met. The only long gap is after Linda's meeting until Karen's, but since all other friends are already met, this is acceptable. Thus, this schedule meets all seven friends, which is the maximum possible.",
