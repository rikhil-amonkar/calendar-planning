            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule meetings with as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and constraints. The user starts at Marina District at 9:00 AM. Let's list all the people and their availability first.\n\nStephanie: Richmond District, 4:15 PM to 9:30 PM, needs 75 minutes. William: Union Square, 10:45 AM to 5:30 PM, 45 min. Elizabeth: Nob Hill, 12:15 PM to 3 PM, 105 min. Joseph: Fisherman's Wharf, 12:45 PM to 2 PM, 75 min. That's a tight window. Anthony: Golden Gate Park, 1 PM to 8:30 PM, 75 min. Barbara: Embarcadero, 7:15 PM to 8:30 PM, 75 min. Carol: Financial District, 11:45 AM to 4:15 PM, 60 min. Sandra: North Beach, 10 AM to 12:30 PM, 15 min. Kenneth: Presidio, 9:15 PM to 10:15 PM, 45 min.\n\nFirst, the earliest meeting is Sandra at North Beach from 10 AM. Let's check the travel time from Marina to North Beach. The distance is 9 minutes. So leaving Marina at 9:00, arrive at 9:09. But Sandra is available starting at 10 AM. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, Sandra's available from 10 AM to 12:30 PM. So the earliest we can meet her is at 10 AM. But we start at Marina at 9 AM. So maybe do something else first? But who else is available before 10 AM? Let's check others. William is available from 10:45 AM. So maybe first meet Sandra at 10 AM. But to get to North Beach from Marina at 9:00, travel time is 9 minutes. Arrive at 9:09. But Sandra's not available until 10. So that's a gap. Wait, maybe we can meet someone else first. Let's see. Are there any people available before 10 AM? Let's check:\n\nJoseph starts at 12:45 PM. Elizabeth at 12:15 PM. William at 10:45 AM. So the earliest possible meetings after 9 AM are Sandra (10 AM), then William (10:45). So maybe start with Sandra.\n\nSo, Marina to North Beach: 9 minutes. Leave Marina at 9:50 to arrive at 10:00? Wait, but arrival time. Let's think. To meet Sandra at 10:00 AM, need to arrive by 10:00. So departure from Marina at 9:51 (9 minutes travel). But the user arrives at Marina at 9:00 AM. So maybe they can leave Marina at 9:51, arrive at North Beach at 10:00. Meet Sandra for 15 minutes. Then end at 10:15. Next, where to go? Let's see.\n\nNext, William is available from 10:45 AM. So from Sandra's meeting ending at 10:15 AM, travel to Union Square. North Beach to Union Square is 7 minutes. So leave at 10:15, arrive 10:22. But William's available at 10:45. Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps there's a gap here. Alternatively, maybe adjust the meeting time with Sandra to end earlier so that we can reach William by 10:45. Wait, but William starts at 10:45. So if we meet Sandra from 10:00 to 10:15, then travel to Union Square takes 7 minutes (North Beach to Union Square). Arrive at 10:22. Then wait until 10:45 to meet William. That's 23 minutes of waiting. That's not efficient. Alternatively, could we adjust Sandra's meeting to a shorter time? But the minimum is 15 minutes, so that's already met. Alternatively, maybe meet William first if possible. Let's check.\n\nWilliam is available from 10:45 AM. To meet him first, need to get from Marina to Union Square. Travel time is 16 minutes. So leaving Marina at 9:00, arrive at 9:16 AM. But William isn't available until 10:45. So that's a long wait. Not efficient. So perhaps better to meet Sandra first.\n\nAfter Sandra at 10:15, maybe go to Carol next. Carol is at Financial District from 11:45 AM. Let's see. Current time after Sandra is 10:15. Let's see where else is possible between 10:15 and 11:45. Maybe Carol isn't available yet. Carol's window starts at 11:45. So maybe after Sandra, go to William. Let's check travel time from North Beach to Union Square: 7 minutes. So leaving at 10:15, arrive at 10:22. But William's window starts at 10:45. So we can wait until 10:45. So meet William from 10:45 to 11:30 (45 minutes). Then leave Union Square.\n\nNext, maybe Carol at Financial District. Union Square to Financial District is 9 minutes (Union Square's entry says Financial District is 9 minutes away). Wait, looking at the travel times: Union Square to Financial District is 9 minutes. So leaving Union Square at 11:30, arrive at Financial District at 11:39. Carol is available from 11:45, so need to wait until 11:45. So start meeting Carol at 11:45, for 60 minutes, ending at 12:45 PM.\n\nThen, next is Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf from 12:45 PM to 2 PM. Need 75 minutes. But Joseph's window is 12:45-2:00, which is 75 minutes. So exactly fits. So after Carol ends at 12:45, need to travel from Financial District to Fisherman's Wharf. Travel time is 10 minutes (Financial District to Fisherman's Wharf). Leaving at 12:45, arrive at 12:55. But Joseph's window ends at 2 PM. So meet from 12:55 to 2:00 PM. That's 65 minutes, but he needs 75. Wait, that's a problem. Joseph's window is 12:45-2:00 (75 minutes), but if we arrive at 12:55, we can only meet until 2:00, which is 65 minutes. Not enough. So that's a conflict. So this plan won't work.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe adjust the order. Let's see. After Carol at 11:45-12:45, perhaps go to Elizabeth at Nob Hill. Elizabeth is available from 12:15 PM to 3 PM. She needs 105 minutes, which is 1h45m. So 12:45 PM to 2:30 PM would be 1h45m. But let's check travel time from Financial District to Nob Hill. Financial District to Nob Hill is 8 minutes. Leaving Financial District at 12:45, arrive at 12:53. Then meet from 12:53 to 2:38 PM (105 minutes). But Elizabeth's window ends at 3 PM, so 2:38 is okay. But then Joseph's window is 12:45-2:00 PM. If we do this, we miss Joseph. Alternatively, maybe Joseph has a shorter window. Since Joseph is only available until 2 PM, and needs 75 minutes, we have to meet him within his window. So perhaps after Carol, go to Joseph. But as earlier, that leaves us only 65 minutes. Not enough. So maybe meet Joseph first, then Carol? Let's check.\n\nWait, Carol is available from 11:45 AM. If after meeting William (10:45-11:30), can we meet Carol from 11:30+travel time. Union Square to Financial District is 9 minutes. So arrive at 11:39. Carol starts at 11:45. So meet Carol from 11:45-12:45 (60 minutes). Then go to Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf. Financial District to Fisherman's Wharf is 10 minutes. Arrive at 12:55. Joseph's window ends at 2 PM. So meet from 12:55-2:00, 65 minutes. Not enough. So Joseph's meeting can't be done here. So maybe we need to skip Joseph. Alternatively, adjust the schedule to meet Joseph first. Let's see.\n\nAlternative plan: After Sandra, go to Joseph. But Sandra is at North Beach until 12:30 PM. Let's see. Wait, Sandra's available until 12:30 PM. So if we meet Sandra from 10:00-10:15, then go to Joseph. But Joseph's available starts at 12:45 PM. That's a big gap. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps meet Sandra later. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at all the people and their time windows and required durations. Maybe prioritize those with tighter windows. Joseph's window is 12:45-2:00 PM (75 minutes exactly). He needs 75 minutes, so only possible to meet him in that window. So we have to schedule him exactly 12:45-2:00 PM. So that's a fixed block. But how to fit that.\n\nElizabeth needs 105 minutes (1h45m) from 12:15 PM to 3 PM. That's 2h45m window, but she needs a long meeting. So maybe schedule her from 12:15 PM to 2:00 PM (105 minutes). But that would conflict with Joseph's 12:45-2 PM. So overlapping. So can't do both. So need to choose between Elizabeth and Joseph. But the user wants to meet as many friends as possible. So perhaps if possible, meet both.\n\nWait, let's see. If we meet Elizabeth from 12:15 PM to 2:00 PM (105 min), then Joseph's window is 12:45-2:00 PM. So overlapping. But Joseph's meeting is 75 minutes. If we start Joseph at 12:45 PM and meet until 2:00 PM, that's exactly 75 minutes. But how can we be in two places at once? Impossible. So the user has to choose between Elizabeth and Joseph. Since Joseph's window is exactly the required time, and Elizabeth's is longer, perhaps prioritize Joseph. But maybe there's a way to split the schedule. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Elizabeth after Joseph. But Joseph ends at 2 PM. Then go to Elizabeth. But Elizabeth's window ends at 3 PM. So from 2 PM, travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill. Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 10 minutes (from the table: Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. Wait, checking the data: Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill: 11 minutes. So leaving at 2:00 PM, arrive at 2:11 PM. Meet Elizabeth from 2:11 to 3:00 PM. That's 49 minutes, which is less than the required 105. So not enough. So Elizabeth can't be met after Joseph.\n\nAlternatively, meet Elizabeth first. From 12:15 PM to 2:00 PM. Then go to Joseph. But Joseph's window is 12:45 PM to 2 PM. So overlapping. Can't do that. So it's impossible to meet both. Therefore, the user has to choose one. Let's see which one is possible.\n\nIf we prioritize Joseph, then his meeting is 12:45-2:00 PM. Then, after that, maybe meet Anthony at Golden Gate Park. Anthony is available from 1 PM to 8:30 PM. Needs 75 minutes. So if we meet Joseph until 2 PM, then travel to Golden Gate Park. Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park is 25 minutes. Arrive at 2:25 PM. Meet Anthony from 2:25 PM to 3:40 PM (75 minutes). Then, after that, maybe go to Elizabeth? But Elizabeth's window ends at 3 PM. So no. So Elizabeth can't be met. Alternatively, maybe meet Anthony later. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after Joseph, go to Anthony. Then, after Anthony, maybe meet Barbara at Embarcadero from 7:15 PM. Then Stephanie at Richmond District from 4:15 PM. Let's see.\n\nSo after Joseph ends at 2 PM, travel to Golden Gate Park (25 mins), arrive at 2:25. Meet Anthony from 2:25 to 3:40 (75 mins). Then, from Golden Gate Park, next possible meetings: Barbara at Embarcadero from 7:15 PM. Between 3:40 and 7:15 PM, there's time. Let's see if we can fit others.\n\nBut Elizabeth's window ends at 3 PM, so she's out. Carol's window ends at 4:15 PM. If after Anthony ends at 3:40, maybe go to Carol. Carol is at Financial District until 4:15 PM. Golden Gate Park to Financial District is 26 minutes. So leaving at 3:40, arrive at 4:06. Meet Carol from 4:06 to 4:15 (9 minutes). Not enough. So Carol can't be met here. So Carol needs to be met earlier. Let's check earlier options.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting William (10:45-11:30), instead of meeting Carol, maybe meet Elizabeth. Let's see. From Union Square, travel to Nob Hill. Union Square to Nob Hill is 9 minutes. Arrive at 11:39. Elizabeth is available from 12:15 PM. So need to wait until 12:15 PM. Then meet her from 12:15 to 2:00 PM (105 minutes). But that would overlap with Joseph's window. So again, conflicting.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's list the possible meetings and their required times, and see which can be scheduled.\n\nPossible Meetings:\n1. Sandra (North Beach): 10:00-10:15 (15 min)\n2. William (Union Square): 10:45-11:30 (45 min)\n3. Carol (Financial District): 11:45-12:45 (60 min)\n4. Joseph (Fisherman's Wharf): 12:45-2:00 (75 min)\n5. Anthony (Golden Gate Park): 2:00-3:15 (75 min)\n6. Stephanie (Richmond District): 4:15-5:30 PM (75 min)\n7. Barbara (Embarcadero): 7:15-8:30 PM (75 min)\n8. Kenneth (Presidio): 9:15-10:00 PM (45 min)\n\nBut wait, Stephanie's available from 4:15 PM to 9:30 PM. So if we meet her after Barbara? Let's see.\n\nAfter Anthony ends at 3:40 PM (if scheduled from 2:25-3:40), then travel to Stephanie at Richmond District. Golden Gate Park to Richmond District is 7 minutes. So arrive at 3:47 PM. But Stephanie's available at 4:15 PM. Wait, but that's possible. Meet her from 4:15-5:30 PM. Then after that, go to Barbara at Embarcadero from 7:15-8:30 PM. Then Kenneth at 9:15 PM. Let's check travel times.\n\nStephanie ends at 5:30 PM. Richmond District to Embarcadero is 19 minutes. So leaving at 5:30, arrive at 5:49 PM. Barbara's available from 7:15 PM. So there's time between 5:49 and 7:15. Maybe have dinner or something, but that's free time. Then meet Barbara from 7:15-8:30 PM. Then Embarcadero to Presidio is 20 minutes. Leave at 8:30, arrive at 8:50 PM. Kenneth's available from 9:15 PM. So wait until 9:15 PM, meet him until 10:00 PM (45 minutes). That works.\n\nBut let's check if this schedule fits all the required people:\n\nSandra (done), William (done), Carol (done?), Joseph (done?), Anthony (done), Stephanie (done), Barbara (done), Kenneth (done). But wait, in this plan, Carol wasn't included. Oh, right, in this hypothetical plan, Carol was skipped. So where would Carol fit in?\n\nIn the earlier steps, after William (11:30), we need to meet Carol. Let's re-examine. William ends at 11:30 AM. Union Square to Financial District is 9 minutes. Arrive at 11:39. Carol's available from 11:45 AM. So meet Carol from 11:45 AM to 12:45 PM (60 minutes). Then, Financial District to Fisherman's Wharf is 10 minutes. Arrive at 12:55 PM. Joseph's window is until 2 PM. Meet from 12:55 to 2:00 PM (65 minutes). Not enough. So Joseph can't be met. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if we skip Joseph to meet Carol and others, but the user wants to meet as many as possible. So maybe the optimal schedule includes:\n\nSandra, William, Carol, Anthony, Stephanie, Barbara, Kenneth. That's 7 people. But Joseph and Elizabeth are not met. Alternatively, if we can fit Joseph instead of Carol, but then Carol's not met. So which is better? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting Sandra and William, go to Joseph instead of Carol. Let's try:\n\nSandra (10-10:15). Then North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf? Wait, Joseph is available from 12:45 PM. So that's too early. Wait, Sandra ends at 10:15. Next, go to William at Union Square (10:45). So that's the same as before. After William ends at 11:30 AM, then go to Joseph. Union Square to Fisherman's Wharf is 15 minutes. Arrive at 11:45. But Joseph's available starts at 12:45 PM. So that's too early. So can't meet Joseph yet. So maybe go to Carol from 11:45 AM. So Union Square to Financial District (9 mins), arrive at 11:39. Meet Carol from 11:45 to 12:45. Then go to Joseph. But as before, arrive at 12:55, which gives only 65 minutes. So Joseph's meeting is not possible.\n\nAlternative idea: Skip Carol to meet Joseph. So after William (11:30), go to Fisherman's Wharf. Union Square to Fisherman's Wharf is 15 minutes. Arrive at 11:45. But Joseph starts at 12:45. So we have to wait an hour. Not feasible. So perhaps Joseph can't be met unless we adjust the schedule.\n\nHmm. Maybe the optimal schedule is to meet Sandra, William, Carol, Anthony, Stephanie, Barbara, and Kenneth. That's 7 people. Elizabeth and Joseph are skipped due to time conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to fit Elizabeth? Let's see.\n\nIf after Carol (12:45), go to Nob Hill. Financial District to Nob Hill is 8 minutes. Arrive at 12:53. Meet Elizabeth from 12:53 to 2:38 (105 minutes). But her window ends at 3 PM, so that's okay. Then after that, go to Anthony. Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park is 17 minutes. So leave at 2:38, arrive at 2:55. Meet Anthony from 2:55 to 4:10 PM (75 mins). Then, Golden Gate Park to Richmond District (Stephanie) is 7 minutes. Arrive at 4:17 PM. Meet Stephanie from 4:15 PM to 5:30 PM (75 mins). Then to Barbara at Embarcadero: Richmond to Embarcadero is 19 mins. Arrive at 5:49. Barbara is available from 7:15 PM. Then go to Barbara, then Kenneth. This way, we meet Elizabeth, Anthony, Stephanie, Barbara, Kenneth, Sandra, William, Carol. That's 8 people. But where does Joseph fit? Not here. So Joseph is skipped, but Elizabeth is included. But this requires adjusting.\n\nWait, let's outline this plan:\n\n1. Marina start at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet Sandra at North Beach: 10:00-10:15 (travel 9 mins from Marina).\n3. Travel to Union Square (7 mins): arrive 10:22. Wait until 10:45.\n4. Meet William: 10:45-11:30.\n5. Travel to Financial District (9 mins): arrive 11:39. Meet Carol 11:45-12:45.\n6. Travel to Nob Hill (8 mins): arrive 12:53. Meet Elizabeth 12:53-2:38 (105 mins).\n7. Travel to Golden Gate Park (17 mins): arrive 2:55. Meet Anthony 2:55-4:10.\n8. Travel to Richmond District (7 mins): arrive 4:17. Meet Stephanie 4:15-5:30 (but arrival is 4:17, so start at 4:17? But Stephanie's window starts at 4:15. So start at 4:17, end at 5:32. But Stephanie's window ends at 9:30 PM. So that's okay. But need to meet for 75 mins. 4:17 to 5:32 is 75 mins. So possible.\n9. Travel to Embarcadero (19 mins): arrive 5:51. Barbara's window starts at 7:15. Wait until 7:15, meet until 8:30.\n10. Travel to Presidio (20 mins): arrive 8:50. Wait until 9:15. Meet Kenneth 9:15-10:00.\n\nThis way, we meet Sandra, William, Carol, Elizabeth, Anthony, Stephanie, Barbara, and Kenneth. 8 people. Joseph is missed. But is this feasible?\n\nCheck the travel times and overlaps:\n\n- After Carol ends at 12:45 PM, travel to Nob Hill (8 mins), arrive 12:53. Meet Elizabeth until 2:38. Then travel to Golden Gate Park (17 mins), arrive 2:55. Meet Anthony until 4:10. Then travel to Richmond District (7 mins), arrive 4:17. Meet until 5:32. Then to Embarcadero (19 mins), arrive 5:51. Then Barbara at 7:15. Then to Presidio (20 mins), arrive 8:50. Then meet Kenneth at 9:15.\n\nThis seems feasible. So in this case, Joseph is skipped, but we meet more people. But the user's goal is to meet as many as possible, so this is better. But let's check if the time slots are correct.\n\nElizabeth's meeting: 12:53-2:38 (105 mins). Yes. Anthony's: 2:55-4:10 (75 mins). Stephanie's: 4:17-5:32 (75 mins). Barbara's: 7:15-8:30 (75 mins). Kenneth's: 9:15-10:00 (45 mins). All time windows respected.\n\nBut wait, the user arrives at Marina at 9 AM. To meet Sandra at 10 AM, they need to leave Marina at 9:51 (9 mins travel). So itinerary starts at 10:00.\n\nBut what about the initial travel from Marina to North Beach? The user is at Marina at 9:00 AM. They need to leave by 9:51 to arrive at North Beach at 10:00. So the first entry is:\n\n{\"action\": \"meet\", \"location\": \"North Beach\", \"person\": \"Sandra\", \"start_time\": \"10:00\", \"end_time\": \"10:15\"}\n\nThen, travel to Union Square takes 7 mins, arriving at 10:22. Wait until 10:45. Then meet William from 10:45-11:30. Then travel to Financial District (9 mins), arrive 11:39. Meet Carol from 11:45-12:45. Then to Nob Hill (8 mins), arrive 12:53. Meet Elizabeth until 2:38. Then to Golden Gate Park (17 mins), arrive 2:55. Meet Anthony until 4:10. Then to Richmond District (7 mins), arrive 4:17. Meet Stephanie until 5:32. Then to Embarcadero (19 mins), arrive 5:51. Wait until 7:15. Meet Barbara until 8:30. Then to Presidio (20 mins), arrive 8:50. Wait until 9:15. Meet Kenneth until 10:00.\n\nThis seems to work. So the itinerary includes 8 people. Joseph is skipped because his window is too tight and conflicts with Elizabeth. But meeting 8 is better than 7. So this is a better plan.\n\nAnother check: Travel times. From Golden Gate Park to Richmond District is 7 minutes (Golden Gate Park's entry to Richmond District: 7 mins). Yes. From Richmond District to Embarcadero is 19 mins. Yes. From Embarcadero to Presidio is 20 mins. Yes.\n\nNow, let's verify each meeting's time against their availability:\n\n- Sandra: 10-10:15 (within 10 AM to 12:30 PM)\n- William: 10:45-11:30 (within 10:45 AM to 5:30 PM)\n- Carol: 11:45-12:45 (within 11:45 AM to 4:15 PM)\n- Elizabeth: 12:53-2:38 (within 12:15 PM to 3 PM)\n- Anthony: 2:55-4:10 (within 1 PM to 8:30 PM)\n- Stephanie: 4:17-5:32 (within 4:15 PM to 9:30 PM)\n- Barbara: 7:15-8:30 (within 7:15 PM to 8:30 PM)\n- Kenneth: 9:15-10:00 (within 9:15 PM to 10:15 PM)\n\nAll meetings are within the time windows and meet the minimum duration requirements.\n\nThus, this itinerary meets 8 people, which is the maximum possible given the constraints.",
