            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and their availability. The user starts at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. Let's list all the friends with their constraints:\n\n- **Stephanie** at Presidio from 7:30 AM to 10:15 AM, needs 60 minutes. Since we arrive at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM, and Presidio is 20 minutes away, earliest arrival there is 9:20 AM. But Stephanie's available until 10:15 AM. So 9:20 to 10:15 gives us 55 minutes, which is less than the required 60. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, travel time from Embarcadero to Presidio is 20 minutes. So leaving Embarcadero at 9:00, arrives at 9:20. Stephanie is available until 10:15 AM. So possible meeting time is 9:20 to 10:15 (55 minutes). Not enough. So maybe Stephanie can't be met? But the minimum is 60. Hmm. Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. The user arrives at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. To get to Presidio, it's 20 minutes, arriving at 9:20. Stephanie's available until 10:15, so the meeting could be from 9:20 to 10:15, which is 55 minutes. That's 5 minutes short. So maybe Stephanie is not possible. Wait, but maybe the user can leave earlier? But no, the user arrives at Embarcadero at 9:00. So Stephanie's slot might not be possible. But perhaps the user can leave immediately at 9:00, travel 20 minutes, arriving at 9:20, meet until 10:15 (55 minutes), which is under the required 60. So Stephanie might not be possible. But the user wants to meet as many as possible. Maybe the assistant can adjust. Wait, maybe the user can meet Stephanie from 9:20 to 10:20, but she's only available until 10:15. So that's a problem. So perhaps Stephanie can't be met. Let's note that.\n\nNext, **Brian** at Marina District from 12:15 PM to 6:00 PM, needs 60 minutes. Let's see. After handling others, maybe we can fit him in.\n\n**Thomas** at Fisherman's Wharf from 1:30 PM to 7:00 PM, needs 30 minutes.\n\n**Nancy** at North Beach from 2:45 PM to 8:00 PM, needs 15 minutes.\n\n**Jessica** at Nob Hill from 4:30 PM to 6:45 PM, needs 120 minutes. That's a big chunk. Needs to be scheduled in that window.\n\n**Mary** at Union Square from 4:45 PM to 9:30 PM, 60 minutes.\n\n**Charles** at The Castro from 4:30 PM to 10 PM, needs 105 minutes.\n\n**Sarah** at Alamo Square from 8 PM to 9:45 PM, needs 105 minutes. But 8 PM to 9:45 is 105 minutes, so exactly. So she can only be met from 8-9:45 PM, but travel time must be considered if coming from somewhere else.\n\n**Karen** at Chinatown from 7:15 PM to 9:15 PM, 90 minutes.\n\n**Matthew** at Bayview from 7:15 PM to 10 PM, 120 minutes.\n\nSo the main challenge is fitting in Jessica's 2 hours, Charles' 1h45m, Sarah's 1h45m (which exactly fits her window), Matthew's 2 hours, Karen's 1.5h, and others.\n\nStarting from Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. Let's see if Stephanie is possible. Since Stephanie's window is 7:30-10:15 AM, but arrival at Presidio at 9:20, meeting until 10:15 gives 55 minutes. Not enough. So skip Stephanie.\n\nNext, let's look at the earliest possible meetings. After 9 AM, the next available person is Brian at Marina District starting at 12:15 PM. So maybe we can plan the morning with someone else, but Stephanie might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to meet someone else in the morning. Let's check other friends' availability:\n\nLooking at the times:\n\n- All others start in the afternoon or evening. So perhaps after 9 AM until 12:15 PM, there's a gap. Maybe Brian is the first possible after 12:15 PM.\n\nSo let's plan the day starting with Brian.\n\nBut wait, let's check travel times. From Embarcadero to Marina District is 12 minutes. So if we leave Embarcadero at 12:03 PM, arrive at 12:15 PM. But Brian is available from 12:15 PM to 6 PM. So meeting Brian from 12:15 PM to 1:15 PM (60 minutes). Then leave Marina District at 1:15 PM.\n\nNext, Thomas at Fisherman's Wharf. From Marina District to Fisherman's Wharf is 9 minutes (checking the travel times: Marina District to Fisherman's Wharf is 10 minutes. Wait, the data says Fisherman's Wharf to Marina District is 9, but Marina District to Fisherman's Wharf? Let me check: Looking at the travel times under Marina District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10 minutes. So leaving Marina District at 1:15, arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 1:25. Thomas is available until 7 PM. So meet from 1:25 to 1:55 (30 minutes). Then leave at 1:55.\n\nNext, Nancy at North Beach. From Fisherman's Wharf to North Beach is 6 minutes (Fisherman's Wharf to North Beach: 6). Arrive at 2:01 PM. Nancy is available from 2:45 PM. Wait, Nancy is available from 2:45 PM. So we can't meet her until 2:45. So there's a gap here. Let's adjust. Maybe after meeting Thomas, we can go to North Beach but have to wait until 2:45. Alternatively, can we schedule someone else in between?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after Brian, go to Thomas first, then Nancy. Let's see:\n\nBrian at Marina District from 12:15-1:15. Then travel to Fisherman's Wharf (10 minutes) arrives at 1:25. Meet Thomas 1:25-1:55 (30 mins). Then from Fisherman's Wharf to North Beach is 6 mins, arrive at 2:01 PM. But Nancy is available from 2:45. So we have to wait until 2:45. That's a 44-minute gap. Maybe that's acceptable. Then meet Nancy from 2:45-3:00 (15 mins). Then leave North Beach at 3:00.\n\nNext, Jessica at Nob Hill from 4:30 PM. So between 3:00 PM and 4:30 PM, there's 1.5 hours. But need to travel from North Beach to Nob Hill. North Beach to Nob Hill is 7 minutes (travel time: North Beach to Nob Hill is 7). So leaving at 3:00, arrive at 3:07. But Jessica isn't available until 4:30. So there's a 1h23m gap. Maybe we can meet someone else here? Let's check other friends available in that window.\n\nMary at Union Square from 4:45 PM. So perhaps after Jessica. Wait, Jessica's window is 4:30-6:45 PM. She needs 120 minutes. So ideally, meet Jessica from 4:30-6:30 PM. Then travel to Mary at Union Square (Nob Hill to Union Square is 7 minutes, per travel times: Nob Hill to Union Square is 7). Arrive at 6:37. Mary is available until 9:30 PM. Meet Mary from 6:37-7:37 (60 mins). Then after that, maybe head to others.\n\nBut then after Jessica, there's Mary. Then, after Mary, need to meet Karen (Chinatown 7:15-9:15 PM, 90 mins), Matthew (Bayview 7:15-10 PM, 120 mins), Sarah (Alamo Square 8-9:45 PM, 105 mins), Charles (The Castro 4:30-10 PM, 105 mins). Let's see.\n\nBut let's outline the schedule so far:\n\n- 12:15-1:15: Brian (Marina)\n- 1:25-1:55: Thomas (Fisherman's)\n- 2:45-3:00: Nancy (North Beach)\n- 4:30-6:30: Jessica (Nob Hill)\n- 6:37-7:37: Mary (Union Square)\n\nNow, after 7:37 PM, need to fit Karen, Matthew, Sarah, Charles.\n\nKaren's at Chinatown from 7:15 PM. Needs 90 mins. So possible slot 7:15-8:45 PM. But Mary ends at 7:37. Travel from Union Square to Chinatown is 7 minutes (Union Square to Chinatown is 7). Arrive at 7:44. So Karen's meeting could be 7:44-9:14 (90 mins), but Karen's available until 9:15. That works. But then after that, need to meet others.\n\nMatthew needs 120 mins at Bayview from 7:15 PM. If we start at 7:15 PM, but we're meeting Karen until 9:14, then can't meet Matthew until after 9:14. But Matthew's available until 10 PM. Travel from Chinatown to Bayview is 20 mins. Arrive at 9:34. Meet until 10:00, which is 26 minutes. Not enough. So maybe Matthew can't be met if we do Karen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe prioritize Matthew over Karen. Let's see:\n\nAfter Mary ends at 7:37, travel from Union Square to Bayview. Travel time is 15 mins (Union Square to Bayview is 18 minutes). Wait, Union Square to Bayview is 18 mins. So leave at 7:37, arrive at 7:55. Meet Matthew from 7:55-9:55 (120 mins). But Matthew's available until 10 PM. So that works. Then after that, travel to Karen's location (Bayview to Chinatown is 19 mins). Arrive at 10:14 PM, but Karen's available until 9:15 PM. So that's too late. So Karen can't be met if we choose Matthew.\n\nAlternatively, after Mary, go to Karen first. From Union Square to Chinatown is 7 mins. Arrive at 7:44. Meet Karen 7:44-9:14 (90 mins). Then travel to Bayview (Chinatown to Bayview is 19 mins). Arrive at 9:33. Meet Matthew from 9:33-10:00 (27 mins). Not enough. So can't meet both Karen and Matthew.\n\nSo the choice here is between Karen (90 mins) and Matthew (120 mins). Since Matthew requires more time but is available later, maybe prioritize him. But let's check other possibilities.\n\nAnother option: After Jessica (ends 6:30 PM), instead of meeting Mary, go to Charles at The Castro. Jessica is at Nob Hill. Nob Hill to The Castro is 17 mins (Nob Hill to The Castro is 17). Arrive at 6:47 PM. Charles needs 105 mins (1h45m). So meet from 6:47-8:32 PM. Then travel to Sarah at Alamo Square (The Castro to Alamo Square is 8 mins). Arrive 8:40 PM. Sarah's available until 9:45 PM. So meet from 8:40-9:45 (65 mins), which is less than her required 105. Not enough. Alternatively, maybe after Charles, go to Sarah but can't meet the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, if we meet Charles from 6:47-8:32, then go to Alamo Square (8 mins, arrive 8:40). Sarah needs 105 mins, but her window ends at 9:45. So 8:40-9:45 is 65 mins. Not enough. So Sarah can't be met in this case.\n\nAlternatively, after Jessica, go to Mary first. Meet Mary from 6:37-7:37. Then, go to Charles. Union Square to The Castro is 17 mins. Arrive at 7:54. Meet until 9:39 (105 mins). Then leave for Sarah. The Castro to Alamo Square is 8 mins. Arrive 9:47, which is after Sarah's 9:45 end time. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after Mary, go to Charles. From Union Square to The Castro is 17 mins. Arrive at 7:54. Meet until 9:39. Then Sarah is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe skip Mary and meet Charles instead. Let's see:\n\nAfter Jessica (ends 6:30 PM), go to Charles. Nob Hill to The Castro is 17 mins. Arrive 6:47. Meet until 8:32 (105 mins). Then go to Alamo Square (8 mins, arrive 8:40). Sarah's window is 8-9:45. So meet from 8:40-9:45 (65 mins). Not enough. Then after that, go to Karen at Chinatown (Alamo Square to Chinatown is 15 mins. Arrive 10:00, which is after her 9:15 end time. No.\n\nAlternatively, after Charles, go to Karen. The Castro to Chinatown is 22 mins. Arrive at 8:54. Karen's available until 9:15. Meet from 8:54-9:15 (21 mins). Not enough. So that's not feasible.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to outline possible combinations.\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Brian (12:15-1:15)\n- Thomas (1:25-1:55)\n- Nancy (2:45-3:00)\n- Jessica (4:30-6:30)\n- Mary (6:37-7:37)\n- Matthew (7:55-9:55) [needs 120 mins, ends at 9:55]\n\nBut then Karen and Sarah can't be met. Also, Charles. So total friends met: Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, Matthew. That's 6. But let's see if others can be added.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Brian (12:15-1:15)\n- Thomas (1:25-1:55)\n- Nancy (2:45-3:00)\n- Jessica (4:30-6:30)\n- Charles (6:47-8:32)\n- Sarah (8:40-9:45) [65 mins, insufficient]\n- Karen: No\n\nBut Sarah's time is insufficient. So not valid.\n\nOption 3:\n\n- Brian (12:15-1:15)\n- Thomas (1:25-1:55)\n- Nancy (2:45-3:00)\n- Jessica (4:30-6:30)\n- Karen (7:15-8:45) [but how to get there?]\n\nWait, after Jessica ends at 6:30, need to travel to Chinatown. Nob Hill to Chinatown is 6 mins. So leave at 6:30, arrive at 6:36. Karen's available from 7:15. So wait until 7:15. Then meet Karen from 7:15-8:45 (90 mins). Then after that, go to Matthew. Chinatown to Bayview is 19 mins. Arrive at 8:54. Meet until 10:54, but Matthew's available until 10 PM. So 8:54-10:00 is 66 mins. Not enough. Alternatively, skip Matthew and go to Sarah. Chinatown to Alamo Square is 15 mins. Arrive at 9:00. Sarah's available until 9:45. Meet from 9:00-9:45 (45 mins). Also insufficient. So Karen and Sarah can't both be met. \n\nAlternatively, after Karen, go to Charles. Chinatown to The Castro is 22 mins. Arrive at 8:54. Meet until 10:00 (66 mins, needs 105). No.\n\nOption 4:\n\nMaybe skip Mary and meet Charles instead. After Jessica (6:30 PM), go to Charles. Nob Hill to The Castro (17 mins), arrive 6:47. Meet until 8:32 (105 mins). Then go to Alamo Square (8 mins, arrive 8:40). Meet Sarah until 9:45 (65 mins). Not enough. Then go to Matthew? Alamo Square to Bayview is 16 mins. Arrive 9:56, but Matthew is available until 10 PM. Meet 9:56-10:00 (4 mins). Not enough. So this gives Charles and partial Sarah, which doesn't meet requirements.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see which friends have the tightest windows. Sarah's window is exactly her required time (8-9:45 PM, 105 mins). So she must be met exactly during her window. So we need to arrive at Alamo Square by 8 PM. Travel time to Alamo Square from previous location must be considered.\n\nSimilarly, Karen's window is 7:15-9:15 PM (120 mins), needs 90 mins. So she can be met from 7:15-8:45, for example.\n\nMatthew's window is 7:15-10 PM, needs 120 mins. He can be met from 7:15-9:15, for example.\n\nJessica needs 120 mins from 4:30-6:45 PM. So she must be met from 4:30-6:30.\n\nSo maybe schedule Jessica from 4:30-6:30, then go to Mary (Union Square) from 6:37-7:37. Then from there, go to either Karen or Matthew or Charles.\n\nLet's try:\n\nJessica: 4:30-6:30 PM (Nob Hill)\n\nTravel to Union Square: Nob Hill to Union Square is 7 mins. Arrive 6:37.\n\nMary: 6:37-7:37 PM (Union Square)\n\nThen, from Union Square, options:\n\nOption A: Go to Matthew (Bayview). Union Square to Bayview is 18 mins. Arrive 7:55. Meet until 9:55 (120 mins). Possible. Then after that, travel to Sarah (Bayview to Alamo Square is 16 mins. Arrive 10:11 PM, which is after her 9:45 PM end time. So Sarah can't be met. \n\nOption B: Go to Karen (Chinatown). Union Square to Chinatown is 7 mins. Arrive 7:44. Meet until 9:14. Then go to Matthew. Chinatown to Bayview is 19 mins. Arrive 9:33. Meet until 10:00 (27 mins). Not enough. \n\nOption C: Go to Charles (The Castro). Union Square to The Castro is 17 mins. Arrive 7:54. Meet until 9:39 (105 mins). Then go to Sarah: The Castro to Alamo Square is 8 mins. Arrive 9:47. Too late. \n\nOption D: After Mary, go to Sarah. Union Square to Alamo Square is 15 mins. Arrive 7:52. Sarah's window starts at 8 PM. So wait until 8 PM. Meet from 8-9:45 PM (exactly 105 mins). Then after that, go to Matthew. Alamo Square to Bayview is 16 mins. Arrive 10:01 PM. Too late. \n\nBut Sarah's meeting is fixed from 8-9:45. Then after that, no time for others. \n\nAlternatively, after Mary, go to Matthew. Meet Matthew from 7:55-9:55. Then go to Sarah? Can't. Or Karen? \n\nIf we choose to meet Matthew, then Karen and Sarah can't be met. If we choose to meet Sarah, then Matthew can't be met. \n\nAlternatively, after Mary, go to Karen (7:44-9:14), then to Sarah. Chinatown to Alamo Square is 15 mins. Arrive 9:29. Meet until 9:45 (16 mins). Not enough. \n\nSo it's a trade-off between meeting Matthew (120 mins) or meeting Sarah (105 mins) and Karen (90 mins). \n\nLet's count the total time used:\n\nOption A (Matthew):\n\nFriends met: Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, Matthew. That's 6 friends. Total time: 60 +30 +15 +120 +60 +120 = 405 mins.\n\nOption D (Sarah):\n\nFriends met: Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, Sarah. That's 6. Total time: 60 +30 +15 +120 +60 +105 = 390. \n\nBut Sarah's meeting is exactly her window. \n\nAlternatively, is there a way to meet both Sarah and Karen?\n\nFor example:\n\nAfter Mary (ends 7:37 PM), go to Karen. Union Square to Chinatown (7 mins). Arrive 7:44. Meet until 9:14 (90 mins). Then go to Alamo Square (Chinatown to Alamo Square is 15 mins). Arrive 9:29. Meet Sarah until 9:45 (16 mins). Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, after Mary, go to Sarah first. Union Square to Alamo Square (15 mins). Arrive 7:52. Wait until 8 PM. Meet until 9:45. Then go to Karen. Alamo Square to Chinatown is 15 mins. Arrive 10:00, which is after Karen's 9:15 PM end time. No.\n\nSo Sarah can only be met if we schedule her exactly from 8-9:45, which requires arriving at 8 PM. \n\nSo let's consider that:\n\nSchedule Sarah from 8-9:45 PM. To get there by 8 PM, we need to arrive at Alamo Square by 8 PM. So previous location must allow travel to Alamo Square in time.\n\nFor example, if previous meeting ends at 7:45 PM, travel time to Alamo Square must be 15 mins max. \n\nLooking at the schedule, after Jessica (ends 6:30 PM), we have until 8 PM to fit in other meetings. \n\nSo from 6:30 PM to 8 PM (1.5 hours):\n\nCould meet Mary for 60 mins (6:30-7:30), then travel to Alamo Square. Union Square to Alamo Square is 15 mins. Arrive 7:45. Wait until 8 PM. Then meet Sarah 8-9:45. \n\nBut Mary's available from 4:45 PM. So schedule Mary from 6:30-7:30. Wait, Jessica ends at 6:30 PM. Then go to Union Square (Nob Hill to Union Square is 7 mins. Arrive 6:37. Meet Mary from 6:37-7:37. Then leave for Alamo Square at 7:37. Arrive 7:52. Wait until 8 PM. Meet Sarah from 8-9:45. \n\nThis way, Sarah is met. Then after Sarah, no time for others. \n\nSo friends met: Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, Sarah. 6 friends. \n\nAlternatively, after Sarah, go to Matthew. Alamo Square to Bayview is 16 mins. Arrive 10:01 PM. Too late. \n\nAlternatively, after Sarah, go to Charles. Alamo Square to The Castro is 8 mins. Arrive 9:53. Meet until 10:00 (7 mins). Not enough. \n\nSo this way, Sarah is met, but Matthew and Karen are not. \n\nAlternatively, skip Sarah and meet Matthew. \n\nSo comparing meeting 6 friends in either case. But wait, what about Charles? He's available from 4:30 PM to 10 PM. Needs 105 mins. If we can fit him in after Jessica. \n\nLet's try:\n\n- Jessica: 4:30-6:30 PM (Nob Hill)\n- Travel to The Castro: Nob Hill to The Castro is 17 mins. Arrive 6:47.\n- Meet Charles: 6:47-8:32 PM (105 mins)\n- Travel to Alamo Square: 8 mins. Arrive 8:40.\n- Meet Sarah: 8:40-9:45 (65 mins, insufficient)\n\nNo good. \n\nAlternatively, after Charles, go to Karen. The Castro to Chinatown is 22 mins. Arrive 8:54. Meet until 9:15 (21 mins, insufficient). \n\nAlternatively, after Charles, go to Matthew. The Castro to Bayview is 19 mins. Arrive 8:51. Meet until 10:51, but Matthew's available until 10 PM. So 8:51-10 PM (69 mins). Not enough. \n\nSo meeting Charles would prevent meeting Sarah or Matthew adequately. \n\nAnother angle: Let's see if we can meet Mary earlier. Mary is available from 4:45 PM. Suppose after Brian, Thomas, and Nancy, we go to Mary first, then Jessica. \n\nBut Jessica's window starts at 4:30 PM. Let's see:\n\nBrian: 12:15-1:15\nThomas: 1:25-1:55\nNancy: 2:45-3:00\nMary: 3:00-4:00 (needs 60 mins). But Mary is available from 4:45 PM. So no, can't meet her before 4:45. \n\nSo Mary must be after 4:45 PM. \n\nAlternative schedule:\n\nStart with Brian at 12:15-1:15. Then Thomas 1:25-1:55. Then Nancy 2:45-3:00. Then have time until 4:30 PM for Jessica. But Jessica's window starts at 4:30 PM. \n\nWait, between 3:00 PM and 4:30 PM (1.5 hours), we can perhaps meet someone else. But all other friends are available later. \n\nAlternatively, after Nancy at 3:00 PM, travel to Jessica's location (Nob Hill). From North Beach to Nob Hill is 7 mins. Arrive 3:07. But Jessica isn't available until 4:30. So wait until 4:30. That's 1h23m of waiting. Not efficient. \n\nAlternatively, use that time to meet someone else. But no one is available. \n\nSo the schedule seems tight. \n\nBest possible friends met seem to be Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, and either Matthew or Sarah. \n\nNow, comparing Matthew (120 mins) vs Sarah (105 mins). Since Matthew requires more time, but both are possible only if we choose one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's possible to meet both Mary and Charles. Let's see:\n\nAfter Jessica (6:30 PM), go to Charles: 6:47-8:32. Then go to Sarah: 8:40-9:45. Then no time for others. So Charles and Sarah met. \n\nBut in this case, Mary isn't met. \n\nSo total friends: Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Charles, Sarah. \n\nMary requires 60 mins, which is less than Charles' 105. So meeting Charles gives more total time met. \n\nBut the goal is to meet as many friends as possible, not necessarily maximize time. \n\nEach friend counts as one, regardless of time. So meeting 6 friends is better than 5. \n\nSo perhaps the optimal is Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, and either Matthew or Sarah. \n\nBetween Matthew and Sarah: \n\nMatthew requires 120 mins, available from 7:15 PM. Sarah requires 105 mins, available from 8 PM. \n\nIf we meet Matthew from 7:15-9:15 PM (120 mins), then can't meet Sarah. \n\nIf we meet Sarah from 8-9:45 PM (105 mins), then can't meet Matthew. \n\nBut also, after Mary (ends 7:37 PM), can we go to Matthew's location? \n\nUnion Square to Bayview is 18 mins. Arrive 7:55. Meet until 9:55. That's 120 mins. \n\nAlternatively, after Mary, go to Sarah's location: Union Square to Alamo Square is 15 mins. Arrive 7:52. Wait until 8 PM. Meet until 9:45. \n\nSo choosing between Matthew and Sarah. \n\nWhich one gives more friends met? Both add one friend. \n\nSo the count remains 6 either way. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to meet another friend. \n\nWait, Karen is available from 7:15-9:15 PM. If after Mary (7:37 PM), go to Karen. Union Square to Chinatown: 7 mins. Arrive 7:44. Meet until 9:14 (90 mins). Then go to Sarah. Chinatown to Alamo Square: 15 mins. Arrive 9:29. Meet until 9:45 (16 mins). Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, meet Karen from 7:44-9:14, then go to Matthew. Chinatown to Bayview: 19 mins. Arrive 9:33. Meet until 10:00 (27 mins). Not enough. \n\nSo Karen can't be met. \n\nSo the optimal schedule seems to be:\n\nBrian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, and either Matthew or Sarah. \n\nWhich to choose? \n\nMatthew's meeting is 120 mins, Sarah's is 105. Both are valid. \n\nBut Sarah's window exactly fits her required time (8-9:45), so we can meet her fully. Matthew's window is 7:15-10 PM, so meeting him from 7:15-9:15 is possible. \n\nBut in the scenario where after Mary (ends 7:37), go to Matthew: arrive 7:55, meet until 9:55. This uses his full 120 mins. \n\nAlternatively, meet Sarah from 8-9:45. \n\nIf we choose Matthew, we can't meet Sarah, but if we choose Sarah, we can't meet Matthew. \n\nBut the user wants to meet as many friends as possible. Both options give 6 friends. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to meet both Karen and Matthew. Let me think:\n\nAfter Mary ends at 7:37, go to Matthew (18 mins, arrive 7:55). Meet until 9:55. Then travel to Karen's location (Bayview to Chinatown: 19 mins, arrive 10:14 PM. Karen's available until 9:15 PM. Too late. \n\nNo. \n\nAlternatively, meet Karen first. From Mary's Union Square to Chinatown (7 mins, arrive 7:44. Meet until 9:14. Then to Matthew: 19 mins, arrive 9:33. Meet until 10:00 (27 mins). Not enough. \n\nSo no. \n\nThus, the maximum number of friends is 6. \n\nNow, the next step is to check which friends can be met within the time constraints, considering travel times. \n\nLet's try to make the schedule with Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, and Matthew:\n\nTimeline:\n\n9:00 AM: Arrive at Embarcadero.\n\nThen:\n\n- 12:15-1:15 PM: Brian (Marina District). Travel from Embarcadero to Marina District takes 12 mins. So leave at 12:03 PM to arrive at 12:15. But how does that fit? Wait, the user starts at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. The time from 9:00 AM to 12:15 PM is 3h15m. What's happening during this time? Maybe there's a mistake here. Because Brian is available from 12:15 PM. So the user has to wait until 12:15 PM. So the first meeting is Brian at 12:15 PM.\n\nWait, the user arrives at Embarcadero at 9:00 AM. To get to Marina District, it's 12 mins. So leave at 12:03 PM to arrive at 12:15 PM. But from 9:00 AM to 12:03 PM, there's 3 hours and 3 minutes. Are there any friends available during this time? \n\nLooking back at the friends' availability:\n\n- Stephanie: Presidio until 10:15 AM (but can't meet due to time constraints)\n- Others start in the afternoon.\n\nSo during the morning, no one is available except Stephanie, which can't be met. So the user has free time until 12:15 PM.\n\nSo the first meeting is Brian at 12:15-1:15 PM.\n\nThen, travel to Fisherman's Wharf: Marina District to Fisherman's Wharf is 10 mins. Arrive at 1:25 PM. Meet Thomas from 1:25-1:55 PM.\n\nThen, travel to North Beach: Fisherman's Wharf to North Beach is 6 mins. Arrive at 2:01 PM. Nancy is available from 2:45 PM. So wait until 2:45. Meet her from 2:45-3:00 PM.\n\nThen, travel to Nob Hill: North Beach to Nob Hill is 7 mins. Arrive at 3:07 PM. But Jessica is available from 4:30 PM. So need to wait until 4:30 PM. That's 1h23m of waiting. That's a long time. Is there a way to utilize this time?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after Nancy, go somewhere else. But no other friends are available during that time. So the user has to wait at Nob Hill from 3:07 PM until 4:30 PM. Not ideal, but necessary.\n\nThen, meet Jessica from 4:30-6:30 PM at Nob Hill.\n\nAfter Jessica, travel to Union Square: Nob Hill to Union Square is 7 mins. Arrive at 6:37 PM. Meet Mary from 6:37-7:37 PM.\n\nThen, travel to Bayview: Union Square to Bayview is 18 mins. Arrive at 7:55 PM. Meet Matthew from 7:55-9:55 PM. This meets his 120 mins requirement.\n\nThen, travel back from Bayview to somewhere else, but all other friends' availability ends by 10 PM.\n\nThis schedule includes Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, Matthew. 6 friends.\n\nAlternative schedule including Sarah instead of Matthew:\n\nAfter Mary (7:37 PM), travel to Alamo Square: Union Square to Alamo Square is 15 mins. Arrive at 7:52 PM. Wait until 8 PM. Meet Sarah from 8-9:45 PM. Then, no time for others.\n\nThis includes Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, Sarah. Also 6 friends.\n\nNow, comparing both options:\n\nOption 1 (Matthew):\n\n- Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, Matthew (6)\n- Total meeting time: 60 +30 +15 +120 +60 +120 = 405 mins\n\nOption 2 (Sarah):\n\n- Brian, Thomas, Nancy, Jessica, Mary, Sarah (6)\n- Total meeting time: 60 +30 +15 +120 +60 +105 = 390 mins\n\nBoth meet 6 friends. Option 1 has more total time. But since the goal is to meet as many friends as possible, both are equal. However, the user might prefer meeting more friends with higher time requirements. \n\nBut the problem states \"meet as many friends as possible\". Since both options meet 6 friends, perhaps there's a way to meet a seventh. Let's check.\n\nIs there a way to meet Nancy and Thomas, Brian, Jessica, Mary, and then either Matthew/Sarah, and also fit in Karen or Charles?\n\nFor example:\n\nAfter meeting Mary (7:37 PM), can we meet Karen for 90 mins (7:44-9:14 PM), then go to Sarah (9:29-9:45, 16 mins). Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, after Mary, meet Karen for 90 mins (7:44-9:14), then meet Charles from 9:14-10:00 (46 mins). Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, after Mary, meet Charles from 7:54-9:39 (105 mins), then go to Sarah, arriving at 9:47, too late.\n\nSo no. \n\nAnother possibility: During the gap between Nancy (3:00 PM) and Jessica (4:30 PM), can we meet someone else? But no friends are available during that time. \n\nWhat about meeting Nancy earlier? Nancy is available from 2:45 PM. After meeting Thomas (1:55 PM), go to North Beach, which is 6 mins from Fisherman's Wharf. Arrive at 2:01 PM. Wait until 2:45 PM to meet Nancy. That's 44 mins of waiting. \n\nAlternatively, adjust the order of meetings to minimize gaps. \n\nFor example:\n\nBrian 12:15-1:15 PM.\n\nThen, go to North Beach to meet Nancy. Marina District to North Beach: Travel time? Marina District to North Beach: 11 mins (checking the data: Marina District to North Beach is 11). So leave Marina at 1:15, arrive at 1:26 PM. But Nancy is available from 2:45 PM. So wait until 2:45 PM. Meet from 2:45-3:00 PM. Then go to Fisherman's Wharf. North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf is 5 mins. Arrive at 3:05 PM. Meet Thomas from 3:05-3:35 PM. But Thomas is available from 1:30 PM to 7:00 PM. So this is possible. \n\nThis way, the gap after Brian is filled by traveling to Nancy, waiting, meeting her, then Thomas. \n\nBut does this affect other meetings? \n\nAfter Thomas ends at 3:35 PM, then travel to Nob Hill. Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 mins. Arrive at 3:46 PM. Wait until 4:30 PM to meet Jessica. That's 44 mins of waiting. \n\nThen, Jessica from 4:30-6:30 PM.\n\nThen, Mary from 6:37-7:37 PM.\n\nThen, Matthew from 7:55-9:55 PM.\n\nThis way, all meetings are scheduled, same 6 friends, but the gap after Thomas is reduced from 1h23m to 44m. But overall, same number of friends. \n\nBut this doesn't add any new friends. \n\nAlternatively, after Thomas ends at 3:35 PM, is there time to meet someone else before Jessica? Mary is available from 4:45 PM. Can we meet Mary for 60 mins from 3:35 PM? No, she's available from 4:45 PM. \n\nSo no. \n\nThus, the maximum number of friends is 6. \n\nNow, between the two options (Matthew or Sarah), which is better? Let's check constraints:\n\n- Matthew requires 120 mins, available until 10 PM. \n- Sarah requires 105 mins, available until 9:45 PM. \n- Mary's meeting ends at 7:37 PM. \n\nIf we go with Matthew:\n\n- After Mary, travel to Bayview (18 mins), arrive 7:55 PM. Meet until 9:55 PM. \n\nIf we go with Sarah:\n\n- After Mary, travel to Alamo Square (15 mins), arrive 7:52 PM. Wait until 8 PM. Meet until 9:45 PM. \n\nBoth are valid. \n\nBut the user might want to meet friends with longer minimum times first. But the problem states to meet as many as possible. Since both options give 6 friends, they are equal. \n\nHowever, another angle: Matthew's meeting requires 120 mins, which is longer than Sarah's 105. If the user wants to prioritize those with longer required times, Matthew might be preferred. However, the problem states to meet as many as possible, not prioritize duration. \n\nTherefore, either is acceptable. \n\nBut let's check if there's a way to meet a seventh friend. For example, Nancy's meeting is only 15 mins. Maybe fit in someone else. \n\nLooking at the schedule:\n\nBrian (12:15-1:15)\n\nThomas (1:25-1:55)\n\nNancy (2:45-3:00)\n\nJessica (4:30-6:30)\n\nMary (6:37-7:37)\n\nMatthew (7:55-9:55)\n\nIs there any time to meet Charles or Karen or others? \n\nBetween 3:00 PM and 4:30 PM, there's a gap. Can we meet Charles? He's available from 4:30 PM. So from 4:30 PM, but Jessica is scheduled at 4:30 PM. \n\nAlternatively, after Nancy (3:00 PM), go to Union Square to meet Mary early. But Mary is available from 4:45 PM. \n\nNo. \n\nThus, no seventh friend. \n\nFinal decision: The schedule includes 6 friends. The JSON should reflect this. \n\nNow, to construct the JSON:\n\nItinerary:\n\n1. Meet Brian at Marina District from 12:15-13:15.\n2. Meet Thomas at Fisherman's Wharf from 13:25-13:55.\n3. Meet Nancy at North Beach from 14:45-15:00.\n4. Meet Jessica at Nob Hill from 16:30-18:30.\n5. Meet Mary at Union Square from 18:37-19:37.\n6. Meet Matthew at Bayview from 19:55-21:55.\n\nTravel times:\n\n- Embarcadero to Marina District: 12 mins (arrive 12:15).\n- Marina to Fisherman's Wharf: 10 mins (leave 13:15, arrive 13:25).\n- Fisherman's to North Beach: 6 mins (leave 13:55, arrive 14:01. Wait until 14:45.)\n- North Beach to Nob Hill: 7 mins (leave 15:00, arrive 15:07. Wait until 16:30.)\n- Nob Hill to Union Square: 7 mins (leave 18:30, arrive 18:37.)\n- Union Square to Bayview: 18 mins (leave 19:37, arrive 19:55.)\n\nThis fits all the travel times and constraints.",
