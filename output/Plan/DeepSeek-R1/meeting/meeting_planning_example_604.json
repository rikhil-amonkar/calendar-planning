            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this scheduling problem. Hmm, starting at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. The goal is to meet as many friends as possible considering their availability and the travel times between locations. Let me list out all the constraints first.\n\nFirst, William is at Embarcadero from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM. I need to meet him for 90 minutes. But I arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. Wait, that's conflicting because William's time ends at 9:00 AM. But the problem says I arrive at 9 AM. So maybe it's impossible to meet William? Because his availability ends at 9:00 AM, and I get there at 9 AM. The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero is 8 minutes. So leaving at 9:00 AM, arriving at 9:08 AM. But William is already gone by 9:00 AM. So maybe William can't be met. That's a problem. Wait, the user wants to meet William for 90 minutes. But his window is 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM. If I arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM, there's no way to meet William. So William is out. So maybe the user made a mistake here? Or maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, the user's constraints say: William will be at Embarcadero from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM. They want to meet William for 90 minutes. But since the user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM, they can't meet William. So that's a lost cause. So we can ignore William.\n\nNext, Stephanie is at Nob Hill from 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM. Need to meet her for 45 minutes. Since we start at 9 AM at Fisherman's Wharf. The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. So leaving at 9 AM, arrive at 9:11 AM. Stephanie is available until 9:30 AM. So the latest we can start is 9:30 minus 45 minutes, which is 8:45 AM. But we can't start before 9:11 AM. Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. If arrival at Nob Hill is 9:11 AM. Available until 9:30 AM. So the available time is from 9:11 to 9:30. That's 19 minutes. But the required minimum is 45 minutes. So Stephanie can't be met either. Hmm, so Stephanie's slot is also not possible. So maybe that's another person we can't meet.\n\nSo William and Stephanie are not possible. So the remaining people are Laura, Daniel, Karen, Joseph, and Kimberly.\n\nJoseph is at Alamo Square from 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM. Minimum 15 minutes. Let's see. Starting at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM. Next, let's plan the earliest possible meetings. The next available person is Joseph. Let's see. From Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square is 20 minutes. So leaving at 9 AM, arrive at 9:20 AM. But Joseph is available from 11:30 AM. So maybe need to schedule Joseph between 11:30 AM and 12:45 PM. Let's see. Let's plan to meet Joseph first. Let's say we leave Fisherman's Wharf at some time to reach Alamo Square by 11:30 AM. The travel time is 20 minutes. So leave Fisherman's Wharf at 11:10 AM, arrive at 11:30 AM. Then meet Joseph from 11:30 AM to 11:45 AM (15 minutes). Then after that, what's next?\n\nThen, Karen is at Russian Hill from 2:30 PM to 7:45 PM. Need 30 minutes. So after Joseph, travel from Alamo Square to Russian Hill. Let's check the travel time. Alamo Square to Russian Hill is 13 minutes. So leave Alamo Square at 11:45, arrive at Russian Hill at 11:58. But Karen's availability starts at 2:30 PM. So there's a gap here. Maybe after Joseph, we can do something else. Let's see.\n\nKimberly is at North Beach from 3:45 PM to 7:15 PM. Need 30 minutes. Russian Hill to North Beach is 4 minutes (from Russian Hill to North Beach). But if we go to Karen first, but Karen is available from 2:30 PM. Let me think. Alternatively, after Joseph, maybe go to Kimberly. Let's see. From Alamo Square to North Beach is 16 minutes. So leave at 11:45 AM, arrive at 12:01 PM. But Kimberly's availability starts at 3:45 PM. So that's too early. So maybe after Joseph, we have time to go somewhere else. Let's check other options.\n\nAlternatively, after Joseph, go to Russian Hill (Karen's place) but she's available from 2:30 PM. So maybe after Joseph, there's time to go to another location. Wait, maybe after Joseph, we can go to Karen's location early but she's not available. So maybe the next step is to fill the time between 11:45 AM to 2:30 PM. Let's see. That's a lot of time. Maybe we can meet someone else here. But the available people are Laura (The Castro, 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM), Daniel (Golden Gate Park, 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM), Karen (Russian Hill, 2:30 PM onwards), Kimberly (North Beach, 3:45 PM onwards). So between 11:45 AM and 2:30 PM, maybe there's no one available. So perhaps that's free time. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rearrange the order. Let's think.\n\nStart at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. Can we meet someone else first? Like Kimberly in North Beach. Wait, she's available from 3:45 PM. So that's later. Karen is available from 2:30 PM. So maybe the order should be Joseph (11:30-12:45 PM), then Karen (2:30 PM), then Kimberly (3:45 PM), then Laura (7:45 PM), then Daniel (9:15 PM). Let's see.\n\nFirst, Joseph: Alamo Square, 11:30 AM. So need to leave Fisherman's Wharf at 11:10 AM to arrive by 11:30 AM. So from 9 AM to 11:10 AM, we can do something else. Wait, that's two hours and ten minutes. But there's no one available during that time. Because William and Stephanie are in the morning, but their slots are already over by 9 AM. So maybe during this time, we can't meet anyone. So the first meeting is Joseph at 11:30 AM.\n\nAfter Joseph, we have from 11:45 AM to 2:30 PM (when Karen is available). That's 2 hours and 45 minutes. So perhaps we can go to Russian Hill (Karen's place) but she's not available until 2:30 PM. So maybe wait there? Not ideal. Alternatively, use that time for travel, but maybe there's no one else to meet. So maybe the next step is to go to Karen's location, Russian Hill, but arrive at 2:30 PM.\n\nSo from Alamo Square to Russian Hill is 13 minutes. If we leave Alamo Square at 2:17 PM, arrive at 2:30 PM. But we finish Joseph at 11:45 AM. So there's a gap from 11:45 AM to 2:17 PM. That's 2 hours and 32 minutes. Maybe that's unavoidable. So meet Karen at 2:30 PM for 30 minutes (until 3:00 PM). Then, after that, Kimberly is available at North Beach from 3:45 PM. So from 3:00 PM to 3:45 PM, there's 45 minutes. Travel from Russian Hill to North Beach is 4 minutes. So we can leave at 3:41 PM to arrive at 3:45 PM. Then meet Kimberly from 3:45 PM to 4:15 PM (30 minutes). Then, after that, Laura is at The Castro from 7:45 PM. So need to get there. From North Beach to The Castro takes 22 minutes. So leave North Beach at 7:23 PM, arrive at The Castro at 7:45 PM. Then meet Laura for 105 minutes, which is 1 hour and 45 minutes. So from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM. Then Daniel is at Golden Gate Park from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. Need 15 minutes. The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. So leave The Castro at 9:30 PM, arrive at 9:41 PM. But Daniel's time ends at 9:45 PM. So meet from 9:41 PM to 9:45 PM. That's only 4 minutes. Not enough. So that's a problem. So maybe we need to adjust.\n\nWait, Laura's meeting is from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM (105 minutes). Then after that, to Daniel at Golden Gate Park. The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 13 minutes (from The Castro to Golden Gate Park). Wait, looking at the travel times: The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. So leaving The Castro at 9:30 PM (end of Laura's meeting), arrive at 9:41 PM. But Daniel's time is until 9:45 PM. So 9:41 PM to 9:45 PM is 4 minutes. Not enough for 15. So maybe that's not possible. So maybe need to leave Laura's meeting earlier to meet Daniel. Let's see. If we leave Laura at 9:15 PM (since Daniel starts at 9:15 PM). Let's see. The required time with Laura is 105 minutes. So from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM is 1 hour 45 minutes (105 minutes). So if we leave Laura at 9:30 PM, but Daniel starts at 9:15 PM. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we need to leave Laura earlier. For example, start Laura's meeting at 7:45 PM and leave at 9:15 PM (that's 90 minutes), then travel to Daniel's location. 7:45 PM to 9:15 PM is 90 minutes, but we need 105. So that's not enough. So maybe Daniel can't be met either. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe meet Laura from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM (105 minutes), then go to Daniel. But Daniel's time is 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. If we arrive at 9:30 PM (after leaving Laura at 9:30 PM), but the travel time from The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. So arrive at 9:41 PM. Then meet Daniel from 9:41 PM to 9:45 PM. Only 4 minutes. Not enough. So Daniel can't be met unless we leave Laura earlier. But Laura's required minimum is 105 minutes. So maybe Daniel isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe adjust the schedule to include Daniel earlier. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe after Kimberly at North Beach (4:15 PM), there's time before Laura. Let's see. From 4:15 PM to 7:45 PM (when Laura is available). That's 3.5 hours. Maybe there's another person to meet. But according to the constraints, the only ones left are Laura and Daniel. So perhaps no. So during that time, nothing. So the schedule would be:\n\n- Joseph: 11:30 AM to 11:45 AM\n- Karen: 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM\n- Kimberly: 3:45 PM to 4:15 PM\n- Laura: 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM\n\nThat's four people. But Daniel isn't possible. So maybe that's the maximum.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Are there any other possibilities?\n\nAnother approach: After Karen at Russian Hill (ends 3:00 PM), maybe go to Golden Gate Park to see if there's time. But Daniel is only available from 9:15 PM. So not helpful. Alternatively, after Kimberly (ends 4:15 PM), maybe go to another location. But there's no one else available except Laura and Daniel later. So perhaps the maximum is four people: Joseph, Karen, Kimberly, Laura.\n\nBut let's check if there's a way to fit Daniel. For example, if after Kimberly's meeting at 4:15 PM, we can go to Golden Gate Park. But Daniel is there from 9:15 PM. So the time between 4:15 PM and 7:45 PM (Laura's time) is 3.5 hours. Maybe that's too early. Alternatively, after meeting Laura, perhaps leave early to meet Daniel. But Laura's meeting needs 105 minutes. So from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM. If we leave Laura at 9:15 PM (90 minutes), then travel to Golden Gate Park. The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes. Arrive at 9:26 PM. Daniel's time is until 9:45 PM. So meet from 9:26 PM to 9:45 PM: 19 minutes. That's over the 15-minute requirement. So that's possible. But we'd have to shorten Laura's meeting by 15 minutes. But the constraint says Laura requires a minimum of 105 minutes. So if we meet Laura from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM, that's exactly 105 minutes. So we can't leave early. So Daniel can't be met unless we somehow meet him after Laura. But as previously, the time is too tight. So maybe Daniel can't be included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different order of meetings. Let's think: Starting at 9 AM, perhaps first meet Karen. But Karen is available from 2:30 PM. So that's later. Let's try another order.\n\nAfter Joseph, maybe go to Kimberly first. But Kimberly is available from 3:45 PM. So after Joseph at 11:45 AM, the next available is Karen at 2:30 PM. So the order is Joseph -> Karen -> Kimberly -> Laura. That's four people.\n\nAlternatively, if after Joseph, can we go somewhere else? Let's see. For example, after Joseph at Alamo Square, maybe go to The Castro (Laura) but she's available only from 7:45 PM. So that's too early. So no. So the initial plan seems the best.\n\nWait, maybe after Joseph, go to Golden Gate Park, but Daniel is not there until 9:15 PM. So no. Alternatively, check other locations. For example, from Alamo Square to Russian Hill (13 minutes) but Karen isn't available until 2:30 PM. So maybe we can't do anything until 2:30 PM.\n\nSo the schedule would be:\n\n9:00 AM - Arrive at Fisherman's Wharf.\n\n11:10 AM - Leave for Alamo Square (20 minutes travel).\n\n11:30 AM - Meet Joseph until 11:45 AM.\n\n11:45 AM - Leave Alamo Square.\n\nNext, need to plan to meet Karen at Russian Hill at 2:30 PM. The travel time from Alamo Square to Russian Hill is 13 minutes. So leave Alamo Square at 2:17 PM, arrive at 2:30 PM. Meet Karen until 3:00 PM.\n\nThen, from Russian Hill to North Beach (Kimberly) is 4 minutes. Leave at 3:41 PM, arrive at 3:45 PM. Meet Kimberly until 4:15 PM.\n\nThen, from North Beach to The Castro. Travel time is 22 minutes. Leave North Beach at 7:23 PM, arrive at 7:45 PM. Meet Laura until 9:30 PM.\n\nThen, travel to Golden Gate Park (The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 minutes), arrive at 9:41 PM. Daniel's available until 9:45 PM. So only 4 minutes, which is not enough. So Daniel can't be met.\n\nSo the itinerary includes Joseph, Karen, Kimberly, Laura. Four people.\n\nWait, but what about Stephanie? Her availability is from 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM. But the user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM. Travel time to Nob Hill is 11 minutes. So arriving at 9:11 AM. Stephanie's available until 9:30 AM. So possible meeting time from 9:11 AM to 9:30 AM. That's 19 minutes. But the requirement is 45 minutes. So Stephanie can't be met. Similarly, William's time is over.\n\nSo the maximum possible is four people: Joseph, Karen, Kimberly, Laura. Let's check the times again.\n\nJoseph: 11:30 AM to 11:45 AM (15 mins, meets the minimum).\n\nKaren: 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM (30 mins, meets minimum).\n\nKimberly: 3:45 PM to 4:15 PM (30 mins).\n\nLaura: 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM (105 mins).\n\nThat works. Now check travel times between each:\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf to Alamo Square (20 mins) \u2013 leave 9:00 AM, arrive 9:20 AM. But Joseph's available from 11:30 AM. Wait, no. Wait, the first action is to meet Joseph. Wait, the user arrives at Fisherman's Wharf at 9 AM. To meet Joseph at Alamo Square starting at 11:30 AM, need to leave Fisherman's Wharf at 11:10 AM (20 mins travel). So the first meeting is at 11:30 AM. So the user stays at Fisherman's Wharf from 9 AM to 11:10 AM. Then travels to Alamo Square.\n\nSo the itinerary:\n\n1. Meet Joseph: Alamo Square, 11:30-11:45.\n\nThen, Alamo Square to Russian Hill: 13 mins. So leave at 11:45, arrive at 12:00 PM (noon). But Karen isn't available until 2:30 PM. So that's a long wait. Alternatively, maybe schedule Karen at 2:30 PM. Wait, so the travel from Alamo Square to Russian Hill takes 13 mins, so leaving Alamo Square at 2:17 PM to arrive at Russian Hill at 2:30 PM. So between 11:45 AM and 2:17 PM, what's happening? That's 2 hours and 32 minutes. The user can't meet anyone during that time. So perhaps the itinerary would have a gap here, but since there's no one available, it's unavoidable.\n\nThen, after Karen at 3:00 PM, the user goes to North Beach. Travel time from Russian Hill to North Beach is 4 mins. So leave at 3:41 PM, arrive at 3:45 PM. Meet Kimberly until 4:15 PM.\n\nThen, from North Beach to The Castro. Travel time is 22 mins. So leave at 7:23 PM, arrive at 7:45 PM. Meet Laura until 9:30 PM.\n\nDaniel is not possible.\n\nSo the JSON should include these four meetings.",
