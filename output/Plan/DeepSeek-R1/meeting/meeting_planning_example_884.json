            "raw_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to schedule meetings with as many friends as possible in San Francisco, considering travel times and constraints. The user starts in Richmond District at 9:00 AM. The goal is to fit all the required meetings with the minimum time each person needs. Let me break down each person's availability and the required meeting durations.\n\nFirst, list all the friends and their constraints:\n\n- Robert: Chinatown, 7:45 AM to 5:30 PM, needs 120 minutes.\n- David: Sunset District, 12:30 PM to 7:45 PM, 45 minutes.\n- Matthew: Alamo Square, 8:45 AM to 1:45 PM, 90 minutes.\n- Jessica: Financial District, 9:30 AM to 6:45 PM, 45 minutes.\n- Melissa: North Beach, 7:15 AM to 4:45 PM, 45 minutes.\n- Mark: Embarcadero, 3:15 PM to 5:00 PM, 45 minutes.\n- Deborah: Presidio, 7:00 PM to 7:45 PM, 45 minutes.\n- Karen: Golden Gate Park, 7:30 PM to 10:00 PM, 120 minutes.\n- Laura: Bayview, 9:15 PM to 10:15 PM, 15 minutes.\n\nWait, but Laura's time is 9:15 PM to 10:15 PM. But Karen is at Golden Gate Park until 10 PM. Also, Deborah is at Presidio from 7 PM. So maybe Laura's meeting is possible after Karen, but the user needs to check travel time from Golden Gate Park to Bayview. Let's check the travel times. Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 22 minutes. If Karen's meeting ends at 9:30 PM (since she's available till 10 PM), then leaving Golden Gate Park at 9:30 PM, arriving Bayview at 9:52 PM. But Laura's available from 9:15 PM to 10:15 PM. So 15 minutes could fit from 9:52 to 10:07 PM. But Laura's minimum is 15 minutes, which is possible. But maybe that's pushing it, but maybe possible.\n\nBut first, let's start with the earliest meetings. The user is in Richmond District at 9:00 AM. Let's look at the earliest available meetings. Matthew is at Alamo Square until 1:45 PM, needs 90 minutes. The user needs to meet him first perhaps. Let's check the travel time from Richmond District to Alamo Square: 13 minutes. So leaving Richmond at 9:00, arriving at Alamo Square at 9:13 AM. Matthew is available from 8:45 AM. So the earliest possible start time is 9:13 AM. The meeting needs to be 90 minutes, so ending at 10:43 AM. That's okay. Then after that, where to next?\n\nAfter Matthew, next could be Robert in Chinatown, who needs 120 minutes. From Alamo Square to Chinatown is 15 minutes. So leaving at 10:43 AM, arriving at 10:58 AM. Robert is available until 5:30 PM. So starting at 10:58 AM, meet until 12:58 PM. That's 120 minutes. Then next, perhaps David in Sunset District, who is available from 12:30 PM. From Chinatown to Sunset District is 29 minutes. Leaving at 12:58 PM, arriving at 1:27 PM. David's available until 7:45 PM. Needs 45 minutes. So meet from 1:27 PM to 2:12 PM. Then next, maybe Jessica in Financial District. From Sunset District to Financial District is 30 minutes. Leaving at 2:12 PM, arriving at 2:42 PM. Jessica is available until 6:45 PM. Meet for 45 minutes until 3:27 PM. Then maybe Melissa in North Beach. Financial District to North Beach is 7 minutes (from Financial District to North Beach: 7). Leaving at 3:27 PM, arriving at 3:34 PM. Melissa's available until 4:45 PM. Meet until 4:19 PM (45 minutes). Then, Mark in Embarcadero from 3:15 PM to 5 PM. Financial District to Embarcadero is 4 minutes (since they're adjacent?). Wait, Financial District to Embarcadero travel time is 4 minutes. So after meeting Melissa, but wait, the order might need adjustment. Let's think again.\n\nWait, after Jessica in Financial District (ends at 3:27 PM), then perhaps go to Mark at Embarcadero. Financial District to Embarcadero is 4 minutes. So leave at 3:27 PM, arrive at 3:31 PM. Mark's available until 5 PM. Meet from 3:31 PM to 4:16 PM (45 minutes). Then, after that, maybe Melissa in North Beach. From Embarcadero to North Beach is 5 minutes (travel time). So leave at 4:16 PM, arrive at 4:21 PM. Melissa's available until 4:45 PM. So meet from 4:21 PM to 4:45 PM (24 minutes), but she needs 45 minutes. That's not enough. So this approach isn't working. Alternatively, after Jessica, maybe go to Melissa first, then Mark.\n\nWait, after Jessica ends at 3:27 PM, go to North Beach (Financial District to North Beach is 7 minutes). Arrive at 3:34 PM. Meet Melissa from 3:34 PM to 4:19 PM (45 minutes). Then, go to Mark in Embarcadero. North Beach to Embarcadero is 6 minutes. Arrive at 4:25 PM. Mark is available until 5 PM. Meet from 4:25 PM to 5:10 PM, but Mark's window ends at 5 PM. So can only meet until 5 PM. That's 35 minutes, which is less than the required 45. So that's a problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: After Jessica in Financial District ends at 3:27 PM, go to Mark first. Financial District to Embarcadero is 4 minutes. Arrive at 3:31 PM. Meet until 4:16 PM. Then from Embarcadero to North Beach is 5 minutes. Arrive at 4:21 PM. Melissa is available until 4:45 PM. So meet from 4:21 PM to 4:45 PM (24 minutes), which is not enough. So this doesn't work. So maybe Melissa's meeting has to be scheduled earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps after Matthew (ends 10:43 AM), the next could be Robert (ends 12:58 PM), then maybe Melissa. From Chinatown to North Beach is 3 minutes. So after Robert ends at 12:58 PM, go to North Beach (3 minutes), arrive at 1:01 PM. Melissa is available until 4:45 PM. Meet from 1:01 PM to 1:46 PM (45 minutes). Then, go to David in Sunset District. North Beach to Sunset District is 28 minutes. Arrive at 2:14 PM. David is available from 12:30 PM. Meet from 2:14 PM to 2:59 PM. Then, go to Jessica in Financial District. Sunset District to Financial District is 30 minutes. Arrive at 3:29 PM. Meet until 4:14 PM. Then, go to Mark in Embarcadero (Financial District to Embarcadero is 4 minutes, arrive 4:18 PM). Mark's window is 3:15 PM to 5 PM. Meet from 4:18 PM to 5:03 PM, but Mark's window ends at 5 PM. So ends at 5 PM, which is 42 minutes. Close but not 45. Hmm. Not enough. Alternatively, adjust the order.\n\nAlternatively, after David in Sunset District (ends 2:59 PM), go to Golden Gate Park? But Karen is there in the evening. Maybe not. Let's stick to the current order.\n\nWait, perhaps after David, go to Golden Gate Park? But Karen is there from 7:30 PM. Maybe not. Let's focus on the current constraints.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting David, go to Jessica in Financial District. From Sunset to Financial District is 30 minutes. Arrive at 2:59 +30 = 3:29 PM. Meet Jessica until 4:14 PM. Then go to Mark in Embarcadero (4 minutes). Arrive 4:18 PM, meet until 5:03 PM, but Mark's window ends at 5 PM. So 42 minutes. Not enough. So perhaps Jessica's meeting is shorter? No, she needs 45. So maybe we need to adjust.\n\nAlternative idea: Meet Mark first, then Jessica. After David ends at 2:59 PM, go to Mark. Sunset District to Embarcadero is 30 minutes. Arrive at 3:29 PM. Mark's available from 3:15 PM. Meet from 3:29 PM to 4:14 PM. Then, Embarcadero to Financial District is 5 minutes (since Embarcadero to Financial District is 5). Arrive 4:19 PM. Jessica is available until 6:45 PM. Meet from 4:19 PM to 5:04 PM. That's okay. Then, after that, maybe go to Melissa in North Beach. Financial District to North Beach is 7 minutes. Arrive 5:11 PM. But Melissa's available until 4:45 PM. So too late. So Melissa can't be met after 4:45 PM. So Melissa's meeting has to be scheduled earlier.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try a different approach. Let's list all the friends and their time windows, and see which ones have the tightest constraints.\n\nMatthew: must be met before 1:45 PM and needs 90 minutes. So latest start time is 12:15 PM (since 12:15 +1.5h =1:45 PM). So Matthew has to be scheduled first.\n\nRobert needs 2 hours, available until 5:30 PM. So possible to meet him after Matthew.\n\nDavid is available from 12:30 PM, needs 45 minutes.\n\nJessica until 6:45 PM.\n\nMelissa until 4:45 PM.\n\nMark until 5 PM.\n\nDeborah at 7 PM.\n\nKaren from 7:30 PM.\n\nLaura from 9:15 PM.\n\nSo the tightest time constraints are Matthew (must end by 1:45 PM), Mark (ends at 5 PM), Melissa (ends at 4:45 PM), Deborah (starts at 7 PM), Karen (starts at 7:30 PM), and Laura (starts at 9:15 PM).\n\nSo starting with Matthew. The user arrives at Richmond District at 9:00 AM. Travel to Alamo Square takes 13 minutes. Arrive at 9:13 AM. Meet Matthew from 9:13 AM to 10:43 AM (90 minutes). Then, next possible meetings.\n\nFrom Alamo Square, the next could be Robert in Chinatown (15 minutes away). Arrive at 10:58 AM. Meet from 10:58 AM to 12:58 PM (120 minutes). Then, after that, go to David in Sunset District. Chinatown to Sunset District is 29 minutes. Arrive at 1:27 PM. Meet David until 2:12 PM (45 minutes). Then, from Sunset District, maybe go to Golden Gate Park? Wait, no, Karen is there in the evening. Alternatively, go to Jessica in Financial District. Sunset to Financial District is 30 minutes. Arrive at 2:42 PM. Meet until 3:27 PM. Then, Jessica's done. Then, go to Melissa in North Beach. Financial District to North Beach is 7 minutes. Arrive at 3:34 PM. Meet until 4:19 PM (45 minutes). Then, go to Mark in Embarcadero. North Beach to Embarcadero is 6 minutes. Arrive at 4:25 PM. Mark's available until 5 PM. Meet from 4:25 PM to 5:10 PM, but Mark's window ends at 5 PM. So only 35 minutes. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternative: After Jessica, go to Mark first. Financial District to Embarcadero is 4 minutes. Arrive at 3:27 PM +4 = 3:31 PM. Meet Mark from 3:31 PM to 4:16 PM. Then, go to Melissa. Embarcadero to North Beach is 5 minutes. Arrive at 4:21 PM. Melissa's available until 4:45 PM. Meet from 4:21 PM to 4:45 PM (24 minutes). Not enough. So can't do that.\n\nAlternative idea: After meeting David in Sunset District (ends 2:12 PM), maybe go to Golden Gate Park for Karen later, but she's only available from 7:30 PM. So maybe not yet. Alternatively, after David, go to Presidio for Deborah? But Deborah is at 7 PM. No. Maybe after Mark, go to Deborah, then Karen, then Laura.\n\nWait, after Mark, the next would be Deborah at Presidio from 7 PM. Let's see. Suppose after Mark's meeting ends at 5 PM (if possible), then travel to Presidio. Embarcadero to Presidio is 20 minutes. So leave at 5 PM, arrive at 5:20 PM. But Deborah is available from 7 PM. So there's a gap. Maybe during that gap, meet Karen? Karen is at Golden Gate Park from 7:30 PM. So from Presidio to Golden Gate Park: 12 minutes. Wait, Presidio to Golden Gate Park is 12 minutes. If we go to Golden Gate Park after Deborah, but Deborah's meeting is from 7 PM to 7:45 PM. Then Karen is from 7:30 PM. So maybe meet Deborah from 7:00 PM to 7:45 PM (45 minutes). Then go to Golden Gate Park (12 minutes), arrive at 7:57 PM. Karen's available until 10 PM. Meet from 7:57 PM to 9:57 PM (120 minutes). Then, go to Bayview. Golden Gate Park to Bayview is 22 minutes. Arrive at 10:19 PM. Laura is available until 10:15 PM. So that's too late. So Laura can't be met. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the order. Maybe meet Karen first, then Deborah. Karen at Golden Gate Park from 7:30 PM. If meet her from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM. Then travel to Presidio (Golden Gate Park to Presidio is 11 minutes). Arrive at 9:41 PM. But Deborah is available until 7:45 PM. So that's impossible. So Deborah has to be met at 7 PM. So after Mark, go to Presidio. Let's say after Mark's meeting ends at 5 PM, but Deborah isn't available until 7 PM. So there's a two-hour gap. Maybe meet Jessica or others during that time? But Jessica is available until 6:45 PM. Wait, maybe after Mark, go back to Jessica. But Mark is in Embarcadero. From there to Financial District is 5 minutes. Jessica is there until 6:45 PM. Could meet again, but she only needs 45 minutes. Not necessary. Alternatively, use that time to travel to Presidio early and wait? Not efficient.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me try to outline a possible schedule step by step.\n\nStart at Richmond District at 9:00 AM.\n\n1. Meet Matthew in Alamo Square: 9:13 AM - 10:43 AM (90 mins)\n   - Travel time: 13 mins (9:00-9:13)\n\n2. Meet Robert in Chinatown: 10:58 AM - 12:58 PM (120 mins)\n   - Travel from Alamo Square to Chinatown: 15 mins (10:43-10:58)\n\n3. Meet David in Sunset District: 1:27 PM - 2:12 PM (45 mins)\n   - Travel from Chinatown to Sunset: 29 mins (12:58-1:27)\n\n4. Meet Jessica in Financial District: 2:42 PM - 3:27 PM (45 mins)\n   - Travel from Sunset to Financial: 30 mins (2:12-2:42)\n\n5. Meet Mark in Embarcadero: 3:31 PM - 4:16 PM (45 mins)\n   - Travel from Financial to Embarcadero:4 mins (3:27-3:31)\n\n6. Meet Melissa in North Beach: 4:22 PM - 4:45 PM (23 mins) \u2192 Not enough time. Problem here.\n\nSo Melissa needs 45 mins but can only get 23. So this approach fails.\n\nAlternative: After Jessica, go to Melissa first, then Mark.\n\nAfter Jessica ends at 3:27 PM:\n\n4. Jessica ends at 3:27 PM.\n\n5. Travel to North Beach (Financial to North Beach:7 mins \u2192 3:27-3:34 PM)\n\n   Meet Melissa from 3:34 PM to 4:19 PM (45 mins)\n\n6. Then, go to Mark in Embarcadero: North Beach to Embarcadero:6 mins \u2192 4:19-4:25 PM\n\n   Mark is available until 5 PM. Meet from 4:25 PM to 5:10 PM (but Mark's window ends at 5 PM \u2192 35 mins). Not enough.\n\nAlternative: Swap Mark and Melissa.\n\nAfter Jessica:\n\n4. Meet Mark first: Financial to Embarcadero (4 mins \u2192 3:27-3:31 PM). Meet from 3:31 to 4:16 PM (45 mins).\n\n5. Then go to Melissa: Embarcadero to North Beach (5 mins \u2192 4:16-4:21 PM). Meet from 4:21 to 4:45 PM (24 mins). Not enough.\n\nThus, Melissa can't be fit in this schedule. So perhaps we have to drop Melissa to fit others.\n\nBut the goal is to meet as many friends as possible. So if Melissa can't be fit, we proceed without her.\n\nSo proceeding with the initial plan:\n\n1. Matthew: 9:13-10:43\n2. Robert: 10:58-12:58\n3. David: 1:27-2:12\n4. Jessica: 2:42-3:27\n5. Mark: 3:31-4:16\n6. Then, travel to Presidio for Deborah at 7 PM. From Embarcadero to Presidio is 20 mins. So leave at 4:16 PM, arrive at 4:36 PM. But Deborah isn't available until 7 PM. So there's a gap. Maybe go somewhere else? But no other friends are available during that time.\n\nAlternatively, after Mark, perhaps meet Karen. But Karen is available from 7:30 PM. So after Mark, the next is Deborah at 7 PM. But there's a 2.5-hour gap. Maybe go to Golden Gate Park early, but Karen isn't there until 7:30 PM. So perhaps impossible.\n\nAlternatively, after Mark, go to Golden Gate Park and wait until 7:30 PM. Travel time from Embarcadero to Golden Gate Park: 25 mins. So leave at 4:16 PM, arrive at 4:41 PM. Then wait until 7:30 PM to meet Karen for 120 mins until 9:30 PM. Then go to Laura in Bayview: 22 mins travel, arrive at 9:52 PM, meet until 10:07 PM (15 mins). But Laura is available until 10:15 PM. That works.\n\nBut Deborah at Presidio from 7 PM to 7:45 PM. If we're meeting Karen from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM, we can't meet Deborah. So we have to choose between Deborah and Karen/Laura.\n\nAlternatively, after Mark, go to Deborah first. But she's available from 7 PM. So after Mark ends at 4:16 PM, there's a gap until 7 PM. Travel from Embarcadero to Presidio is 20 mins. So leave at 4:16 PM, arrive 4:36 PM. Wait until 7 PM. Then meet Deborah from 7:00 PM to 7:45 PM. Then go to Golden Gate Park (12 mins) arrive 7:57 PM. Meet Karen from 7:57 PM to 9:57 PM. Then go to Bayview (22 mins) arrive 10:19 PM, but Laura is available until 10:15 PM. So can't meet Laura. So Laura is out.\n\nAlternatively, skip Deborah and go to Karen and Laura.\n\nSo choices:\n\nOption 1: Deborah and Laura can't be both met if Karen is included. If we prioritize Karen and Laura:\n\nAfter Mark (ends 4:16 PM), wait until 7:30 PM to meet Karen (but that's a long wait). Or fill the time with something else. But no other friends are available. Alternatively, adjust the schedule to meet Karen earlier? No, she's only available from 7:30 PM.\n\nAlternatively, after Mark, go to Presidio to meet Deborah from 7 PM. Then Karen from 7:57 PM to 9:57 PM. Laura is available until 10:15 PM. But arriving at 10:19 PM is too late.\n\nAnother option: Meet Karen from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM, then go to Laura. Travel time 22 mins, arrive 9:52 PM. Meet until 10:07 PM. Laura's available until 10:15 PM. That works.\n\nBut in this case, Deborah can't be met. So the total meetings would be Matthew, Robert, David, Jessica, Mark, Karen, Laura. That's 7 meetings. But Deborah is another meeting. If possible to fit her in, that's better.\n\nAlternative plan: After Mark ends at 4:16 PM, go to Golden Gate Park (25 mins, arrive 4:41 PM). Wait until 7:30 PM to meet Karen (wasting time). Then meet Karen from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM. Then go to Laura. But that's possible. But during the wait time, maybe meet Deborah. But Deborah is at Presidio from 7 PM. So after waiting at Golden Gate Park until 7 PM, travel to Presidio (12 mins from Golden Gate Park to Presidio). Arrive at 7:12 PM. Meet Deborah from 7:12 PM to 7:57 PM (45 mins). Then travel back to Golden Gate Park (11 mins) arrive 8:08 PM. Then meet Karen from 8:08 PM to 10:08 PM, but Karen's available until 10 PM. So ends at 10:00 PM. Then go to Laura in Bayview (22 mins, arrive 10:22 PM, too late). So this doesn't work.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a schedule that includes as many as possible.\n\nPrioritize meetings with longer required times first. Robert (120), Matthew (90), Karen (120), and others have shorter times.\n\nSo the optimal schedule would include Matthew, Robert, David, Jessica, Mark, Karen, and Laura. But can we fit them all?\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Matthew: 9:13-10:43\n2. Robert: 10:58-12:58\n3. David: 1:27-2:12\n4. Jessica: 2:42-3:27\n5. Mark: 3:31-4:16\n6. Travel to Golden Gate Park: from Embarcadero to Golden Gate Park is 25 mins. So leave at 4:16, arrive 4:41 PM. Wait until 7:30 PM (waste time), meet Karen 7:30-9:30 PM.\n7. Then to Bayview: 22 mins, arrive 9:52 PM. Meet Laura 9:52-10:07 PM (15 mins).\n\nThis way, Deborah is skipped, but seven meetings are scheduled. But is there a way to include Deborah?\n\nAlternative: After Mark, go to Presidio (Embarcadero to Presidio is 20 mins \u2192 4:16-4:36 PM). Wait until 7 PM, meet Deborah 7:00-7:45 PM. Then to Golden Gate Park (12 mins \u2192 7:45-7:57 PM). Meet Karen from 7:57-9:57 PM. Then to Bayview (22 mins \u2192 10:19 PM), too late for Laura. So Laura can't be met. So this gives six meetings (Matthew, Robert, David, Jessica, Mark, Deborah, Karen). But Karen's meeting ends at 9:57 PM, and Laura is available until 10:15 PM. If Karen's meeting is shortened by 15 minutes (ends at 9:42 PM), then travel to Bayview arrives at 10:04 PM, meet Laura until 10:15 PM. But Karen's minimum is 120 minutes. So can't shorten. So it's impossible.\n\nThus, the maximum number of meetings would be seven if we include Laura, but skip Deborah. Or six if including Deborah and Karen, but skipping Laura. But Laura's meeting is only 15 minutes, which might be easier to fit.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user wants to meet as many friends as possible. So which option allows more meetings?\n\nOption 1:\n\nMatthew, Robert, David, Jessica, Mark, Karen, Laura \u2192 7 meetings.\n\nOption 2:\n\nMatthew, Robert, David, Jessica, Mark, Deborah, Karen \u2192 7 meetings, but Laura is skipped.\n\nBut Laura's window is until 10:15 PM, and if Karen's meeting ends at 9:30 PM, travel to Bayview takes 22 mins, arrive at 9:52 PM. Meet Laura until 10:07 PM. That works. So option 1 allows seven meetings.\n\nBut in this case, Deborah is skipped. So total seven meetings.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to fit Deborah in?\n\nAfter meeting Karen until 9:30 PM, travel to Presidio. Golden Gate Park to Presidio is 11 mins. Arrive 9:41 PM. Deborah is available until 7:45 PM. So no, she's already left.\n\nThus, the best schedule is seven meetings: Matthew, Robert, David, Jessica, Mark, Karen, Laura.\n\nNow, check the travel times and overlaps.\n\nLet me outline the itinerary again:\n\n1. Meet Matthew: 9:13-10:43 AM (Alamo Square)\n2. Travel to Chinatown:15 mins \u2192 arrive 10:58 AM\n3. Meet Robert:10:58 AM-12:58 PM\n4. Travel to Sunset District:29 mins \u2192 arrive 1:27 PM\n5. Meet David:1:27-2:12 PM\n6. Travel to Financial District:30 mins \u2192 arrive 2:42 PM\n7. Meet Jessica:2:42-3:27 PM\n8. Travel to Embarcadero:4 mins \u2192 arrive 3:31 PM\n9. Meet Mark:3:31-4:16 PM\n10. Travel to Golden Gate Park:25 mins \u2192 arrive 4:41 PM. Wait until 7:30 PM.\n11. Meet Karen:7:30-9:30 PM\n12. Travel to Bayview:22 mins \u2192 arrive 9:52 PM\n13. Meet Laura:9:52-10:07 PM\n\nThis works. All meetings meet the minimum time requirements except Melissa, Deborah, but includes seven friends. However, Melissa's meeting couldn't be fit in. But the problem states to meet as many as possible. So this schedule meets seven friends.\n\nAnother check: Between Mark's meeting ends at 4:16 PM and Karen's starts at 7:30 PM, there's a gap. Can we fit Melissa during that time? Let's see.\n\nAfter Mark ends at 4:16 PM, go to North Beach. Embarcadero to North Beach is 5 mins. Arrive 4:21 PM. Melissa's available until 4:45 PM. Meet from 4:21-4:45 PM (24 mins). Not enough. So can't.\n\nThus, the maximum possible is seven friends: Matthew, Robert, David, Jessica, Mark, Karen, Laura.\n\nNow, let's verify all travel times and overlaps.\n\nAnother possible optimization: After meeting Mark, go to Golden Gate Park earlier and wait, but that's already considered.\n\nIs there any way to fit in Melissa by adjusting the order?\n\nFor example, after meeting Jessica in Financial District (ends 3:27 PM), instead of going to Mark, go to Melissa first. Financial District to North Beach is 7 mins \u2192 arrive 3:34 PM. Meet until 4:19 PM (45 mins). Then go to Mark: North Beach to Embarcadero is 6 mins \u2192 arrive 4:25 PM. Mark's available until 5 PM. Meet until 5:10 PM, but Mark's window ends at 5 PM. So meet until 5 PM (35 mins). Not enough. So Mark can't be met. So if we prioritize Melissa over Mark, we lose Mark. But Mark's meeting requires 45 mins. So it's better to include Mark and skip Melissa, since Mark's window is tighter (ends at 5 PM), while Melissa's ends at 4:45 PM. So including Mark gives us one more meeting.\n\nThus, the current plan is optimal.\n\nFinal itinerary:\n\n1. Matthew: 9:13-10:43\n2. Robert:10:58-12:58\n3. David:1:27-2:12\n4. Jessica:2:42-3:27\n5. Mark:3:31-4:16\n6. Karen:7:30-9:30\n7. Laura:9:52-10:07\n\nTravel times between each step are accounted for. Check:\n\nFrom Mark (Embarcadero) to Golden Gate Park: 25 mins. Leave 4:16 PM, arrive 4:41 PM. Wait until 7:30 PM. Then meet Karen until 9:30 PM. Then to Bayview:22 mins, arrive 9:52 PM. Meet Laura until 10:07 PM. All constraints are met.\n\nThus, this schedule fits seven friends.",
