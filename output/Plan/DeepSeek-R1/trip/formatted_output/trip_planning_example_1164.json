            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit 8 European cities in 17 days using only direct flights. The cities are Reykjavik, Stockholm, Porto, Nice, Venice, Vienna, Split, and Copenhagen. Each has specific day requirements and some events tied to certain days. Let me break down the constraints first.\n\nFirst, Reykjavik is 2 days with a friend between days 3-4. Then Stockholm for 2 days, friends between days 4-5. Porto needs 5 days, including a wedding from day 13-17. Nice is 3 days, Venice 4, Vienna 3 (workshop days 11-13), Split 3, and Copenhagen 2. The total days add up to 2+2+5+3+4+3+3+2 = 24, but the trip is only 17 days. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, no\u2014maybe overlapping days when flying? Because when you fly on day X, you count as being in both cities. So the total days must sum to 17. Let me check:\n\nWait, the user says that if you fly from A to B on day X, you are in both cities on day X. So each flight day counts towards both cities. So the sum of all days in each city should be 17. Let's verify the required days:\n\nReykjavik: 2 days (must include days 3-4)\nStockholm: 2 days (must include days 4-5)\nPorto: 5 days (days 13-17)\nNice: 3 days\nVenice: 4 days\nVienna: 3 days (days 11-13)\nSplit: 3 days\nCopenhagen: 2 days\n\nTotal required days: 2+2+5+3+4+3+3+2 = 24. But the trip is 17 days. So overlapping via flight days is necessary. Therefore, we need to arrange the itinerary so that on travel days, the days are counted for both departure and arrival cities. That means each flight reduces the total days by 1. Since 24 required days minus 17 actual days = 7 overlapping days, so there need to be 7 flights (since each flight causes one day overlap). But the user is visiting 8 cities, so they need 7 flights (since starting in the first city, then 7 flights to get to the others). So that works out.\n\nNow, arranging the order. Let's list the events:\n\n- Reykjavik: 2 days, including days 3-4. So days could be 3-4 (but need to arrive there by day 3, and maybe leave on day 4 or 5? Wait, the friend meeting is between day 3 and 4. So maybe days 3 and 4 in Reykjavik? Then the 2 days there are days 3 and 4. Then the flight out would be day 4 or 5. Wait, but the user has to be in Stockholm between day 4-5. So after Reykjavik, go to Stockholm. Let's think.\n\nPossible start:\n\nDay 1-2: Some city. Let's see. But the first city could be Reykjavik. But the friend meeting is days 3-4. So maybe days 3-4 in Reykjavik. So days 1-2 elsewhere. Wait, but the user needs to be in Reykjavik for 2 days, which must include days 3 and 4. So days 3 and 4 are in Reykjavik, but maybe they arrive on day 3 (so day 3 is counted in Reykjavik and the previous city). Wait, no. If they fly into Reykjavik on day 3, then day 3 counts in both the previous city and Reykjavik. So maybe they arrive on day 3. For example, if they are in City A on day 2, fly to Reykjavik on day 3, which counts as day 3 in both City A and Reykjavik. But the user needs to spend 2 days in Reykjavik. So days 3 and 4 would be in Reykjavik. So day 3 is arrival (shared with previous city's day 3), day 4 is full day. Then leave on day 5? But they need to meet friends in Stockholm between days 4-5. So maybe after Reykjavik, go to Stockholm. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: Let's list all the events in chronological order:\n\n- Days 3-4: Reykjavik (meet friend)\n- Days 4-5: Stockholm (meet friends)\n- Days 11-13: Vienna (workshop)\n- Days 13-17: Porto (wedding)\n\nPorto is the last part, days 13-17, which is 5 days. Since the wedding is between days 13-17, Porto must be days 13-17. But wait, the user wants to stay in Porto for 5 days, which would be days 13-17 inclusive (5 days: 13,14,15,16,17). That's correct.\n\nVienna's workshop is days 11-13. So Vienna must be days 11,12,13. But wait, 3 days. But 11-13 is three days. But if they are in Vienna on day 11, 12, 13, then the workshop is covered. But they also need to get to Porto by day 13. Wait, but Porto starts on day 13. So the flight from Vienna to Porto would be on day 13, which counts as day 13 in both Vienna and Porto. So Vienna days 11-13 (3 days: 11,12,13), Porto days 13-17 (13,14,15,16,17). That works because day 13 is shared.\n\nNow, the other cities: Split (3 days), Copenhagen (2 days), Venice (4 days), Nice (3 days).\n\nLet's try to build the itinerary step by step.\n\nStart with Reykjavik. They need to be there days 3-4. So days 3 and 4. To get there, the previous city would have to be a city with a direct flight to Reykjavik. From the list, direct flights to Reykjavik are: Nice, Vienna, Copenhagen, Stockholm.\n\nLooking at the events after Reykjavik: Stockholm needs to be days 4-5. So after Reykjavik, go to Stockholm. Because days 4-5 in Stockholm. So flight from Reykjavik to Stockholm on day 4. Then day 4 is counted in both Reykjavik and Stockholm. So Reykjavik days: 3 (arrival) and 4 (departure). Wait, no: if you fly from Reykjavik to Stockholm on day 4, then day 4 is counted in both. So Reykjavik would be days 3 and 4. Then Stockholm is days 4 and 5 (since day 4 is arrival, day 5 is full day). That meets the requirement of meeting friends in Stockholm between day 4-5.\n\nSo:\n\nReykjavik: Day 3-4 (2 days)\n\nStockholm: Day 4-5 (2 days)\n\nBut wait, how does that work? If you fly from Reykjavik to Stockholm on day 4, then day 4 is in both cities. So Reykjavik's days are 3 and 4 (2 days). Stockholm's days are 4 and 5 (2 days). Then leave Stockholm on day 5 or 6.\n\nBut after Stockholm, where to go? Next, the user needs to visit Split (3 days), Venice (4), Vienna (3, days 11-13), Nice (3), Copenhagen (2), and Porto (5 days). Also, the user has to fit in all these cities with direct flights.\n\nWait, but the workshop in Vienna is days 11-13. So Vienna must be days 11-13. Let's see.\n\nSo after Stockholm (days 4-5), next possible destinations. From Stockholm, direct flights are to: Nice, Copenhagen, Split, Vienna. Let's check possible next cities.\n\nLooking ahead, Vienna is needed on days 11-13, which is later. So maybe after Stockholm, go to Copenhagen? Because Stockholm has a direct flight to Copenhagen. Copenhagen needs 2 days. If after Stockholm (days 4-5), fly to Copenhagen on day 5. Then Copenhagen would have days 5 and 6 (since day 5 is arrival). That's 2 days. Then leave Copenhagen on day 6 or 7.\n\nFrom Copenhagen, direct flights to Vienna, Venice, Split, Porto, Nice, Reykjavik, Stockholm. Next, Split needs 3 days. If from Copenhagen to Split, but Split requires 3 days. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, after Copenhagen, go to Split. So Split days 6-8 (3 days). Then from Split, possible direct flights to Copenhagen, Stockholm, Vienna. From Split, next could be Vienna. Vienna is needed later, but workshop is days 11-13. So maybe Split days 6-8, then fly to Vienna on day 8. But Vienna needs days 11-13. That leaves a gap between day 8 and 11. So maybe not. Alternatively, after Copenhagen, go to Venice. Venice needs 4 days. Let's see.\n\nWait, let's think of the timeline:\n\nDays 1-2: ?\n\nDays 3-4: Reykjavik\n\nDays 4-5: Stockholm\n\nDays 5-6: Copenhagen\n\nDays 6-9: Split (3 days: 6-8?)\n\nWait, no. If days 6-8 in Split would be 3 days, but then days 9-? For Venice, Nice, Vienna, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Copenhagen, go to Venice. Venice requires 4 days. If Copenhagen is days 5-6 (2 days), fly to Venice on day 6. Then Venice would be days 6-9 (4 days: 6,7,8,9). Then from Venice, direct flights to Vienna, Nice, Copenhagen. Then Vienna is needed days 11-13. So after Venice, maybe go to Vienna. But Vienna's workshop is days 11-13, so arriving on day 11. So days 11-13 in Vienna. How to get there from Venice.\n\nVenice days 6-9, then next city. Let's say from Venice to Nice. Nice needs 3 days. Direct flight exists (Venice to Nice? Wait, the direct flights list includes Nice and Venice. Yes, \"Nice and Venice\". So Venice can fly to Nice. So after Venice (days 6-9), fly to Nice on day 9. Then Nice days 9-11 (3 days: 9,10,11). Then fly to Vienna on day 11. Vienna days 11-13 (11,12,13). Then fly to Porto on day 13. Porto days 13-17.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n- Reykjavik: 3-4 (2 days)\n- Stockholm:4-5 (2)\n- Copenhagen:5-6 (2)\n- Venice:6-9 (4)\n- Nice:9-11 (3)\n- Vienna:11-13 (3)\n- Porto:13-17 (5)\n\nThat's 7 cities. Wait, Split is missing. Split needs 3 days. Oh right, so where to fit Split. Hmm.\n\nSo maybe after Copenhagen, instead of going to Venice, go to Split. So:\n\nCopenhagen:5-6 (2 days)\n\nSplit:6-8 (3 days: 6,7,8). Wait, day 6 is arrival from Copenhagen. So Split days 6-8 (3 days: 6,7,8). Then fly to Venice on day 8. Venice needs 4 days: 8-11 (days 8,9,10,11). Then fly to Nice on day 11. But Vienna is needed days 11-13. So conflict here.\n\nAlternatively, after Split, go to Vienna. Split days 6-8, fly to Vienna on day 8. Then Vienna days 8-10. But the workshop is days 11-13. So can't be. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative route: Maybe after Venice, go to Split. But Split needs 3 days, and then after that, proceed to Vienna.\n\nBut let's try again.\n\nStart:\n\n1-2: Nice? Because Nice has many direct flights.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't specified any constraints for Nice except 3 days. Let's see. If the first two days are in Nice. Then fly to Reykjavik on day 3. Because there's a direct flight from Nice to Reykjavik. So:\n\nNice: days 1-2 (2 days?), but user wants 3 days. Wait, user wants 3 days in Nice. So maybe Nice days 1-3. Then fly to Reykjavik on day 3. So Reykjavik days 3-4. Then Stockholm days 4-5. Then Copenhagen days5-6. Then Split days6-8. Then Venice days8-11. Then Vienna days11-13. Then Porto days13-17.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n- Nice: days1-3 (3 days). Fly to Reykjavik on day3. So day3 counts in both Nice and Reykjavik.\n\n- Reykjavik: day3 (from flight) and day4. So days3-4 (2 days).\n\n- Fly to Stockholm on day4. Stockholm days4-5.\n\n- Fly to Copenhagen on day5. Days5-6.\n\n- Fly to Split on day6. Split days6-8 (3 days).\n\n- Fly to Venice on day8. Venice days8-11 (4 days).\n\n- Fly to Vienna on day11. Vienna days11-13 (3 days).\n\n- Fly to Porto on day13. Porto days13-17 (5 days).\n\nThis covers all cities except... wait, the cities are Reykjavik, Stockholm, Porto, Nice, Venice, Vienna, Split, Copenhagen. That's 8 cities. Yes. Let's check the days:\n\nNice: 1-3 (3 days)\n\nReykjavik:3-4 (2)\n\nStockholm:4-5 (2)\n\nCopenhagen:5-6 (2)\n\nSplit:6-8 (3)\n\nVenice:8-11 (4)\n\nVienna:11-13 (3)\n\nPorto:13-17 (5)\n\nTotal days: 3+2+2+2+3+4+3+5 = 24, but since flights are overlapping, the actual days are 17. Let's count day by day:\n\nDay 1: Nice\n\nDay 2: Nice\n\nDay3: Nice (fly to Reykjavik) \u2192 counts as Nice day3 and Reykjavik day3\n\nDay4: Reykjavik (fly to Stockholm) \u2192 Reykjavik day4, Stockholm day4\n\nDay5: Stockholm (fly to Copenhagen) \u2192 Stockholm day5, Copenhagen day5\n\nDay6: Copenhagen (fly to Split) \u2192 Copenhagen day6, Split day6\n\nDay7: Split\n\nDay8: Split (fly to Venice) \u2192 Split day8, Venice day8\n\nDay9: Venice\n\nDay10: Venice\n\nDay11: Venice (fly to Vienna) \u2192 Venice day11, Vienna day11\n\nDay12: Vienna\n\nDay13: Vienna (fly to Porto) \u2192 Vienna day13, Porto day13\n\nDay14: Porto\n\nDay15: Porto\n\nDay16: Porto\n\nDay17: Porto\n\nThat's 17 days total. Now check all city days:\n\nNice: days1-3 \u2192 3 days (1,2,3)\n\nReykjavik: days3-4 \u2192 2 days (3,4)\n\nStockholm: days4-5 \u2192 2 days (4,5)\n\nCopenhagen: days5-6 \u2192 2 days (5,6)\n\nSplit: days6-8 \u2192 3 days (6,7,8)\n\nVenice: days8-11 \u2192 4 days (8,9,10,11)\n\nVienna: days11-13 \u2192 3 days (11,12,13)\n\nPorto: days13-17 \u21925 days (13,14,15,16,17)\n\nYes, all required days are met. Also, the events:\n\n- Reykjavik: days3-4 (friend meeting)\n\n- Stockholm: days4-5 (friends)\n\n- Vienna workshop: days11-13\n\n- Porto wedding: days13-17\n\nCheck direct flights between the cities in the itinerary:\n\n1. Nice to Reykjavik: Yes (listed under Nice and Reykjavik)\n\n2. Reykjavik to Stockholm: Yes (Reykjavik and Stockholm)\n\n3. Stockholm to Copenhagen: Yes (Stockholm and Copenhagen)\n\n4. Copenhagen to Split: Yes (Copenhagen and Split)\n\n5. Split to Venice: Split to Venice? Wait, the direct flights list includes \"Split and Vienna\", \"Split and Copenhagen\", \"Stockholm and Split\", \"Split and Vienna\". Wait, Split's direct flights are Copenhagen, Stockholm, Vienna. Split to Venice is not listed. So Split to Venice is not possible. Oops, that's a problem. So this route is invalid because after Split, there's no direct flight to Venice.\n\nSo the previous itinerary is invalid. Need to adjust.\n\nAlternative after Split: fly to Vienna, but workshop is later.\n\nSplit days6-8. From Split, direct flights to Copenhagen, Stockholm, Vienna. So from Split to Vienna. So:\n\nSplit days6-8, fly to Vienna on day8. Vienna days8-10. But the workshop is days11-13. So this doesn't work. So need to adjust.\n\nAlternative route after Copenhagen:\n\nCopenhagen days5-6. Then fly to Venice? Direct flight from Copenhagen to Venice? Yes, listed under Copenhagen and Venice.\n\nSo:\n\nCopenhagen days5-6. Fly to Venice on day6. Venice days6-9 (4 days:6,7,8,9). Then fly to Split from Venice? But Split's direct flights don't include Venice. So can't go directly. Alternatively, fly to Vienna. Venice to Vienna is direct (Venice and Vienna). Then Vienna days9-11 (3 days). But workshop is days11-13, so can't. Alternatively, from Venice to Nice. Venice to Nice is direct. Then Nice days9-11 (3 days). Then fly to Vienna on day11. Vienna days11-13. Then Porto.\n\nBut Split is missing. Split needs 3 days. So where to fit Split?\n\nAlternative idea: After Venice, go to Split via Vienna? But Split needs to be after Venice. But maybe:\n\nVenice days6-9, fly to Vienna day9. Vienna days9-11 (but workshop is 11-13). Then from Vienna to Split. But Vienna to Split is a direct flight. So:\n\nVienna days9-11. Fly to Split on day11. Split days11-13. But workshop is in Vienna on days11-13. Conflict. So that's no good.\n\nAlternatively, after Vienna's workshop (days11-13), fly to Split? But Split needs 3 days. But the total days are 17, and after day13, we have Porto from 13-17. So no time.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try another approach.\n\nLet's see the direct flights again. Maybe the key is to connect Split and Vienna, as they have a direct flight. Since Vienna is needed for days11-13, perhaps Split comes before Vienna.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nDays1-3: Nice\n\nFly to Reykjavik day3.\n\nDays3-4: Reykjavik\n\nFly to Stockholm day4.\n\nDays4-5: Stockholm\n\nFly to Copenhagen day5.\n\nDays5-6: Copenhagen\n\nFly to Split day6.\n\nDays6-8: Split\n\nFly to Vienna day8.\n\nDays8-10: Vienna\n\nBut workshop is days11-13. So need to adjust Vienna to days11-13. Not possible here.\n\nAlternative: After Split, go to Vienna on day8. Vienna days8-10. Then go to Venice. From Vienna to Venice is direct. Venice days10-13 (4 days), but workshop is in Vienna on days11-13. Conflict.\n\nAlternatively, after Vienna (days8-10), fly to Venice day10. Venice days10-13 (4 days). Then fly to Vienna day13 for the workshop? No, that's overlapping.\n\nWait, maybe the workshop in Vienna must be days11-13. So Vienna needs to be days11-13. So perhaps:\n\nAfter Split (days6-8), fly to Vienna on day8. Then Vienna days8-10. But workshop is days11-13. So no. Not possible.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe rearrange the order of cities to fit Split in after Vienna's workshop. But after Vienna is Porto, which is days13-17. So no time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Split is after Porto? But Porto is days13-17. So Split would be after day17, but the total trip is 17 days. So no.\n\nHmm. Let's see if there's another way. Maybe after Stockholm, go to Split instead of Copenhagen.\n\nReykjavik days3-4, fly to Stockholm day4. Stockholm days4-5. Then fly to Split day5. Split days5-7. Then fly to Copenhagen day7. Copenhagen days7-8. Then proceed.\n\nBut then:\n\nStockholm to Split: direct flight exists (Stockholm and Split).\n\nSplit days5-7 (3 days). Fly to Copenhagen day7. Copenhagen days7-8 (2 days). Then fly to Venice day8. Venice days8-11 (4 days). Then fly to Vienna day11. Vienna days11-13. Then Porto days13-17.\n\nThen Nice? Nice needs 3 days. When?\n\nThis approach skips Nice. Because in this route, the cities are Reykjavik, Stockholm, Split, Copenhagen, Venice, Vienna, Porto. Missing Nice. So Nice needs to be included.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAfter Venice, go to Nice. Venice days8-11. Fly to Nice day11. Nice days11-13. But Vienna workshop is days11-13. Conflict. So no.\n\nAlternatively, after Copenhagen days7-8, fly to Nice. Nice days8-10 (3 days). Then fly to Vienna day10. Vienna days10-12. But workshop is days11-13. So days10-12 in Vienna would include days11-12, but missing day13. Then fly to Porto on day13. But workshop is up to day13. So Vienna needs to be days11-13. So not possible.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's try to start with a different initial city.\n\nAlternative start:\n\nDays1-2: Copenhagen (2 days)\n\nFly to Reykjavik day3. Reykjavik days3-4.\n\nThen Stockholm days4-5.\n\nFly to Stockholm day4. Then proceed.\n\nBut from Copenhagen to Reykjavik is a direct flight (listed). So:\n\nCopenhagen days1-2.\n\nFly to Reykjavik day3. Days3-4.\n\nFly to Stockholm day4. Days4-5.\n\nThen fly to Nice day5. Nice days5-7 (3 days). Fly to Venice day7. Venice days7-10. Fly to Vienna day10. Vienna days10-12. But workshop is days11-13. So days10-12 would include day11 and 12. Then fly to Porto day13. Porto days13-17. But Split is missing.\n\nAlternatively, after Vienna, fly to Split. But no time.\n\nAlternatively, after Venice, fly to Split. Days10-12: Split. Then fly to Vienna day12. Vienna days12-14. But workshop is days11-13. So days12-14 would include days12 and13. But then Porto starts day13. So flight from Vienna to Porto on day13.\n\nSo:\n\nVienna days12-14: days12,13 (since flight to Porto on day13). So workshop days11-13. But this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let's look for another approach, perhaps using the direct flight from Nice to Porto, as Porto is the last city. Since the user is in Porto days13-17, and there's a direct flight from Nice to Porto. So maybe Nice is before Porto.\n\nWait, but the user needs to be in Vienna days11-13. So after Vienna, fly to Porto on day13. Vienna to Porto is a direct flight (listed). So that works.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nItinerary:\n\nNice: days1-3 (3 days)\n\nFly to Reykjavik day3.\n\nReykjavik: days3-4\n\nFly to Stockholm day4.\n\nStockholm: days4-5\n\nFly to Copenhagen day5.\n\nCopenhagen: days5-6\n\nFly to Split day6.\n\nSplit: days6-8\n\nFly to Venice day8.\n\nVenice: days8-11\n\nFly to Vienna day11.\n\nVienna: days11-13\n\nFly to Porto day13.\n\nPorto: days13-17\n\nNow check direct flights:\n\n- Nice to Reykjavik: Yes.\n\n- Reykjavik to Stockholm: Yes.\n\n- Stockholm to Copenhagen: Yes.\n\n- Copenhagen to Split: Yes.\n\n- Split to Venice: No. Split's direct flights are Copenhagen, Stockholm, Vienna. So Split to Venice is not possible. So this route is invalid.\n\nAh, problem here. So after Split, need to fly to a city that connects to Venice. Split can fly to Vienna. So:\n\nSplit days6-8. Fly to Vienna day8. Vienna days8-10. Then fly to Venice day10. Venice days10-13 (4 days). But Vienna workshop is days11-13. Conflict. So can't be.\n\nAlternative after Split: fly to Vienna day8. Vienna days8-10. Then fly to Venice day10. Venice days10-13. But workshop days11-13 need to be in Vienna. So this won't work.\n\nAlternative route after Split: fly to Copenhagen day8. But already did Copenhagen.\n\nAnother idea: After Split, fly to Vienna day8. Vienna days8-10. Then fly to Venice day10. But Venice needs 4 days. Days10-13. Then fly to Vienna day13. But workshop is days11-13. This would have Vienna days8-10 and 13, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, after Split (days6-8), fly to Vienna day8. Then Vienna days8-10. Then fly to Nice day10. Nice days10-12. Then fly to Venice day12. Venice days12-15. But that exceeds total days.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to find a different order.\n\nAnother approach: Start in Split.\n\nBut user has events in Reykjavik and Stockholm early on.\n\nAlternative route:\n\nDays1-3: Nice\n\nFly to Reykjavik day3.\n\nReykjavik days3-4.\n\nFly to Stockholm day4.\n\nStockholm days4-5.\n\nFly to Copenhagen day5.\n\nCopenhagen days5-6.\n\nFly to Venice day6.\n\nVenice days6-9.\n\nFly to Vienna day9.\n\nVienna days9-11.\n\nFly to Split day11.\n\nSplit days11-13.\n\nFly to Porto day13.\n\nPorto days13-17.\n\nCheck direct flights:\n\nNice to Reykjavik: yes.\n\nReykjavik to Stockholm: yes.\n\nStockholm to Copenhagen: yes.\n\nCopenhagen to Venice: yes.\n\nVenice to Vienna: yes.\n\nVienna to Split: yes.\n\nSplit to Porto: No. Split's direct flights are Copenhagen, Stockholm, Vienna. So Split to Porto is not possible. So can't fly directly. Need to go from Split to another city with a flight to Porto. The cities with flights to Porto are Nice, Vienna, Copenhagen, Venice (from the list: Nice and Porto, Copenhagen and Porto, Vienna and Porto, Venice is not listed. Wait, direct flights to Porto are:\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNice and Porto,\n\nCopenhagen and Porto,\n\nVienna and Porto.\n\nYes. So after Split, need to fly to Vienna, Copenhagen, or Nice to reach Porto.\n\nBut in this itinerary, after Split (days11-13), fly to Vienna on day13. Then Vienna to Porto on day13. But Vienna days9-11. So day13 would be flight from Split to Vienna (arrive day13), then fly to Porto same day. So Vienna day13 counts as arrival and departure. But the workshop in Vienna is days11-13. So days11-13 in Vienna. But in this case, Vienna is days9-11, which is before the workshop. Not valid.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAlternative idea: Include Vienna in the middle with the workshop.\n\nMaybe:\n\nNice days1-3.\n\nReykjavik days3-4.\n\nStockholm days4-5.\n\nCopenhagen days5-6.\n\nSplit days6-8.\n\nVenice days8-11.\n\nVienna days11-13.\n\nPorto days13-17.\n\nCheck flights:\n\nSplit to Venice: No. So after Split (days6-8), need to fly to a city that connects to Venice. Split can fly to Vienna. So:\n\nSplit days6-8.\n\nFly to Vienna day8.\n\nVienna days8-10.\n\nBut workshop is days11-13. Conflict.\n\nAlternatively, after Split, fly to Venice via Vienna? Split to Vienna to Venice. But that would require two flights, but user only takes direct flights.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThis is really tricky. Perhaps the key is to find an order where Split is connected via direct flights.\n\nAnother possible route:\n\nDays1-3: Nice\n\nFly to Reykjavik day3.\n\nDays3-4: Reykjavik\n\nFly to Stockholm day4.\n\nDays4-5: Stockholm\n\nFly to Split day5. (Stockholm and Split have direct flight)\n\nSplit days5-7.\n\nFly to Copenhagen day7. (Split and Copenhagen direct flight)\n\nCopenhagen days7-8.\n\nFly to Venice day8.\n\nVenice days8-11.\n\nFly to Vienna day11.\n\nVienna days11-13.\n\nFly to Porto day13.\n\nPorto days13-17.\n\nCheck direct flights:\n\n- Stockholm to Split: Yes.\n\n- Split to Copenhagen: Yes.\n\n- Copenhagen to Venice: Yes.\n\n- Venice to Vienna: Yes.\n\n- Vienna to Porto: Yes.\n\nThis works. Now check the days:\n\n- Nice: days1-3 (3)\n\n- Reykjavik:3-4 (2)\n\n- Stockholm:4-5 (2)\n\n- Split:5-7 (3)\n\n- Copenhagen:7-8 (2)\n\n- Venice:8-11 (4)\n\n- Vienna:11-13 (3)\n\n- Porto:13-17 (5)\n\nNow check if each city's required days are met:\n\nReykjavik: 2 days (3-4) \u2705, meets friend days3-4.\n\nStockholm: 2 days (4-5) \u2705, friends days4-5.\n\nPorto:5 days (13-17) \u2705, wedding days13-17.\n\nNice:3 days (1-3) \u2705.\n\nVenice:4 days (8-11) \u2705.\n\nVienna:3 days (11-13) \u2705, workshop days11-13.\n\nSplit:3 days (5-7) \u2705.\n\nCopenhagen:2 days (7-8) \u2705.\n\nYes, all requirements met. Now check if the direct flights are all valid:\n\n- Nice to Reykjavik: Yes.\n\n- Reykjavik to Stockholm: Yes.\n\n- Stockholm to Split: Yes.\n\n- Split to Copenhagen: Yes.\n\n- Copenhagen to Venice: Yes.\n\n- Venice to Vienna: Yes.\n\n- Vienna to Porto: Yes.\n\nAll direct flights exist.
