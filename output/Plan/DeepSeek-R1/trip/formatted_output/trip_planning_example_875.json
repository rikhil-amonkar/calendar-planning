            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a 20-day trip visiting 7 European cities with specific constraints and direct flight routes. First, I need to list out all the requirements and then figure out the order of the cities that fit the direct flight connections.\n\nThe cities to visit are Stuttgart, Edinburgh, Athens, Split, Krakow, Venice, and Mykonos. The days required in each are:\n- Stuttgart: 3 days (with workshop on days 11-13)\n- Edinburgh: 4 days\n- Athens: 4 days\n- Split: 2 days (meet friends between days 13-14)\n- Krakow: 4 days (meet friend days 8-11)\n- Venice: 5 days\n- Mykonos: 4 days\n\nTotal days should add up to 3+4+4+2+4+5+4 = 26, but the trip is only 20 days. Wait, that's a problem. The user must have made a mistake here. Wait, no, perhaps some days overlap because travel days count for both cities. For example, flying from A to B on day X counts as a day in both cities. So the total days might add up correctly if some days are shared between cities. Let me check again.\n\nThe user wants 3 days in Stuttgart, but the workshop is days 11-13. That's 3 days (11,12,13). Then Split needs 2 days with friends between days 13-14. So Split could start on day 13, overlapping with Stuttgart's last day. Similarly, Krakow has to be days 8-11. So Krakow ends on day 11, overlapping with Stuttgart starting on day 11.\n\nSo the key is to arrange the cities in an order where the transitions happen on days where the departure and arrival cities both count that day.\n\nNow, direct flights available between:\n- Krakow and Split\n- Split and Athens\n- Edinburgh and Krakow\n- Venice and Stuttgart\n- Krakow and Stuttgart\n- Edinburgh and Stuttgart\n- Stuttgart and Athens\n- Venice and Edinburgh\n- Athens and Mykonos\n- Venice and Athens\n- Stuttgart and Split\n- Edinburgh and Athens\n\nWe need to connect these cities via these direct flights.\n\nLet's start by placing the fixed dates first. The workshop in Stuttgart is days 11-13. So Stuttgart must be on days 11,12,13. But the user also needs to stay in Stuttgart for 3 days total. So maybe days 11-13, which are 3 days.\n\nThen, Split needs to have days 13-14. So the transition from Stuttgart to Split would be on day 13. That works because there's a direct flight between Stuttgart and Split.\n\nKrakow has to have days 8-11. So Krakow would be days 8-11 (4 days: 8,9,10,11). But the user needs to meet a friend there between days 8-11. Then, the next city after Krakow would be Stuttgart, which starts on day 11. So flight from Krakow to Stuttgart on day 11. That's possible because there's a direct flight between them.\n\nNow, let's outline the possible order:\n\nStart with Edinburgh (4 days). Let's see. Suppose days 1-4 in Edinburgh. Then from Edinburgh, possible direct flights are to Krakow, Stuttgart, Athens, or Venice. But Krakow is next needed from day 8. So maybe Edinburgh first, then Venice? Because Venice needs 5 days. Let's see:\n\nWait, Venice has to connect via direct flights. From Edinburgh, can fly to Venice (yes, via Venice and Edinburgh). So Edinburgh days 1-4. Then Venice days 5-9 (5 days). Then from Venice, fly to Stuttgart (direct flight exists). But Stuttgart's workshop is days 11-13. Wait, days 5-9 in Venice would end on day 9. Then maybe go to Krakow from Venice? But there's no direct flight between Venice and Krakow. Wait, the direct flights from Venice are to Stuttgart, Edinburgh, Athens. So after Venice, possible cities are Stuttgart, Edinburgh, or Athens. But Edinburgh is already done. So next could be Athens or Stuttgart.\n\nWait, but Krakow needs to be days 8-11. If we have Venice from days 5-9, then day 9 is the last day in Venice. Then, on day 9, fly to Krakow. But there's no direct flight from Venice to Krakow. The available flights from Venice are to Stuttgart, Edinburgh, Athens. So that's a problem. So maybe the initial order is different.\n\nAlternatively, start with Venice. Let's say days 1-5 in Venice. Then from Venice, fly to Edinburgh (direct flight exists). Edinburgh days 6-9 (4 days). Then from Edinburgh, fly to Krakow (direct flight exists). Krakow days 10-13. But the workshop in Stuttgart is days 11-13, which conflicts. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Let's fix the mandatory dates first.\n\nWorkshop in Stuttgart: days 11-13. So days 11,12,13 in Stuttgart. But the user needs to spend 3 days there, which is covered.\n\nKrakow: meet friend days 8-11. So Krakow must include days 8,9,10,11. But day 11 is also the start of Stuttgart. So flight from Krakow to Stuttgart on day 11. Possible because there's a direct flight.\n\nSo Krakow is days 8-11. Then Stuttgart days 11-13. Then Split days 13-14. So Split is days 13-14 (2 days). Then Split to Athens (direct flight) for 4 days. Then Athens to Mykonos (direct) for 4 days. But that would take:\n\nDays 8-11: Krakow (4 days)\n\nDays 11-13: Stuttgart (3 days)\n\nDays 13-14: Split (2 days)\n\nDays 14-17: Athens (4 days)\n\nDays 17-21: Mykonos (4 days). Wait, but the total trip is 20 days. So Mykonos can't go beyond day 20. So days 17-20 would be 4 days (days 17,18,19,20). So that works.\n\nNow, before Krakow (days 8-11), we need to fit Edinburgh (4 days), Venice (5 days), and possibly others. Wait, but the user also wants to visit Edinburgh (4 days), Venice (5 days), Mykonos (4 days), Athens (4 days), Split (2 days), Stuttgart (3 days), Krakow (4 days). Total days would be 4+5+4+4+2+3+4=26. But since overlapping days count for two cities, the actual total days should sum to 20. So need to arrange the cities so that the overlaps reduce the total to 20.\n\nLet's see. The current plan from Krakow onwards is:\n\nDays 8-11: Krakow (4 days)\n\nDays 11-13: Stuttgart (3 days)\n\nDays 13-14: Split (2 days)\n\nDays 14-17: Athens (4 days)\n\nDays 17-20: Mykonos (4 days)\n\nThat's 20 days. So days 1-7 need to be covered with Edinburgh and Venice.\n\nEdinburgh needs 4 days, Venice 5 days. Total 9 days, but days 1-7 are only 7 days. So overlapping is needed here.\n\nWait, but maybe Edinburgh and Venice can be arranged before day 8.\n\nLet's try:\n\nDays 1-5: Venice (5 days). Then fly to Edinburgh (direct flight exists). Days 5-8: Edinburgh (4 days). But day 5 is departure from Venice and arrival in Edinburgh, so day 5 counts for both. So Venice days 1-5 (days 1,2,3,4,5). Edinburgh days 5-8 (days 5,6,7,8). Then on day 8, fly to Krakow. But Edinburgh to Krakow has a direct flight. So days 8-11 in Krakow. That works.\n\nSo the full itinerary would be:\n\n1-5: Venice\n\n5-8: Edinburgh\n\n8-11: Krakow\n\n11-13: Stuttgart\n\n13-14: Split\n\n14-17: Athens\n\n17-20: Mykonos\n\nCheck the days:\n\nVenice: 5 days (1-5)\n\nEdinburgh: 4 days (5-8: days 5,6,7,8)\n\nKrakow: 4 days (8-11: days 8,9,10,11)\n\nStuttgart: 3 days (11-13: days 11,12,13)\n\nSplit: 2 days (13-14: days 13,14)\n\nAthens: 4 days (14-17: days14,15,16,17)\n\nMykonos: 4 days (17-20: days17,18,19,20)\n\nTotal days: 20. Each city's required days are met. Now check the direct flights between each transition:\n\nVenice to Edinburgh: yes (Venice and Edinburgh)\n\nEdinburgh to Krakow: yes (Edinburgh and Krakow)\n\nKrakow to Stuttgart: yes (Krakow and Stuttgart)\n\nStuttgart to Split: yes (Stuttgart and Split)\n\nSplit to Athens: yes (Split and Athens)\n\nAthens to Mykonos: yes (Athens and Mykonos)\n\nYes, all transitions have direct flights.\n\nNow check all the constraints:\n\n- Stuttgart workshop days 11-13: covered.\n\n- Split friends days 13-14: covered.\n\n- Krakow friend days 8-11: covered.\n\n- All cities are visited for the required days.\n\nYes, this seems to work. The JSON should reflect the day ranges as per the transitions.",
