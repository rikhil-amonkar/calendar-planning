            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit three European cities: Vilnius, Munich, and Mykonos, over 12 days. The requirements are 4 days in Vilnius, 3 days in Munich, and 7 days in Mykonos. But they can only take direct flights between cities. The available direct flights are Munich-Mykonos and Vilnius-Munich.\n\nFirst, let's list the direct flight connections. Vilnius can fly to Munich, and Munich can fly to Mykonos. There's no direct flight from Vilnius to Mykonos, so they have to go through Munich. Also, the user mentioned that if you fly from city A to B on day X, you're considered to be in both cities on that day. So each flight day counts as a day in both cities.\n\nTotal days needed: 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 days. But the trip is only 12 days. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe overlapping days when flying can reduce the total. Let me calculate again. For example, when flying from Vilnius to Munich on day 4, that day counts towards both cities. So Vilnius gets 4 days (Days 1-4), Munich starts on Day 4. Then Munich would have 3 days: Days 4-6 (since Day 4 is arrival, Days 5 and 6 would be full days, totaling 3 days). Then fly to Mykonos on Day 7, which would be Day 7 counted in both Munich and Mykonos. But Mykonos needs 7 days. So Days 7-13 would be 7 days (Day 7 to 13 inclusive is 7 days). Then total days would be 4 (Vilnius) + 3 (Munich) +7 (Mykonos) = 14, but overlapping days reduce it by 2 (the two flight days). So 14 - 2 = 12 days total. That works.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\nStart in Vilnius for Days 1-4. Then fly to Munich on Day 4. So Munich is Days 4-6 (since 3 days: Day 4,5,6). Then fly to Mykonos on Day 7 (since Munich's last day is Day 6, flight on Day 7). Wait, no. If Munich is Days 4-6, that's 3 days. Then fly to Mykonos on Day 7. But Munich to Mykonos is a direct flight. So Day 7 is counted as both Munich and Mykonos. Wait, but the user is leaving Munich on Day 7, so Munich's days would be 4-6 (3 days), and Mykonos starts on Day 7. Then Mykonos would be Days 7-13 (7 days: 7 to 13 inclusive is 7 days). Then total days: 4 (Vilnius) +3 (Munich) +7 (Mykonos) =14, but subtract the two flight days (Day 4 and Day7) because they are counted in both cities. Wait, but Vilnius to Munich on Day4: Vilnius is Days1-4 (4 days), Munich starts on Day4. Then Munich's days are 4,5,6 (3 days). Then flight to Mykonos on Day7, so Munich's days are 4-6 (3 days), Mykonos starts on Day7. But the flight from Munich to Mykonos is on Day7, so Day7 counts as a day in both Munich and Mykonos. Wait, but the user is only supposed to stay in Munich for 3 days. So Days4-6 in Munich would be 3 days (4,5,6), and Day7 is the flight day, which counts as Mykonos. Wait, no. The flight from Munich to Mykonos on Day7 means that Day7 is counted as a day in both Munich and Mykonos. But the user can't be in Munich and Mykonos on the same day. Wait, the user's instruction says that if you fly from A to B on day X, you are in both cities on day X. So that day counts towards both. So when you fly from Vilnius to Munich on Day4, you spend Day4 in both cities. Similarly, when flying from Munich to Mykonos on Day7, you spend Day7 in both Munich and Mykonos.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step.\n\nStart in Vilnius. Days 1-4: that's 4 days (Days1,2,3,4). Then fly to Munich on Day4. So Day4 is counted in both Vilnius and Munich. So Vilnius gets Days1-4 (4 days), Munich gets Days4-... Now, Munich needs 3 days. So Days4,5,6. Because Day4 is arrival, Day5 and 6 are full days. Then on Day7, fly to Mykonos. So Day7 is counted in both Munich and Mykonos. But Munich's days would be 4,5,6,7? Wait, no. Because the user wants to stay in Munich for 3 days. So if they arrive on Day4, then Days4,5,6 would be 3 days (including the flight day). Then fly out on Day7, which is a flight day counted in Munich and Mykonos. But that would make Munich's days 4,5,6,7? Which is 4 days. That's a problem because they can only stay 3 days in Munich.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust. Let's think: the user must spend exactly 3 days in Munich. Each flight day counts as a day in both cities. So if they arrive in Munich on Day4 (from Vilnius), and leave Munich on Day7 (to Mykonos), then Days4,5,6,7 would be 4 days in Munich. But they need only 3. So that's a problem. Therefore, the flight from Vilnius to Munich must be on a day that allows exactly 3 days in Munich.\n\nWait, let's recalculate. Suppose the user is in Vilnius for Days1-4 (4 days). Then fly to Munich on Day4. So Munich starts on Day4. Now, they need to spend 3 days in Munich. So Days4,5,6. Then fly out on Day7? Wait, no. Because Day7 would be another day in Munich if they fly out then. So maybe they fly out on Day6. But can they fly out on Day6? Let's see.\n\nVilnius: Days1-4 (4 days, including flight day on Day4).\n\nMunich: Days4,5,6. If they fly out on Day6, then Day6 is counted in Munich and Mykonos. But the flight from Munich to Mykonos must be a direct flight. So if they fly on Day6, then Mykonos days would start on Day6. But the user wants to spend 7 days in Mykonos. Days6-12 (7 days: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12). That's 7 days. Total days would be 12 days (Days1-12). But the user's total trip is 12 days. Let's check:\n\nVilnius: 4 days (Days1-4, including Day4 flight)\n\nMunich: Days4,5,6 (3 days, but wait, flying out on Day6, so Munich has Days4,5,6 (3 days) and Mykonos starts on Day6. Then Mykonos Days6-12 (7 days: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12). But that's 7 days. Total days would be 12 days. Let's count:\n\nDays1-4: Vilnius (4 days)\n\nDays4-6: Munich (3 days, but Days4-6 is 3 days: 4,5,6)\n\nDays6-12: Mykonos (7 days: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12)\n\nWait, but Days4-6 in Munich is 3 days (Days4,5,6). Then flying to Mykonos on Day6, so Day6 is counted in both Munich and Mykonos. So Mykonos would have Days6-12, which is 7 days (6 to 12 inclusive). But total days would be 12 days. That works. Because Days1-12 is 12 days. Let's check:\n\nVilnius: Days1-4 (4 days)\n\nMunich: Days4-6 (3 days: 4,5,6)\n\nMykonos: Days6-12 (7 days: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12)\n\nTotal days: 12. Perfect. But wait, the flight from Munich to Mykonos must be a direct flight. According to the user's note, the direct flights are Munich-Mykonos and Vilnius-Munich. So yes, that's possible.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n- Days1-4: Vilnius\n\n- Days4-6: Munich\n\n- Days6-12: Mykonos\n\nBut wait, the user wanted to stay in Mykonos for 7 days. Days6-12 is 7 days (since 12-6+1=7). Yes.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-6\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 6-12\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nThat's 12 days total. Each city gets the required days, using the direct flights available.",
