            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit 5 European cities in 19 days with specific days in each. Let me start by listing all the requirements.\n\nFirst, the cities and their required days: Dubrovnik (5 days), Warsaw (2 days), Stuttgart (7 days, including a conference from day 7 to 13), Bucharest (6 days with a wedding from day 1-6), and Copenhagen (3 days). The total adds up to 5+2+7+6+3=23 days, but the user only has 19 days. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, no, maybe the days overlap because when you fly on day X, you count that day for both cities. So the total days might fit into 19. Let me check the constraints again.\n\nThe wedding in Bucharest is between day 1 and day 6. That's 6 days (days 1-6 inclusive). So Bucharest is 6 days. But the user wants to spend 6 days there, which matches. Then Stuttgart has a conference from day 7 to day 13. That's 7 days (days 7-13 inclusive). Then Dubrovnik 5 days, Warsaw 2 days, Copenhagen 3 days. Let's sum these: 6+7+5+2+3=23. But since flights overlap days, the total days can be 19. So how do these days overlap?\n\nThe user starts in Bucharest for days 1-6 (6 days). Then needs to go to Stuttgart by day 7. So on day 6, they might fly to Stuttgart, which counts day 6 as both Bucharest and Stuttgart. But wait, the wedding is up to day 6, so they have to be in Bucharest until day 6. Then they can fly to Stuttgart on day 6, arriving the same day. But the conference starts on day 7, so maybe they arrive in Stuttgart on day 7. Wait, the conference is during day 7 and day 13. So days 7-13. So Stuttgart is 7 days (days 7-13). But the user wants to spend 7 days there. That works.\n\nBut how do the days add up? Let me try to map this out.\n\nStart in Bucharest for the wedding: days 1-6 (6 days). Then Stuttgart days 7-13 (7 days). Then need to fit Dubrovnik (5), Warsaw (2), Copenhagen (3). That's 6+7+5+2+3=23 days. But total days allowed are 19. So overlapping days via flights is necessary.\n\nSo the key is to plan the flights so that the days in transit overlap. For example, leaving Bucharest on day 6 to fly to Stuttgart, which counts day 6 as both Bucharest and Stuttgart. But the wedding is until day 6, so maybe they leave on day 6, arriving in Stuttgart the same day, thus day 6 is counted for both. Then Stuttgart would be days 6-13, which is 8 days. But the user only wants 7 days in Stuttgart. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nWait, the user needs to attend the conference during day 7 and day 13. So maybe the conference is from day 7 to day 13 inclusive. That's 7 days (7-13). So Stuttgart must be days 7-13. So the user must be in Stuttgart on those days. But how to get there from Bucharest. The direct flights from Bucharest are to Copenhagen and Warsaw. So from Bucharest, they can fly to Warsaw or Copenhagen, but to get to Stuttgart, maybe via Warsaw. Because there's a direct flight between Warsaw and Stuttgart.\n\nSo possible route: Bucharest -> Warsaw -> Stuttgart. But the user needs to be in Stuttgart by day 7. So let's see:\n\nBucharest: days 1-6 (wedding). Then fly to Warsaw on day 6. So day 6 is split between Bucharest and Warsaw. Then spend 2 days in Warsaw: days 6 and 7. But the user wants 2 days in Warsaw. Then fly to Stuttgart on day 7. But the conference in Stuttgart starts on day 7. So they need to be in Stuttgart on day 7. If they fly from Warsaw to Stuttgart on day 7, then day 7 is counted in both Warsaw and Stuttgart. That would make Warsaw days 6-7 (2 days), and Stuttgart days 7-13 (7 days). Then after Stuttgart, they need to go to Dubrovnik and Copenhagen.\n\nWait, let's check the direct flights. From Stuttgart, direct flights are to Copenhagen and Warsaw. To get to Dubrovnik, they need to go through Copenhagen, as there's a direct flight between Copenhagen and Dubrovnik.\n\nSo after Stuttgart, maybe fly to Copenhagen. Then from Copenhagen to Dubrovnik. But let's see the days.\n\nAfter Stuttgart (days 7-13, 7 days), the next days would start at day 14. Let's plan:\n\nStuttgart: days 7-13 (7 days). Then fly to Copenhagen on day 14. Spend 3 days in Copenhagen (days 14-16). Then fly to Dubrovnik on day 16. Spend 5 days in Dubrovnik (days 16-20). But the total days would be 20, which exceeds 19. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the order. Let's see:\n\nAfter Stuttgart (days 7-13), need to visit Warsaw (2 days), Dubrovnik (5), and Copenhagen (3). But the user already used Warsaw for 2 days? Wait, no. Wait, the user wants to visit Warsaw for 2 days. Earlier, I considered flying from Bucharest to Warsaw on day 6, then to Stuttgart on day 7, giving Warsaw 1.5 days. But maybe that's not correct. Let me re-express.\n\nThe user must spend 6 days in Bucharest (days 1-6), then 7 days in Stuttgart (days 7-13), but need to travel between cities with direct flights. Also, the user must visit Warsaw for 2 days, Dubrovnik for 5, Copenhagen for 3.\n\nAnother approach: after Bucharest (days 1-6), fly to Warsaw on day 6. So days in Warsaw: 6 and 7 (2 days). Then fly to Stuttgart on day 7. So Stuttgart starts on day 7. But the conference is during days 7-13, so that's 7 days (7-13). Then after Stuttgart, need to go to Copenhagen (3 days) and Dubrovnik (5 days). Also, the direct flights from Stuttgart are Copenhagen and Warsaw. From Copenhagen, there's a flight to Dubrovnik.\n\nSo after Stuttgart (day 13), fly to Copenhagen on day 14. Spend days 14-16 (3 days). Then fly to Dubrovnik on day 16, spend days 16-20 (5 days). But total days would be 20, which is over. So need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Stuttgart, go to Dubrovnik first. But from Stuttgart, there's no direct flight to Dubrovnik. So need to go via Copenhagen. So Stuttgart -> Copenhagen -> Dubrovnik.\n\nBut that would require:\n\nStuttgart days 7-13 (7 days). Fly to Copenhagen on day 14, stay until day 16 (3 days). Then fly to Dubrovnik on day 17, stay until day 21 (5 days). Total days would be 21, which is way over.\n\nHmm. Maybe another route. Let's see the direct flights again:\n\nCities with direct flights:\n\nWarsaw and Copenhagen\n\nStuttgart and Copenhagen\n\nWarsaw and Stuttgart\n\nBucharest and Copenhagen\n\nBucharest and Warsaw\n\nCopenhagen and Dubrovnik.\n\nSo possible connections:\n\nFrom Bucharest, can fly to Warsaw or Copenhagen.\n\nAfter Bucharest, possible to go to Warsaw, then to Stuttgart.\n\nThen from Stuttgart to Copenhagen, then to Dubrovnik.\n\nBut let's try:\n\nBucharest: days 1-6.\n\nFly to Warsaw on day 6. Warsaw: days 6-7 (2 days).\n\nFly to Stuttgart on day 7. Stuttgart: days 7-13 (7 days).\n\nFly to Copenhagen on day 14. Copenhagen: days 14-16 (3 days).\n\nFly to Dubrovnik on day 17. Dubrovnik: days 17-21 (5 days).\n\nTotal days: 21. But the user has only 19 days. So over by 2.\n\nSo need to adjust.\n\nAlternative: Reduce the days in Copenhagen or Dubrovnik by overlapping.\n\nWait, the user wants 3 days in Copenhagen, 5 in Dubrovnik, 2 in Warsaw, 7 in Stuttgart, 6 in Bucharest. That's fixed. So how to fit into 19 days.\n\nWait, maybe the day counts include the days when flying. For example, flying from Bucharest to Warsaw on day 6 counts day 6 in both cities. So if you have 6 days in Bucharest (days 1-6), then fly to Warsaw on day 6, which adds day 6 to Warsaw. Then Warsaw would be days 6-7 (2 days). Then fly to Stuttgart on day 7, which adds day 7 to Warsaw and Stuttgart. So Stuttgart would be days 7-13 (7 days). Then fly to Copenhagen on day 13, adding day 13 to both Stuttgart and Copenhagen. So Copenhagen would be days 13-15 (3 days). Then fly to Dubrovnik on day 15, which adds day 15 to both Copenhagen and Dubrovnik. Dubrovnik would be days 15-19 (5 days: 15,16,17,18,19). Let's count total days:\n\nBucharest: 1-6 (6 days)\n\nWarsaw: 6-7 (2 days, days 6 and 7)\n\nStuttgart: 7-13 (7 days, days 7 to 13)\n\nCopenhagen: 13-15 (3 days, days 13,14,15)\n\nDubrovnik: 15-19 (5 days, days 15-19)\n\nTotal days: 19. That works.\n\nBut let's check each city's required days:\n\nBucharest: 6 days (days 1-6) \u2705\n\nWarsaw: 2 days (days 6-7) \u2705\n\nStuttgart: 7 days (days 7-13) \u2705\n\nCopenhagen: 3 days (days 13-15) \u2705\n\nDubrovnik: 5 days (days 15-19) \u2705\n\nYes, this works. The flights would be:\n\nBucharest to Warsaw (day 6) - direct flight exists.\n\nWarsaw to Stuttgart (day 7) - direct flight exists.\n\nStuttgart to Copenhagen (day 13) - direct flight exists.\n\nCopenhagen to Dubrovnik (day 15) - direct flight exists.\n\nEach flight is direct, and the days are counted correctly. Let's check the conference in Stuttgart from day 7-13. The user is there days 7-13, which covers the conference. The wedding in Bucharest is days 1-6, which is covered. Each city has the required days with overlaps on travel days. The total is 19 days (from day 1 to day 19). Perfect.",
