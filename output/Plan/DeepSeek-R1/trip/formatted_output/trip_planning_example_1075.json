            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to plan this 25-day trip with the given constraints. The user wants to visit 8 European cities: Vienna (4 days), Lyon (3), Edinburgh (4 with days 5-8), Reykjavik (5), Stuttgart (5), Manchester (2), Split (5, with a wedding from day 19-23), and Prague (4). The flights must be direct as per the list provided.\n\nFirst, let's note the fixed dates. Edinburgh has to be days 5-8. Split's wedding is days 19-23, which is 5 days (days 19,20,21,22,23). Wait, the user wants to spend 5 days in Split, and the wedding is during days 19-23. That's 5 days, so Split must be days 19-23 inclusive. But that's only 5 days, which matches the requirement. So Split is days 19-23.\n\nNow, the other cities: Vienna (4), Lyon (3), Edinburgh (4), Reykjavik (5), Stuttgart (5), Manchester (2), Prague (4). Let's sum the days: 4+3+4+5+5+2+5+4=32. Wait, but total days should be 25. Wait, no, the user is visiting 8 cities, and each day is counted in the city they are in. Wait, the problem says: \"You plan to visit 8 European cities for 25 days in total.\" But the listed cities are 8: Vienna, Lyon, Edinburgh, Reykjavik, Stuttgart, Manchester, Split, Prague. So each of these 8 cities must be included. Wait, but the days add up to 4+3+4+5+5+2+5+4=32 days. That's more than 25. Oh, but the user probably made a mistake here. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait the user says: \"You plan to visit 8 European cities for 25 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 4 days in Vienna. You would like to visit Lyon for 3 days. You plan to stay in Edinburgh for 4 days. From day 5 to day 8, there is a annual show you want to attend in Edinburgh. You want to spend 5 days in Reykjavik. You want to spend 5 days in Stuttgart. You would like to visit Manchester for 2 days. You want to spend 5 days in Split. You are going to attend a wedding in Split between day 19 and day 23. You plan to stay in Prague for 4 days.\"\n\nWait, that's 8 cities: Vienna (4), Lyon (3), Edinburgh (4), Reykjavik (5), Stuttgart (5), Manchester (2), Split (5), Prague (4). Total days: 4+3+4+5+5+2+5+4=32 days. But the total trip is 25 days. That's a problem. There's a contradiction here. The user must have made an error in their requirements. But since we have to proceed, perhaps the numbers are correct and we have to fit them into 25 days. Wait, perhaps the days overlap when traveling. For example, when you fly from city A to city B on day X, you are in both cities on day X, so that day counts for both. But the total days in all cities combined must equal 25. Let's recalculate with that in mind.\n\nWait, each day is counted in the city you're in. If you fly on day X from A to B, you spend day X in both cities. So each travel day counts as a day in both cities, but the total trip days (25) would be the number of days from the first day to the last day. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose you are in City A on day 1, fly to City B on day 2. Then you are in City A on day 1, City B on day 2. So total trip days would be 2 days, but you have two cities. If you fly on day X from A to B, then day X is counted in both cities. So the total days in each city may add up to more than the total trip days. But the user says the total trip is 25 days. So the days in all cities plus the travel days (which are counted in two cities) must sum such that the total days from day 1 to day 25 is 25 days. But how does that reconcile with the required days per city?\n\nWait, perhaps the user's intention is that the total days spent in each city (including travel days where they are in two cities) should add up to the numbers given, but the total duration of the trip is 25 days. So for example, if you spend 4 days in Vienna, that includes any days where they arrived or departed Vienna. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me list all the required days per city:\n\n- Vienna: 4 days\n\n- Lyon: 3 days\n\n- Edinburgh: 4 days (with days 5-8 fixed)\n\n- Reykjavik: 5 days\n\n- Stuttgart: 5 days\n\n- Manchester: 2 days\n\n- Split: 5 days (days 19-23)\n\n- Prague: 4 days\n\nTotal required days per city: 4+3+4+5+5+2+5+4=32 days.\n\nBut the total trip is 25 days. That means that some days are counted in two cities due to travel. For each flight taken, one day is counted in both cities. So each flight reduces the total sum by 1 (since the day is counted twice). For example, if you take a flight on day X from A to B, then day X is counted in both A and B. So the sum of all days per city is 25 + number of flights. Since the user is visiting 8 cities, they need at least 7 flights (to move between them). Each flight adds 1 to the total sum. So the total sum would be 25 + 7 = 32. Which matches the required days. So that makes sense. Therefore, the plan must include 7 flights, each contributing to overlapping days, thus making the sum of days per city 32, which equals the required 4+3+4+5+5+2+5+4=32. So that's correct.\n\nSo the problem is feasible. Now, the task is to arrange the cities in an order that allows direct flights between them, as per the given list, and respecting the fixed dates for Edinburgh (days 5-8) and Split (days 19-23).\n\nLet's start by placing the fixed dates first.\n\nEdinburgh is days 5-8. So days 5,6,7,8 in Edinburgh. So Edinburgh is Day 5-8.\n\nSplit is days 19-23. So Split is Day 19-23.\n\nNow, the other cities need to be arranged before, between, and after these fixed blocks, with the required number of days and direct flights.\n\nLet's list all direct flight connections:\n\nFrom the given list:\n\n- Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Stuttgart and Split, Stuttgart and Vienna, Prague and Manchester, Edinburgh and Prague, Manchester to Split, Prague and Vienna, Vienna and Manchester, Prague and Split, Vienna and Lyon, Stuttgart and Edinburgh, Split and Lyon, Stuttgart and Manchester, Prague and Lyon, Reykjavik and Vienna, Prague and Reykjavik, Vienna and Split.\n\nSo the cities and their connections:\n\nReykjavik connects to: Stuttgart, Vienna, Prague.\n\nStuttgart connects to: Reykjavik, Split, Vienna, Edinburgh, Manchester.\n\nSplit connects to: Stuttgart, Manchester, Prague, Lyon, Vienna.\n\nPrague connects to: Manchester, Edinburgh, Vienna, Split, Reykjavik, Lyon.\n\nVienna connects to: Stuttgart, Prague, Manchester, Lyon, Split, Reykjavik.\n\nEdinburgh connects to: Prague, Stuttgart.\n\nManchester connects to: Prague, Vienna, Split, Stuttgart.\n\nLyon connects to: Vienna, Split, Prague.\n\nSo the flight network is quite connected. Now, we need to arrange the cities in a sequence where each consecutive pair has a direct flight, and the days in each city sum to the required number, considering that travel days count in both cities.\n\nLet's start with the fixed parts.\n\nEdinburgh is days 5-8. So arrival in Edinburgh on day 5 (but maybe arriving on day 5 from another city, which would mean day 5 is also in the previous city). Wait, but according to the user's note: if you fly from A to B on day X, you are in both cities on day X, contributing to the count for each. So Edinburgh must have 4 days, which includes days 5-8. So days 5,6,7,8 are in Edinburgh. But if you arrive in Edinburgh on day 5 from another city, then day 5 is counted in both the previous city and Edinburgh. Similarly, departing Edinburgh on day 8 would mean day 8 is counted in Edinburgh and the next city.\n\nSimilarly, Split is days 19-23. So days 19,20,21,22,23 in Split. So arrival on day 19 (maybe from another city, so day 19 is split between the previous city and Split), and departure on day 23 (day 23 counted in Split and next city).\n\nLet's outline the days:\n\nDays 1-4: Some cities before Edinburgh.\n\nDays 5-8: Edinburgh.\n\nDays 9-18: Cities between Edinburgh and Split.\n\nDays 19-23: Split.\n\nDays 24-25: After Split.\n\nBut need to fit all cities except Edinburgh and Split into the other days, which is:\n\nVienna (4), Lyon (3), Reykjavik (5), Stuttgart (5), Manchester (2), Prague (4).\n\nTotal days: 4+3+5+5+2+4=23 days. But the total days available are:\n\nDays 1-4 (4 days) + days 9-18 (10 days) + days 24-25 (2 days) = 16 days. Wait, that's 4+10+2=16 days. But we need 23 days. This can't be. Hmm, there's a problem here. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, the total trip is 25 days. Days 1-25. Edinburgh is days 5-8 (4 days), Split is days 19-23 (5 days). The remaining days are:\n\nDays 1-4 (4 days), days 9-18 (10 days), days 24-25 (2 days). Total 4+10+2=16 days. But the required days for other cities sum to 23 days. So 16 days available, but 23 needed. This is impossible unless some days overlap through travel.\n\nEach flight between cities can overlap a day. For example, if we have a flight on day X from city A to B, then day X counts for both A and B. So the sum of days in all cities is 25 + number of flights. Since we have 8 cities, there are 7 flights. So sum of days is 25 +7=32, which matches the required 32 days. Therefore, we need to arrange the itinerary such that the days in each city include the travel days, and the flights are arranged to maximize overlapping days.\n\nBut how to fit all the required days into the 25-day span, considering the fixed dates.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, Edinburgh is days 5-8. So arrival on day 5 (possibly from another city, so day 5 is part of that city's count), and departure on day 8 (day 8 is part of Edinburgh and the next city).\n\nSplit is days 19-23. Arrival on day 19 (possibly from another city, day 19 counts there and Split), departure on day 23 (day 23 counts in Split and next city).\n\nNow, let's try to build the itinerary.\n\nPossible starting points: Reykjavik, since it's a starting city with flights to Stuttgart, Vienna, Prague. Alternatively, other cities.\n\nLet me think of possible sequences.\n\nSince Edinburgh is days 5-8, the previous city must be connected to Edinburgh. According to the flight list, Edinburgh connects to Prague and Stuttgart. So before Edinburgh, the traveler must be in either Prague or Stuttgart.\n\nBut days 1-4: need to be in a city that connects to Edinburgh. Let's say the traveler starts in Reykjavik, which connects to Stuttgart, Vienna, Prague.\n\nSuppose the itinerary starts in Reykjavik for 5 days. But Reykjavik needs 5 days. If days 1-5 are in Reykjavik, but Edinburgh starts on day 5. But day 5 would be Reykjavik's last day and Edinburgh's first day. But Edinburgh's days are 5-8. So that could work. But then days 1-5 in Reykjavik (5 days), fly to Edinburgh on day 5. Then Edinburgh is days 5-8. So Reykjavik: days 1-5 (5 days), Edinburgh days 5-8 (4 days). But Reykjavik requires 5 days, which is covered. But then after Edinburgh (day 8), next city must be connected. Edinburgh connects to Prague and Stuttgart.\n\nBut let's see: Reykjavik to Edinburgh? No, Reykjavik's connections are Stuttgart, Vienna, Prague. So to get from Reykjavik to Edinburgh, need to go via Stuttgart or Prague.\n\nWait, the user can only take direct flights. So from Reykjavik, you can only fly to Stuttgart, Vienna, or Prague. So to reach Edinburgh, you need to fly from Reykjavik to Stuttgart or Prague, then to Edinburgh.\n\nSo possible route: Reykjavik -> Stuttgart -> Edinburgh.\n\nBut let's check if that's feasible with days.\n\nSuppose:\n\nDays 1-5: Reykjavik (5 days). Fly to Stuttgart on day 5.\n\nStuttgart: days 5-... Since the flight is on day 5, day 5 is counted in both Reykjavik and Stuttgart. So Stuttgart starts on day 5. But Edinburgh must start on day 5. That's conflicting. Because Edinburgh needs days 5-8. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that Edinburgh must be days 5-8, so the arrival to Edinburgh must be on day 5. The city before Edinburgh must have a flight to Edinburgh, which are Prague or Stuttgart.\n\nSo days 1-4: in a city that connects to either Prague or Stuttgart, then fly to Edinburgh on day 5.\n\nWait, but days 1-4: need to be in a city that can connect to Prague or Stuttgart, which then connect to Edinburgh.\n\nAlternatively, the traveler could be in Prague for days 1-4, then fly to Edinburgh on day 5. But Prague needs 4 days, which would be days 1-4. Then day 5 is in Prague and Edinburgh. But Edinburgh needs to start on day 5. So Prague: days 1-4, fly to Edinburgh on day 5. So Prague gets 4 days (days 1-4), Edinburgh days 5-8 (4 days). That works for Prague and Edinburgh.\n\nBut then after Edinburgh, where to go? From Edinburgh, can go to Prague or Stuttgart. Let's say after Edinburgh (days 5-8), fly to Stuttgart on day 8. So day 8 is in Edinburgh and Stuttgart. Stuttgart then starts on day 8. Stuttgart needs 5 days: days 8-12 (5 days, including day 8). Then fly to another city.\n\nBut then we have to fit in Reykjavik (5 days), Vienna (4), Lyon (3), Manchester (2), Split (5), and others.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible route.\n\nOption 1:\n\nStart in Reykjavik (5 days), fly to Stuttgart (day 5), then Stuttgart for days 5-9 (5 days, including day 5), then fly to Edinburgh on day 9. But Edinburgh needs to be days 5-8. This doesn't work.\n\nOption 2:\n\nStart in Prague (4 days: days 1-4), fly to Edinburgh on day 5. Edinburgh days 5-8. Then from Edinburgh, fly to Stuttgart on day 8. Stuttgart days 8-12 (5 days). Then from Stuttgart, fly to Vienna (connected). Vienna days 12-15 (4 days, including day 12). Then fly to Lyon (connected) on day 15. Lyon days 15-17 (3 days). Fly to Manchester (connected via Vienna? Wait, Vienna connects to Manchester. Or Lyon connects to Prague, Vienna, Split. From Lyon, can fly to Manchester via Vienna? No, must be direct. From Lyon, direct flights are to Vienna, Split, Prague. So to get to Manchester, need to go via another city. So after Lyon, maybe fly to Vienna, then Manchester. But this adds more steps.\n\nAlternatively, after Stuttgart (days 8-12), fly to Vienna (day 12). Vienna days 12-15 (4 days, days 12,13,14,15). Then fly to Lyon (direct) on day 15. Lyon days 15-17 (3 days). Then fly to Split (connected from Lyon) on day 17. But Split is days 19-23. So days 17-18 would be in Split, but the wedding is days 19-23. That's a problem. Alternatively, after Lyon, go to Manchester. But Lyon doesn't connect directly to Manchester. So need to go via another city. From Lyon, possible flights to Vienna, Prague, or Split. So from Lyon, fly to Manchester via Vienna. So day 17: fly from Lyon to Vienna (day 17), then day 17 in both Lyon and Vienna. Then Vienna to Manchester (direct flight exists). Fly on day 17 or 18. This is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, after Stuttgart, go to Manchester. Stuttgart connects to Manchester. So Stuttgart days 8-12, fly to Manchester on day 12. Manchester days 12-13 (2 days, including day 12). Then fly to Split (Manchester connects to Split). But Split is days 19-23. So Manchester would be days 12-13, then fly to Split on day 13. Split days 13-17. But the wedding is days 19-23. So this doesn't work.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try a different route.\n\nAnother approach: Start in Reykjavik (5 days: days 1-5). Fly to Edinburgh on day 5. Wait, but Reykjavik doesn't have a direct flight to Edinburgh. So Reykjavik can only fly to Stuttgart, Vienna, or Prague. So from Reykjavik, fly to Stuttgart (day 5). Then Stuttgart days 5-9 (5 days). Then from Stuttgart, fly to Edinburgh (connected) on day 9. But Edinburgh needs to be days 5-8. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: The fixed Edinburgh days are 5-8, so we need to be in Edinburgh those days. The city before Edinburgh must be connected, which is Prague or Stuttgart. Let's try starting in Stuttgart.\n\nStuttgart: days 1-5 (5 days). Fly to Edinburgh on day 5. Edinburgh days 5-8. Then from Edinburgh, fly to Prague (connected). Prague days 8-11 (4 days, including day 8). Then fly to Reykjavik (connected). Reykjavik days 11-15 (5 days). Then fly to Vienna (connected). Vienna days 15-18 (4 days). Then fly to Lyon (connected) on day 18. Lyon days 18-20 (3 days). Fly to Split (connected) on day 20. But Split needs to start on day 19. So this is conflicting. Days 20-24 in Split (5 days), but the wedding is days 19-23. So not matching.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the Split days. The wedding is days 19-23, so Split must be those days. So need to arrive in Split by day 19.\n\nLet's think backwards. Split is days 19-23. The city before Split must be one that has a direct flight to Split. Possible cities: Stuttgart, Manchester, Prague, Vienna, Lyon. So the previous city could be Lyon, for example. Suppose before Split, the traveler is in Lyon for 3 days. Then fly to Split on day 19. So Lyon days 16-18 (3 days), fly to Split on day 19. Split days 19-23. Then after Split, go to another city. But need to fit Manchester, Prague, Vienna, Reykjavik, Stuttgart.\n\nAlternatively, before Split, the traveler is in Manchester. Manchester for 2 days: days 17-18, fly to Split on day 19. But Manchester connects to Split.\n\nBut how to get to Manchester? Let's try to build the itinerary in reverse.\n\nSplit: days 19-23.\n\nBefore Split, possible cities: Lyon (3 days), Manchester (2), etc.\n\nSuppose the traveler is in Lyon for 3 days: days 16-18, fly to Split on day 19.\n\nLyon connects to Vienna, Split, Prague. So to get to Lyon, maybe from Vienna.\n\nVienna: 4 days. Suppose days 12-15 (including day 12 arrival). Fly to Lyon on day 15. Lyon days 15-17 (3 days), fly to Split on day 18. But Split needs to start on day 19. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, Vienna days 12-15, fly to Lyon day 15. Lyon days 15-17 (3 days), fly to Split on day 18. Split days 18-22. But the wedding is days 19-23. So Split must start on day 19. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, fly to Split on day 19 from Lyon. So Lyon days 16-18, fly on day 19. Split days 19-23. That works.\n\nSo how to reach Lyon by day 16.\n\nLet's see:\n\nEdinburgh days 5-8.\n\nAfter Edinburgh, next city could be Prague (connected). Prague days 8-11 (4 days). Fly to Vienna (connected) on day 11. Vienna days 11-14 (4 days). Fly to Lyon on day 14. Lyon days 14-16 (3 days). Fly to Split on day 16. But Split needs to start on day 19. So this is too early.\n\nAlternatively, after Edinburgh (days 5-8), fly to Stuttgart (connected). Stuttgart days 8-12 (5 days). Fly to Vienna on day 12. Vienna days 12-15 (4 days). Fly to Lyon on day 15. Lyon days 15-17 (3 days). Fly to Split on day 17. Split days 17-21. But the wedding is days 19-23. Overlap only days 19-21. Not sufficient. Needs to be days 19-23.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try a different approach.\n\nSplit must be days 19-23. So arrival on day 19 from another city, say Manchester. Manchester days 17-18 (2 days), fly to Split on day 19. Manchester connects to Split.\n\nTo get to Manchester by day 17, perhaps from Prague. Prague days 13-16 (4 days), fly to Manchester on day 16. Manchester days 16-17 (2 days). Fly to Split on day 17. But Split needs to start on day 19. This doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, Manchester days 17-18 (2 days), fly to Split on day 19. So Manchester is days 17-18. To get to Manchester, perhaps from Vienna. Vienna days 14-17 (4 days), fly to Manchester on day 17. Then Manchester days 17-18. Fly to Split on day 19.\n\nBut how to fit Vienna into the itinerary.\n\nEdinburgh days 5-8. After Edinburgh, fly to Prague (day 8). Prague days 8-11 (4 days). Fly to Reykjavik (connected) on day 11. Reykjavik days 11-15 (5 days). Fly to Vienna (connected) on day 15. Vienna days 15-18 (4 days). Fly to Manchester on day 18. Manchester days 18-19 (2 days). Fly to Split on day 19. Split days 19-23. Then after Split, need to go to Lyon for 3 days. Split connects to Lyon. Split days 19-23, fly to Lyon on day 23. Lyon days 23-25 (3 days, but only 3 days would require days 23,24,25. But the total trip is 25 days, so that's possible.\n\nBut let's check the connections:\n\nEdinburgh (days 5-8) -> Prague (days 8-11): direct flight exists.\n\nPrague -> Reykjavik: direct flight.\n\nReykjavik -> Vienna: direct flight.\n\nVienna -> Manchester: direct flight.\n\nManchester -> Split: direct flight.\n\nSplit -> Lyon: direct flight.\n\nLyon needs 3 days: days 23-25 (3 days: 23,24,25). That works.\n\nNow check the days:\n\n- Edinburgh: days 5-8 (4 days)\n\n- Prague: days 8-11 (4 days: days 8,9,10,11)\n\n- Reykjavik: days 11-15 (5 days: 11,12,13,14,15)\n\n- Vienna: days 15-18 (4 days: 15,16,17,18)\n\n- Manchester: days 18-19 (2 days: 18,19)\n\n- Split: days 19-23 (5 days: 19,20,21,22,23)\n\n- Lyon: days 23-25 (3 days: 23,24,25)\n\nBut wait, what about Stuttgart? The user wants 5 days in Stuttgart. This itinerary skips Stuttgart. So this approach omits Stuttgart, which is required. So this is invalid.\n\nAh, right, the user wants to visit all 8 cities: Vienna, Lyon, Edinburgh, Reykjavik, Stuttgart, Manchester, Split, Prague. So the above itinerary misses Stuttgart. Need to include Stuttgart.\n\nLet's try another route including Stuttgart.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nEdinburgh days 5-8. Before Edinburgh, Stuttgart days 1-4, fly to Edinburgh on day 5.\n\nStuttgart days 1-4 (4 days). But the user wants 5 days in Stuttgart. So that's insufficient.\n\nAlternatively, Stuttgart days 1-5 (5 days). Fly to Edinburgh on day 5. Edinburgh days 5-8 (4 days). Then from Edinburgh, fly to Prague (connected). Prague days 8-11 (4 days). Fly to Reykjavik (connected) on day 11. Reykjavik days 11-15 (5 days). Fly to Vienna (connected) on day 15. Vienna days 15-18 (4 days). Fly to Manchester (connected) on day 18. Manchester days 18-19 (2 days). Fly to Split (connected) on day 19. Split days 19-23 (5 days). Fly to Lyon (connected) on day 23. Lyon days 23-25 (3 days). \n\nThis includes Stuttgart (5 days), Edinburgh (4), Prague (4), Reykjavik (5), Vienna (4), Manchester (2), Split (5), Lyon (3). But where is Stuttgart in this itinerary? Oh, in this case, Stuttgart is days 1-5. Fly to Edinburgh on day 5. So Stuttgart: days 1-5 (5 days, including day 5). Edinburgh: days 5-8 (4 days). Then proceed as before. This works.\n\nBut check the connections:\n\nStuttgart to Edinburgh: direct flight exists.\n\nEdinburgh to Prague: yes.\n\nPrague to Reykjavik: yes.\n\nReykjavik to Vienna: yes.\n\nVienna to Manchester: yes.\n\nManchester to Split: yes.\n\nSplit to Lyon: yes.\n\nLyon's days: 23-25 (3 days). \n\nNow check all cities:\n\n- Stuttgart: days 1-5 (5)\n\n- Edinburgh: 5-8 (4)\n\n- Prague: 8-11 (4)\n\n- Reykjavik:11-15 (5)\n\n- Vienna:15-18 (4)\n\n- Manchester:18-19 (2)\n\n- Split:19-23 (5)\n\n- Lyon:23-25 (3)\n\nTotal days per city: 5+4+4+5+4+2+5+3=32. Total trip days:25. Which matches the required sum with 7 flights (25+7=32). \n\nYes, this works. Now verify the direct flights between each consecutive cities:\n\n1. Stuttgart to Edinburgh: Yes, direct flight exists.\n\n2. Edinburgh to Prague: Yes.\n\n3. Prague to Reykjavik: Yes.\n\n4. Reykjavik to Vienna: Yes.\n\n5. Vienna to Manchester: Yes.\n\n6. Manchester to Split: Yes.\n\n7. Split to Lyon: Yes.\n\nAll connections are valid.\n\nNow check the fixed dates:\n\n- Edinburgh days 5-8: Correct.\n\n- Split days 19-23: Correct.\n\nAll required cities are included with the correct number of days.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the itinerary would be:\n\nDay 1-5: Stuttgart\n\nDay 5-8: Edinburgh\n\nDay 8-11: Prague\n\nDay 11-15: Reykjavik\n\nDay 15-18: Vienna\n\nDay 18-19: Manchester\n\nDay 19-23: Split\n\nDay 23-25: Lyon\n\nThis covers all 8 cities, the required days, and direct flights.",
