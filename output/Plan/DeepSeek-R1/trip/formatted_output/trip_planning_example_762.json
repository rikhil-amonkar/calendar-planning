            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a 13-day trip visiting 6 European cities: Dublin, Madrid, Oslo, London, Vilnius, and Berlin. Each city has specific day requirements and certain constraints about when they need to be there. Also, the flights have to be direct between the cities as per the given list.\n\nFirst, let's list out the requirements:\n\n- Total days: 13\n- Cities and days:\n  - Dublin: 3 days, with friends between days 7-9.\n  - Madrid: 2 days, relatives between days 2-3.\n  - Oslo: 3 days\n  - London: 2 days\n  - Vilnius: 3 days\n  - Berlin: 5 days, wedding between days 3-7.\n\nThe direct flight connections are between:\n- London and Madrid\n- Oslo and Vilnius\n- Berlin and Vilnius\n- Madrid and Oslo\n- Madrid and Berlin\n- London and Oslo\n- Madrid and Dublin\n- Berlin and Oslo\n- Dublin and Oslo\n- London and Dublin\n- London and Berlin\n- Berlin and Dublin\n\nSo, the challenge is to arrange the cities in an order that allows direct flights between each consecutive city, while meeting the day constraints.\n\nLet's start by noting the fixed parts:\n\n1. Madrid must be days 2-3 (since the user is visiting relatives there). So Madrid is days 2 and 3. But the user needs 2 days in Madrid, which could be days 2-3. Wait, day range is inclusive, right? So if they arrive on day 2, stay day 3, then that's 2 days. So Madrid is days 2-3.\n\n2. Berlin has a wedding from day 3 to day 7. But the user needs to stay in Berlin for 5 days. So days 3-7 inclusive would be 5 days (days 3,4,5,6,7). That fits. So Berlin must be days 3-7. But wait, the user is supposed to spend 5 days in Berlin, but the wedding is days 3-7. So the Berlin stay has to include those days. But according to the problem statement, the user is attending the wedding in Berlin between day 3 and 7, which means they have to be in Berlin during those days. So Berlin's 5 days must include days 3-7. Wait, days 3-7 is 5 days (3,4,5,6,7). So Berlin's 5 days are exactly days 3-7.\n\nBut wait, the user also has to be in Madrid on days 2-3. So day 3 is both Madrid and Berlin? Because if you fly from Madrid to Berlin on day 3, you spend part of day 3 in Madrid and part in Berlin. So day 3 counts as a day in both cities. Therefore, the Madrid stay is days 2-3 (2 days), and Berlin starts on day 3. But Berlin's days would then be days 3-7 (5 days). So Madrid is days 2-3, Berlin days 3-7. But that would mean on day 3, the user is in both Madrid and Berlin. That's allowed per the problem statement.\n\nBut then, how do we fit the other cities? Let's outline the days:\n\nTotal days: 13. So days 1 to 13.\n\nLet's try to sketch the itinerary step by step.\n\nStart with the fixed parts:\n\n- Madrid: days 2-3 (since relatives are there between days 2-3). So arrival on day 2, leave on day 3 or 4? Wait, if they arrive in Madrid on day 2, spend day 2 and 3 there, then leave on day 4. But the requirement is 2 days in Madrid. So days 2-3 would be 2 days. So departure from Madrid would be on day 4.\n\nBut then Berlin's wedding is days 3-7, but the user is in Madrid until day 3. So how to get to Berlin by day 3? Wait, maybe the flight from Madrid to Berlin happens on day 3. So on day 3, they are in both Madrid and Berlin. So Madrid days 2-3 (2 days), Berlin days 3-7 (5 days). That works because day 3 is counted in both cities.\n\nBut the problem says that if you fly from A to B on day X, you are in both A and B on day X, contributing to the total days in each. So the 2 days in Madrid would be days 2 and 3 (since day 3 is a travel day from Madrid to Berlin). Similarly, Berlin would have days 3-7 (5 days).\n\nThen, after Berlin, which ends on day 7, the next part is Dublin. The user wants to meet friends in Dublin between days 7-9. So they need to be in Dublin during days 7-9. But Berlin ends on day 7. So the flight from Berlin to Dublin would be on day 7. Thus, day 7 is counted in both Berlin and Dublin. Since Berlin's 5 days are days 3-7, and Dublin's 3 days would need to include days 7-9. So Dublin would be days 7-9. That's 3 days (7,8,9). Then after Dublin, we have other cities to fit.\n\nBut let's check the flight connections. Berlin and Dublin have a direct flight, so that's possible.\n\nNow, after Dublin (days 7-9), what's left? The cities to visit are London, Oslo, Vilnius. The user needs 2 days in London, 3 in Oslo, and 3 in Vilnius. So total days after day 9 would be days 10-13 (4 days). But we need 2+3+3=8 days, which is impossible. Wait, that can't be. Wait, let's check the total days required:\n\nDublin:3, Madrid:2, Oslo:3, London:2, Vilnius:3, Berlin:5. Total is 3+2+3+2+3+5=18 days. But the total trip is 13 days. Wait, that's impossible. Oh wait, the user says \"You plan to visit 6 European cities for 13 days in total.\" But according to their own requirements, the sum of days is 3+2+3+2+3+5=18 days. That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the user says: \"You plan to visit 6 European cities for 13 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 3 days in Dublin. You would like to meet your friends at Dublin between day 7 and day 9 to tour together. You would like to visit Madrid for 2 days. You plan to visit relatives in Madrid between day 2 and day 3. You plan to stay in Oslo for 3 days. You would like to visit London for 2 days. You want to spend 3 days in Vilnius. You plan to stay in Berlin for 5 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Berlin between day 3 and day 7.\"\n\nWait, the total days required sum up to 3+2+3+2+3+5=18 days, but the trip is only 13 days. So how is that possible? Because some days overlap when traveling. For example, if you fly from city A to city B on day X, you spend day X in both cities, so those days are counted in both. Therefore, the total days can be less than the sum of individual city days because of overlapping days.\n\nSo the challenge is to arrange the cities in such a way that the overlapping days reduce the total to 13.\n\nSo let's recalculate with possible overlaps.\n\nLet's start building the itinerary step by step.\n\nFirst, the fixed constraints:\n\n1. Madrid must be days 2-3 (visiting relatives), so days 2 and 3 in Madrid. But since they can fly out on day 3, which would count as a day in both Madrid and the next city.\n\n2. Berlin wedding is days 3-7. So they need to be in Berlin from day 3 to day 7. But they are in Madrid on day 3. So they must fly from Madrid to Berlin on day 3, which allows day 3 to count for both Madrid and Berlin. Therefore, Madrid is days 2-3 (2 days), Berlin is days 3-7 (5 days, including day 3). That works.\n\nSo days 1: ?\n\nWait, the trip starts on day 1. So day 1 must be somewhere.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified any constraints for day 1. The first fixed constraint is Madrid on day 2-3. So day 1 must be in another city. Which city?\n\nPossible cities to start: London, Dublin, Oslo, Vilnius, Berlin, Madrid. But Madrid is on day 2-3, so the first city could be a city that has a direct flight to Madrid, allowing the user to fly there on day 2.\n\nLooking at direct flights to Madrid: London, Oslo, Berlin, Dublin.\n\nSo possible first cities: London, Oslo, Berlin, Dublin.\n\nBut the user needs to be in Madrid on day 2. So the first city must be one that can fly directly to Madrid, and the user would spend day 1 there, then fly to Madrid on day 2.\n\nFor example:\n\nDay 1: London\n\nDay 2: Fly to Madrid (arrive on day 2), so days 2-3 in Madrid.\n\nBut the user needs to spend 2 days in London. Wait, no, the user wants to visit London for 2 days. So maybe starting in London for day 1, then fly to Madrid on day 2. But that would only give 1 day in London (day 1), but the user needs 2 days. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting in another city.\n\nWait, let's think again. The user has to visit London for 2 days. So wherever London is placed, it needs to have 2 days. Let's see.\n\nIf the user starts in London on day 1, then day 1 and day 2 would be in London (2 days), then fly to Madrid on day 2. Wait, but flying on day 2 would mean day 2 is counted in both London and Madrid. So London would have days 1-2 (2 days), Madrid days 2-3 (2 days). That works.\n\nBut then, after Madrid, the user needs to go to Berlin on day 3, which is possible via a direct flight (Madrid and Berlin have a direct flight). So days 3-7 in Berlin. Then, after Berlin, they need to go to Dublin for days 7-9 (3 days). Berlin and Dublin have a direct flight, so possible. Then after Dublin, they need to visit Oslo (3 days), Vilnius (3 days), and London (already done?), but wait, London was already covered. Wait no, the user needs to visit London for 2 days. If we started in London days 1-2, that's already covered. But then we have Oslo, Vilnius left. So after Dublin (days 7-9), we have days 10-13 left (4 days). Oslo needs 3 days, Vilnius 3 days. That's 6 days needed, but only 4 days left. So overlapping is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order after Berlin is different.\n\nWait, let's try this:\n\nItinerary:\n\nDay 1-2: London (2 days)\n\nDay 2-3: Madrid (2 days) (fly from London to Madrid on day 2)\n\nDay 3-7: Berlin (5 days) (fly from Madrid to Berlin on day 3)\n\nDay 7-9: Dublin (3 days) (fly from Berlin to Dublin on day 7)\n\nNow, days 10-13: Need to fit Oslo (3 days), Vilnius (3 days). That's 4 days left, but need 6 days. So overlapping is needed.\n\nPossible route: From Dublin, fly to Oslo (direct flight exists). Then spend days 10-12 in Oslo (3 days), overlapping on day 10 (fly from Dublin to Oslo on day 10, so day 10 counts for both Dublin and Oslo. But Dublin ends on day 9, so day 10 would be Oslo. Wait, no. If you fly from Dublin to Oslo on day 10, then day 10 is counted in Oslo. So Oslo days 10-12 (3 days). Then fly to Vilnius (direct flight exists between Oslo and Vilnius). Fly on day 13, which would be day 13 in both Oslo and Vilnius. But Vilnius needs 3 days. So days 13-15, but the trip is only 13 days. That's not possible.\n\nHmm. This approach isn't working. Let's try a different order.\n\nAlternative approach: After Berlin (days 3-7), go to Dublin (days 7-9). Then from Dublin, perhaps fly to London (direct flight exists), but London needs 2 days. If days 10-11 in London, then days 12-14 would be needed for Oslo and Vilnius, but the trip ends on day 13. So days 12-13: 2 days. Oslo needs 3 days and Vilnius 3. Not enough.\n\nAlternative: After Dublin (days 7-9), fly to Oslo (direct flight exists). Spend days 10-12 in Oslo (3 days). Then fly to Vilnius on day 13 (direct flight), but Vilnius needs 3 days, so only day 13 is possible. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, from Oslo to Vilnius on day 12, so days 12-14 in Vilnius, but again, trip ends on day 13.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe the initial order is wrong.\n\nLet's consider starting in a different city. For example, start in Oslo.\n\nDay 1: Oslo\n\nBut then need to get to Madrid by day 2. Oslo has a direct flight to Madrid. So fly from Oslo to Madrid on day 2. Then Madrid days 2-3, then Berlin days 3-7. Then Dublin days 7-9. Then from Dublin, perhaps fly to London (direct flight exists), spend days 10-11 in London. Then days 12-14 in Vilnius and Berlin? No, Berlin is already done. Wait, but Vilnius needs 3 days. So days 12-14, but trip ends on day 13. So days 12-13: 2 days. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after London, fly to Vilnius. Direct flights from London to Vilnius? No, according to the given list, London's direct flights are Madrid, Oslo, Dublin, Berlin. So London to Berlin is possible, but Berlin is already visited. So maybe from London to Oslo, then Oslo to Vilnius.\n\nBut time is tight.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe include Vilnius and Oslo in the middle.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart in Vilnius. But how to connect to Madrid? Vilnius has direct flights to Oslo and Berlin. If starting in Vilnius, days 1-3, then fly to Oslo (day 4), but then need to get to Madrid by day 2. Not possible.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to outline all cities and their required days, and see how to fit them with overlaps.\n\nCities:\n\n- Dublin: 3 days (must include days 7-9)\n- Madrid: 2 days (days 2-3)\n- Oslo: 3 days\n- London: 2 days\n- Vilnius: 3 days\n- Berlin: 5 days (days 3-7)\n\nTotal days: 13.\n\nLet's try to arrange the itinerary:\n\nDay 1: ?\n\nDay 2-3: Madrid\n\nDay 3-7: Berlin\n\nDay 7-9: Dublin\n\nThat's days 1-9. Now, days 10-13 left (4 days), need to fit Oslo (3), London (2), Vilnius (3). But that's 8 days. Impossible unless overlapping.\n\nAlternative: Maybe London is visited before Madrid.\n\nFor example:\n\nDay 1-2: London (2 days)\n\nFly to Madrid on day 2 (so day 2 is counted in both London and Madrid)\n\nDay 2-3: Madrid (2 days)\n\nFly to Berlin on day 3\n\nDay 3-7: Berlin (5 days)\n\nFly to Dublin on day 7\n\nDay 7-9: Dublin (3 days)\n\nNow, days 10-13 left: Need to fit Oslo (3) and Vilnius (3). That's 6 days, but only 4 days left. So must overlap.\n\nFrom Dublin, possible direct flights to Oslo. Fly to Oslo on day 10.\n\nDay 10-12: Oslo (3 days) [days 10,11,12]\n\nFly to Vilnius on day 13 (direct flight exists). Day 13 counts for both Oslo and Vilnius. So Vilnius would have days 13, but needs 3. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, fly from Dublin to Oslo on day 9. So days 9-11 in Oslo (3 days), but day 9 is already part of Dublin. So day 9 counts for both Dublin and Oslo. Then Oslo days 9-11. Then Vilnius days 12-14, but trip ends on day 13. So days 12-13 in Vilnius. Still only 2 days, but needs 3.\n\nNot working.\n\nAlternative idea: Include Vilnius and Oslo before Dublin.\n\nBut after Berlin (days 3-7), maybe go to Oslo first, then Vilnius, then Dublin.\n\nWait, Berlin to Oslo: direct flight exists. So days 7-9 in Oslo? But Dublin needs to be days 7-9. Conflict.\n\nAlternatively, after Berlin (ends day 7), fly to Oslo on day 7, so Oslo days 7-9 (3 days, with day 7 counted in both Berlin and Oslo). Then Dublin needs to be days 7-9, but Oslo is there. Conflict.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the key is to have overlapping days in Vilnius and Oslo.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the required days for each city:\n\nBerlin: 5 days (3-7)\n\nMadrid: 2 days (2-3)\n\nDublin: 3 days (7-9)\n\nThat's days 2-3 (Madrid), 3-7 (Berlin), 7-9 (Dublin). Now, days 1, and 10-13 are left.\n\nDays 1: Need to assign a city. Possible options: London, Oslo, Vilnius.\n\nIf day 1 is London, then fly to Madrid on day 2. That gives London 1 day (day 1), but needs 2. So maybe days 1-2 in London, fly to Madrid on day 2. So London days 1-2 (2 days), Madrid days 2-3 (2 days). That works.\n\nThen after Dublin (days 7-9), days 10-13 left. Need to fit Oslo (3) and Vilnius (3). Let's see:\n\nFrom Dublin, fly to Oslo on day 10. Days 10-12 in Oslo (3 days). Then fly to Vilnius on day 13. Vilnius days 13 (only 1 day). Not enough.\n\nAlternative: From Dublin, fly to Vilnius. But no direct flight according to the list. Direct flights from Dublin are Oslo, London, Berlin, Madrid. So no direct flight to Vilnius. So must go through Oslo or Berlin.\n\nBut Berlin is already visited. So from Dublin to Oslo (direct), then Oslo to Vilnius (direct).\n\nSo days 10-12 in Oslo: days 10-12 (3 days). Then fly to Vilnius on day 13: day 13 in Vilnius. Only 1 day, but needs 3. Not possible.\n\nAlternative: After Dublin, fly to London. But London is already done (days 1-2). No, the user needs to visit London for 2 days, which we've already allocated days 1-2. So that's covered. But then we still have Oslo and Vilnius left.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial allocation is wrong. Maybe London is visited later.\n\nAlternative itinerary:\n\nDay 1: Vilnius\n\nDay 2: Fly to Oslo (direct flight exists). Day 2-4 in Oslo (3 days). But need to be in Madrid on day 2-3. Conflict.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's try to have Oslo and Vilnius back-to-back since they have a direct flight.\n\nFor example:\n\nAfter Berlin (days 3-7), fly to Oslo on day 7. Days 7-9 in Oslo (3 days, with day 7 in both Berlin and Oslo). Then fly to Vilnius on day 10. Days 10-12 in Vilnius (3 days). Then fly to Dublin on day 13? But Dublin needs to be days 7-9. Conflict.\n\nNo, Dublin must be days 7-9. So this approach won't work.\n\nWait, the user must be in Dublin during days 7-9. So after Berlin (ends day 7), they must fly to Dublin on day 7, making days 7-9 in Dublin.\n\nSo after Dublin, days 10-13 left. Need to fit Oslo (3), Vilnius (3), and London (2). But London was already allocated days 1-2.\n\nWait, if we didn't allocate London yet, then perhaps:\n\nItinerary:\n\nDay 1-2: London (2 days)\n\nDay 2-3: Madrid (2 days)\n\nDay 3-7: Berlin (5 days)\n\nDay 7-9: Dublin (3 days)\n\nThen days 10-13: Oslo and Vilnius.\n\nBut Oslo needs 3 days and Vilnius 3. That's 6 days needed, but only 4 available. So overlapping is required.\n\nFrom Dublin, fly to Oslo on day 10. Days 10-12 in Oslo (3 days). Then fly to Vilnius on day 13. Day 13 in Vilnius. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, fly from Dublin to Oslo on day 9. Days 9-11 in Oslo (3 days). Then fly to Vilnius on day 12. Days 12-14 in Vilnius. But trip ends on day 13. So Vilnius gets 2 days.\n\nStill not enough. So this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative Idea: Include Vilnius and Oslo before Berlin.\n\nBut how? The user must be in Berlin from day 3-7. So before that, days 1-2 could be elsewhere.\n\nFor example:\n\nDay 1-2: Oslo (2 days)\n\nFly to Madrid on day 2. Days 2-3: Madrid (2 days)\n\nThen Berlin days 3-7.\n\nBut Oslo needs 3 days. So days 1-3 in Oslo. But then Madrid must be days 2-3, which conflicts. Can't be in both Oslo and Madrid on day 3.\n\nAlternative: Days 1-3 in Oslo. Fly to Madrid on day 3. Days 3-4 in Madrid. But the user needs to visit relatives in Madrid between day 2-3. So this would miss that constraint.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAnother Idea: Start in London days 1-2, Madrid days 2-3, Berlin 3-7, Dublin 7-9. Then, the remaining cities are Oslo and Vilnius. Let's see:\n\nFrom Dublin, fly to Oslo (direct) on day 10. Days 10-12 in Oslo (3 days). Then fly to Vilnius on day 13. Vilnius gets day 13. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, from Dublin, fly to London (direct) on day 10. But London already has days 1-2. Can't reuse unless the user hasn't spent the required days there. But the user needs 2 days in London, which were already covered.\n\nSo this approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption about London is wrong. Maybe London is visited after Dublin.\n\nFor example:\n\nDays 1: Madrid (but relatives are days 2-3. So day 1 can't be Madrid. So start elsewhere.\n\nDay 1: London\n\nDay 2: London and fly to Madrid (day 2). Madrid days 2-3.\n\nBerlin days 3-7.\n\nDublin days 7-9.\n\nThen days 10-13: Oslo and Vilnius.\n\nBut London needs 2 days. If days 1-2 in London, then fly to Madrid on day 2. That gives London 2 days (days 1 and 2). Madrid days 2-3. Then Berlin 3-7. Dublin 7-9. Oslo and Vilnius days 10-13.\n\nOslo and Vilnius need 3 days each. That's 6 days, but only 4 available. So overlapping.\n\nFrom Dublin, fly to Oslo on day 10. Days 10-12 in Oslo (3 days). Fly to Vilnius on day 13. Vilnius gets day 13. Not enough.\n\nAlternative: Fly from Dublin to Oslo on day 9. Days 9-11 in Oslo (3 days). Fly to Vilnius on day 12. Days 12-14 in Vilnius. But trip ends on day 13. So Vilnius gets 2 days. Still insufficient.\n\nThis is really challenging. Perhaps the only way is to have some cities overlapping more days.\n\nWait, what if Vilnius is visited after Oslo, and they share a day?\n\nFor example:\n\nDays 10-12: Oslo (3 days)\n\nDays 12-14: Vilnius (3 days, but trip ends on day 13). So Vilnius days 12-13: 2 days.\n\nBut needs 3 days. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, could Oslo and Vilnius be visited before Berlin?\n\nBut the user must be in Berlin from day 3-7. So before that, days 1-2 could be in London and Madrid, but that leaves no time for Oslo and Vilnius.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the flight from Berlin to Dublin can be via Oslo, allowing Oslo to be visited in between.\n\nFor example:\n\nBerlin to Oslo (direct flight exists), then Oslo to Dublin (direct flight exists).\n\nSo after Berlin (days 3-7), fly to Oslo on day 7. Days 7-9 in Oslo (3 days, with day 7 counted in both Berlin and Oslo). Then fly to Dublin on day 10. But Dublin must be days 7-9. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, from Berlin to Dublin on day 7. So Dublin days 7-9. Then from Dublin, fly to Oslo on day 10. Days 10-12 in Oslo, then fly to Vilnius on day 13. Not enough.\n\nAnother Idea: What if Vilnius is visited before Berlin?\n\nFor example:\n\nDay 1-3: Vilnius\n\nFly to Berlin on day 3. Berlin days 3-7. But the user needs to be in Madrid on day 2-3. Conflict. So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm. This is really tough. Let's think of the direct flight connections again.\n\nCities and their direct flights:\n\nMadrid connects to London, Oslo, Berlin, Dublin.\n\nBerlin connects to Vilnius, Madrid, London, Oslo, Dublin.\n\nOslo connects to Vilnius, Madrid, London, Berlin, Dublin.\n\nDublin connects to Madrid, London, Berlin, Oslo.\n\nLondon connects to Madrid, Oslo, Berlin, Dublin.\n\nVilnius connects to Oslo and Berlin.\n\nSo the key is to find a path that includes all 6 cities with the required days, using direct flights.\n\nLet me try to sketch a possible route:\n\n1. Start in London (days 1-2)\n\n2. Fly to Madrid (day 2). Madrid days 2-3.\n\n3. Fly to Berlin (day 3). Berlin days 3-7.\n\n4. Fly to Dublin (day 7). Dublin days 7-9.\n\n5. Fly to Oslo (day 9). Oslo days 9-11.\n\n6. Fly to Vilnius (day 11). Vilnius days 11-13.\n\nCheck if this works:\n\n- London: days 1-2 (2 days)\n\n- Madrid: days 2-3 (2 days)\n\n- Berlin: days 3-7 (5 days)\n\n- Dublin: days 7-9 (3 days)\n\n- Oslo: days 9-11 (3 days) (flight from Dublin to Oslo on day 9)\n\n- Vilnius: days 11-13 (3 days) (flight from Oslo to Vilnius on day 11)\n\nTotal days: 13.\n\nCheck overlaps:\n\n- Day 2: London and Madrid\n\n- Day 3: Madrid and Berlin\n\n- Day 7: Berlin and Dublin\n\n- Day 9: Dublin and Oslo\n\n- Day 11: Oslo and Vilnius\n\nNow, check if all direct flights exist:\n\n- London to Madrid: yes.\n\n- Madrid to Berlin: yes.\n\n- Berlin to Dublin: yes.\n\n- Dublin to Oslo: yes.\n\n- Oslo to Vilnius: yes.\n\nThis fits all direct flight requirements.\n\nNow, check the required days:\n\n- London: 2 days (days 1-2)\n\n- Madrid: 2 days (days 2-3)\n\n- Berlin: 5 days (days 3-7)\n\n- Dublin: 3 days (days 7-9)\n\n- Oslo: 3 days (days 9-11)\n\n- Vilnius: 3 days (days 11-13)\n\nYes, each city has the required number of days, and the total is 13 days.\n\nThis seems to work!\n\nNow, let's verify the constraints:\n\n- Dublin between days 7-9: yes, days 7-9.\n\n- Madrid relatives between days 2-3: yes.\n\n- Berlin wedding days 3-7: yes.\n\n- All other cities have the required days.\n\nYes, this meets all constraints.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\nDay 1-2: London\n\nDay 2-3: Madrid\n\nDay 3-7: Berlin\n\nDay 7-9: Dublin\n\nDay 9-11: Oslo\n\nDay 11-13: Vilnius\n\nEach segment uses direct flights, and the day ranges overlap correctly to fit within 13 days.",
