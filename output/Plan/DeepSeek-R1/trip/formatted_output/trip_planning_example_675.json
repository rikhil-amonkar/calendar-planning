            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user wants a 16-day trip visiting 6 European cities: Dubrovnik, Split, Milan, Porto, Krakow, and Munich. Each city has specific days they need to stay. Also, there are some events on certain days that must be considered. Let me break down the requirements first.\n\nDubrovnik: 4 days.\nSplit: 3 days.\nMilan: 3 days, with a wedding between days 11-13.\nPorto: 4 days.\nKrakow: 2 days, and meet friends there on days 8-9.\nMunich: 5 days, with an annual show from day 4 to 8.\n\nWait, the Munich show is from day 4 to 8. That's 5 days (days 4,5,6,7,8). But they want to stay in Munich for 5 days. So that fits. So days 4-8 must be in Munich. But they also need to be in Krakow on days 8-9. So after Munich, they go to Krakow. But how? Let me check the direct flights. The direct flights include Munich-Krakow. Yes, so after Munich, they can fly to Krakow on day 8. But day 8 is part of both Munich and Krakow? Because the user mentioned that if you fly from A to B on day X, you're in both cities on day X. So day 8 would be the last day in Munich and the first day in Krakow. Wait, the Munich event is up to day 8, so they need to be in Munich until day 8. Then on day 8, they fly to Krakow. So Krakow days would be 8-9. Because day 8 is arrival, day 9 is the next day, but they need to meet friends between 8-9. So days 8 and 9 in Krakow. Then they have to leave Krakow on day 10 maybe.\n\nNext, they have to go to Milan for the wedding on days 11-13. So Milan needs to be days 11-13. But they also need 3 days in Milan. Wait, days 11-13 is three days (11,12,13). So that's okay. So the Milan stay would be days 11-13.\n\nPorto needs 4 days. Let's see where to fit that. Also, Split needs 3 days, Dubrovnik 4 days.\n\nLet me start building the itinerary step by step.\n\nFirst, the user starts in Dubrovnik for 4 days. Let's say days 1-4. Then, from Dubrovnik, they need to fly to another city. Direct flights from Dubrovnik are only to Munich (as per the given list). So after Dubrovnik, they go to Munich. But Munich's event is from day 4 to 8. Wait, days 1-4 in Dubrovnik. Then day 4 is the flight day to Munich. So day 4 would be in both Dubrovnik and Munich. But the Munich event starts on day 4. So Munich days would be 4-8. That works because the event is days 4-8. So Munich is days 4-8. Then on day 8, fly to Krakow. Krakow days 8-9. Then days 8-9 in Krakow. Then from Krakow, they need to go to Split? Because Split needs 3 days. Let's see the direct flights from Krakow: Split, Milan, Munich. So possible. If they go from Krakow to Split, that's a direct flight. Split needs 3 days. So days 10-12 in Split? Wait, but Milan's wedding is days 11-13. So Split would overlap with Milan. That's a problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, after Krakow (days 8-9), maybe go to Split next. So days 10-12 in Split. Then from Split, fly to Milan (direct flight exists) for the wedding on days 11-13. Wait, but days 10-12 in Split would end on day 12. Then Milan needs to start on day 11. That's overlapping. So that's not possible. So this approach may not work.\n\nWait, maybe the order needs adjustment. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: Start in Porto? No, the user didn't specify starting point, but the cities are Dubrovnik, Split, Milan, Porto, Krakow, Munich. Let's think of possible sequences considering direct flights.\n\nDubrovnik (4 days) \u2192 Munich (5 days, days 4-8) \u2192 Krakow (2 days, 8-9) \u2192 Split (3 days, days 10-12) \u2192 Milan (3 days, 13-15) \u2192 Porto (4 days, days 15-18) \u2192 but total days would exceed 16. Wait, no. Let's calculate:\n\nDubrovnik: 1-4 (4 days)\nMunich: 4-8 (5 days, days 4,5,6,7,8)\nKrakow: 8-9 (2 days)\nSplit: 10-12 (3 days)\nMilan: 13-15 (3 days)\nPorto: 16-19? No, that's over. Wait, total days must be 16. Let's count:\n\nDays 1-4: Dubrovnik (4)\nDays 4-8: Munich (5)\nDays 8-9: Krakow (2)\nDays 10-12: Split (3)\nDays 13-15: Milan (3)\nDays 16-16: Porto? Only one day. But Porto needs 4 days. This approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative: After Milan, go to Porto. Direct flights from Milan to Porto exist. So Milan days 11-13 (wedding). Then Porto days 14-17 (4 days). But total days would be 17, which is over.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think again.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- Munich must be days 4-8.\n\n- Krakow must include days 8-9.\n\n- Milan wedding is days 11-13, which must be in Milan.\n\nSo after Munich (days 4-8), on day 8 fly to Krakow (direct flight available). So Krakow days 8-9. Then, from Krakow, possible flights are to Split, Milan, or Munich. But Munich is already done. So Split or Milan.\n\nIf go to Split after Krakow (days 10-12), then Split is 3 days. Then from Split, fly to Milan (direct flight exists). Milan needs to be days 11-13. Wait, days 10-12 in Split would end on day 12. Then Milan would start on day 12 (as flight day), but the wedding is days 11-13. So overlapping. That's a problem. Because the user needs to be in Milan from day 11. So that approach won't work.\n\nAlternative: After Krakow (days 8-9), fly to Milan. But Milan's wedding is days 11-13. So if Milan is days 10-12 (3 days), but wedding is days 11-13. That's not aligning. Wait, the wedding is between day 11 and 13, so they need to be in Milan during those days. So Milan must include days 11,12,13. So the Milan stay must be at least from day 11 to day 13. But they need 3 days in Milan. So days 11-13 (3 days). Then, after Milan, go to Split? But Split needs 3 days. Let's see:\n\nIf Milan is days 11-13, then Split would be days 14-16 (3 days). But the total days would be 16. Then Porto's 4 days are not accounted for. So this is an issue.\n\nWait, the user also needs to visit Porto for 4 days. So where to fit that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is different. Let's try:\n\nStart in Porto (4 days: days 1-4). Then fly to Milan (direct flight exists). But no, because the user has to attend a wedding in Milan days 11-13. So Milan has to be later. Not sure. Let's think again.\n\nAnother approach:\n\nDubrovnik first (4 days: 1-4)\n\nThen Munich (4-8: 5 days)\n\nThen Krakow (8-9: 2 days)\n\nThen Split (10-12: 3 days)\n\nThen Milan (13-15: 3 days, wedding 11-13? No, that's overlapping. Wait, Milan's wedding is between day 11-13. So Milan must include days 11,12,13. So if Split is days 10-12, then on day 12, fly to Milan (direct flight). Then Milan days 12-14 (3 days). But the wedding is days 11-13, so days 12 and 13 would be covered. But day 11 would be in Split. That's a problem. So the user needs to be in Milan from day 11.\n\nAlternative: After Krakow (days 8-9), fly to Milan on day 10. Then Milan days 10-12 (3 days). But the wedding is days 11-13. So days 10-12 would include days 11 and 12, but miss day 13. Then the wedding is on day 13 as well. So Milan needs to be days 11-13. How?\n\nMaybe:\n\nDubrovnik: 1-4\n\nMunich: 4-8\n\nKrakow: 8-9\n\nMilan: 10-12 (3 days, but wedding is 11-13. Not enough.)\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let's consider the constraints again:\n\n- The wedding in Milan is between day 11-13. So the user must be in Milan on those days. So Milan's itinerary must include days 11,12,13.\n\n- Milan needs 3 days. So days 11-13 (3 days: 11,12,13).\n\nSo after that, they can go to Porto. But Porto needs 4 days. Days 14-17 would be 4 days, but total trip is 16 days. So days 14-17 is 4 days (14,15,16,17) but that's over 16. So maybe days 13-16? But that would be 4 days. Wait, day 13 is in Milan (last day), then fly to Porto on day 13. So day 13 is both Milan and Porto. Then Porto days 13-16 (4 days: 13,14,15,16). That works. Then total days would be 16.\n\nSo let's outline:\n\nDubrovnik: 1-4 (4 days)\n\nMunich: 4-8 (5 days)\n\nKrakow: 8-9 (2 days)\n\nSplit: 10-12 (3 days)\n\nMilan: 11-13 (3 days) \u2192 but wait, Split is 10-12, which overlaps with Milan 11-13. That's impossible. The user can't be in two places at once.\n\nAh, here's the problem. If Split is days 10-12 and Milan is 11-13, there's an overlap. So that's not allowed. So need to adjust.\n\nAlternative: After Krakow (8-9), go to Milan for the wedding (11-13), but how?\n\nWait, days 8-9: Krakow. Then day 10: travel to Split? Then Split 10-12 (3 days). But Milan needs to be 11-13. So conflict.\n\nAlternatively, after Krakow (8-9), fly to Milan on day 10. But Milan needs to be 11-13. So Milan days 10-12 would be 3 days, but the wedding is 11-13. So days 11 and 12 are covered, but day 13 is not. So they need to be in Milan until day 13. So maybe Milan is days 11-13. But how to get there from Krakow.\n\nFrom Krakow, direct flights to Milan exist. So on day 10, fly from Krakow to Milan. Then Milan days 10-12. But that's 3 days (10,11,12). Then the wedding is days 11-13. So days 11 and 12 are covered, but day 13 is missing. So the user needs to be in Milan until day 13. So Milan should be days 11-13. But how to fit that.\n\nAlternatively, after Krakow (8-9), go to Split for 3 days (10-12), then fly to Milan on day 12. Then Milan days 12-14. But wedding is 11-13. So days 12 and 13 are covered. But day 11 is in Split. Not good.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let's try a different route.\n\nWhat if after Munich (4-8), instead of going to Krakow next, we go to Split first? But the user needs to meet friends in Krakow on days 8-9. So days 8-9 must be in Krakow. So after Munich (4-8), on day 8 fly to Krakow. Then days 8-9 in Krakow.\n\nThen from Krakow, possible direct flights are Split, Milan, Munich. So after Krakow (days 8-9), the next destination must be Split or Milan.\n\nIf we go to Split next (days 10-12), then Milan needs to be days 11-13. But Split is days 10-12, which overlaps with Milan days 11-13. So conflict.\n\nAlternatively, go from Krakow to Milan on day 10. Then Milan days 10-12 (3 days), but wedding is 11-13. So days 10-12 would include 11 and 12, but miss day 13. Then need to extend Milan to day 13. So days 10-13 (4 days), but user only wants 3 days in Milan. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, after Krakow (days 8-9), go to Milan on day 10. Then Milan days 10-12 (3 days), but the wedding is 11-13. So days 10-12: wedding on 11 and 12, but day 13 is not covered. The user needs to be there on day 13 as well. So that's an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the wedding is between day 11 and day 13, inclusive. So days 11,12,13. So Milan needs to include those days. So the Milan stay must be at least days 11-13. So how to get there.\n\nAfter Krakow (days 8-9), on day 10, travel to Split (days 10-12). Then from Split, fly to Milan on day 12. Then Milan days 12-14 (3 days). But the wedding is days 11-13. So days 12 and 13 are covered, but day 11 is in Split. Not good.\n\nAlternative: From Krakow (days 8-9), fly to Milan on day 9. Then Milan days 9-11 (3 days). But the wedding is days 11-13. So days 9-11 would end on day 11. Then the wedding starts on day 11. Maybe they can stay longer. But user wants 3 days in Milan. If they stay days 11-13 (3 days), that works. But how to get there.\n\nWait, if after Krakow (days 8-9), on day 9 fly to Milan. Then Milan days 9-11 (3 days). But the wedding is days 11-13. So they would miss days 12 and 13. So that's not acceptable.\n\nThis is getting really complex. Let's try to outline the days step by step:\n\nTotal days: 16\n\nCities and required days:\n\n- Dubrovnik: 4\n\n- Split: 3\n\n- Milan: 3 (wedding 11-13)\n\n- Porto: 4\n\n- Krakow: 2 (meet friends 8-9)\n\n- Munich: 5 (show days 4-8)\n\nDirect flights:\n\nLooking for possible connections between cities in the order that satisfies all constraints.\n\nStart with Dubrovnik (4 days: 1-4)\n\nThen Munich (days 4-8)\n\nThen Krakow (days 8-9)\n\nNow, from Krakow, possible next cities: Split, Milan, Munich. Munich is done.\n\nIf go to Split next: days 10-12. Then Milan must be days 11-13. Conflict. Overlap.\n\nIf go to Milan next: days 10-12. Then wedding is 11-13. Conflict.\n\nAlternative: After Krakow (days 8-9), fly to Milan on day 10. Stay days 10-12. But wedding is 11-13. So days 10-12 in Milan would include days 11 and 12. Then on day 13, need to be in Milan. So extend Milan to day 13. But that's 4 days (10-13), but user only wants 3. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, from Krakow, fly to Split on day 10. Split days 10-12. Then fly to Milan on day 12. Milan days 12-14. But wedding is 11-13. So days 12 and 13 in Milan. But day 11 is in Split. Not acceptable.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the issue is that Split and Milan are overlapping with the wedding dates. Maybe the order needs to be adjusted. Let's try a different sequence.\n\nAfter Munich (days 4-8), go to Krakow (days 8-9). Then from Krakow, fly to Milan on day 10. Milan days 10-12. But wedding is 11-13. So days 10-12 would include days 11 and 12. Then day 13 is missing. So extend Milan to day 13. But that's 4 days. User wants 3. So can't.\n\nAlternatively, fly from Krakow to Milan on day 9. Then Milan days 9-11 (3 days). Wedding is 11-13. So days 9-11 would end on day 11. Then day 11 is the start of the wedding. Maybe they can stay in Milan from day 11-13. But that's only 3 days, which matches. So Milan days 11-13 (3 days). But how to get from Krakow to Milan by day 11. So days 8-9 in Krakow. Then day 10: travel to Milan? But that would require day 10 to be in transit. But according to the user's note, flying on day X means being in both cities on day X. So if they fly from Krakow to Milan on day 10, then day 10 is in both Krakow and Milan. Then Milan days 10-12 (3 days). But the wedding is days 11-13. So days 10-12 would cover days 11 and 12. Then day 13 is missing. So need to be in Milan on day 13. So extend to day 13. That's 4 days. Conflict.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe Split is after Milan. Let's see.\n\nAfter Milan (days 11-13), go to Split. But Split needs 3 days. Days 14-16 would be 3 days. Then Porto needs 4 days, but that's beyond 16 days. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, after Milan, go to Porto. Porto needs 4 days. Days 14-17. Over the 16-day limit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the user needs to adjust their plans, but we have to make it fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can stay in Milan days 11-13 (3 days), then fly to Porto on day 13. So day 13 is in both Milan and Porto. Then Porto days 13-16 (4 days). That works. Then total days would be 16.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nDubrovnik: 1-4\n\nMunich: 4-8\n\nKrakow: 8-9\n\nSplit: 10-12 (3 days)\n\nMilan: 11-13 (3 days) \u2192 but Split is 10-12 and Milan 11-13: overlapping. Not possible.\n\nAlternative, after Krakow (8-9), go to Split on day 10. Split 10-12. Then fly to Milan on day 12. Milan 12-14 (3 days). But wedding is 11-13. So days 12 and 13 in Milan. Day 11 is in Split. Not allowed.\n\nAnother idea: Skip Split after Krakow and go directly to Milan.\n\nDubrovnik: 1-4\n\nMunich:4-8\n\nKrakow:8-9\n\nMilan:10-12 (3 days, but wedding is 11-13. So days 10-12 would cover 11 and 12, missing day 13. Then need to extend to day 13. So Milan 10-13 (4 days). But user wants 3 days. Conflict.\n\nAlternatively, have Milan days 11-13 (3 days), which requires arriving on day 11. So from Krakow, fly to Milan on day 10. Then day 10 is in both Krakow and Milan. So Milan days 10-12 (3 days). But again, missing day 13.\n\nThis is a dead end. Perhaps the problem is in the initial sequence. Let's try a different starting city.\n\nWhat if the trip starts in Porto? Porto needs 4 days. Days 1-4. Then fly to Milan (direct flight exists). Milan days 5-7. But the wedding is days 11-13. Can't be. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see which cities have connections to Porto. Direct flights from Porto are Munich, Milan. So after Porto, can go to Munich or Milan.\n\nBut the user needs to be in Munich for the show days 4-8. So maybe start with Porto days 1-4, then fly to Munich on day 4. Munich days 4-8. Then proceed. But then Dubrovnik needs 4 days. When to fit that?\n\nThis might not be the best approach.\n\nAlternative:\n\nDubrovnik: days 1-4\n\nMunich:4-8\n\nKrakow:8-9\n\nSplit:10-12\n\nMilan:13-15 (3 days, but wedding is 11-13. So conflict.)\n\nNo.\n\nWait, the user must attend the wedding in Milan between days 11-13. So Milan must be days 11-13. Let's try:\n\nDubrovnik:1-4\n\nMunich:4-8\n\nKrakow:8-9\n\nMilan:10-12 (3 days). Wedding days 11-13. Not enough.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: Include Split before Munich.\n\nDubrovnik:1-4\n\nSplit:5-7 (3 days). But Munich's show is days 4-8. So days 5-7 would conflict with Munich days 4-8. Not possible.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nStart in Split. But no, user wants to stay in Dubrovnik first.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let's try to list all possible direct flight connections to see possible routes.\n\nCities:\n\nDubrovnik, Split, Milan, Porto, Krakow, Munich.\n\nDirect flights:\n\n- Munich-Porto\n\n- Split-Milan\n\n- Milan-Porto\n\n- Munich-Krakow\n\n- Munich-Milan\n\n- Dubrovnik-Munich\n\n- Krakow-Split\n\n- Krakow-Milan\n\n- Munich-Split\n\nSo possible routes from Dubrovnik: only to Munich.\n\nFrom Munich, can go to Porto, Krakow, Milan, Split, Dubrovnik.\n\nFrom Krakow, can go to Split, Milan, Munich.\n\nFrom Split, can go to Krakow, Milan, Munich.\n\nFrom Milan, can go to Split, Porto, Munich, Krakow.\n\nFrom Porto, can go to Munich, Milan.\n\nSo after Dubrovnik (days 1-4), must go to Munich (days 4-8). Then Munich to Krakow (days 8-9). From Krakow, possible to Split, Milan, or Munich. But Munich is done.\n\nIf from Krakow to Split: days 10-12.\n\nFrom Split, can go to Milan (days 13-15), but wedding is 11-13. Conflict.\n\nAlternatively, from Split to Milan on day 12. Milan days 12-14. Wedding days 11-13. Overlapping days 12-13.\n\nBut days 11-13 in Milan are required. So how to reach Milan by day 11.\n\nFrom Krakow (days 8-9), fly to Milan on day 10. Milan days 10-12. Wedding days 11-13. So days 10-12 in Milan covers days 11 and 12. Misses day 13. Then need to extend to day 13. So Milan days 10-13 (4 days). But user wants 3 days. Conflict.\n\nAlternatively, arrive in Milan on day 11. So from Krakow (days 8-9), fly to Milan on day 10. Day 10 is travel day (Krakow and Milan). Then Milan days 10-12 (3 days). Wedding days 11-13. So days 10-12 in Milan: days 10,11,12. But wedding is days 11-13. So days 11 and 12 are covered, but day 13 is not. User needs to be in Milan on day 13 as well. So maybe they have to stay until day 13. That's 4 days (10-13). But user wants 3 days. So this is a problem.\n\nIs there any way to fit Milan days 11-13 with 3 days and no overlap?\n\nYes. If Milan is days 11-13 (3 days). So arrival on day 11, stay until day 13. But how to get there from previous city.\n\nPrevious city would be Krakow (days 8-9), then need to go to Split for 3 days. Split days 10-12. Then fly to Milan on day 12. So Milan days 12-14. But wedding is days 11-13. So days 12 and 13 covered. Day 11 is in Split. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, after Krakow (8-9), fly to Milan on day 9. Then Milan days 9-11 (3 days). But wedding is 11-13. So day 11 is covered, but days 12 and 13 are missed.\n\nThis seems impossible. Perhaps the user's constraints can't be met without overlapping or exceeding days. But the assistant must find a way.\n\nWait, what if we adjust the order of cities after Munich:\n\nDubrovnik:1-4\n\nMunich:4-8\n\nKrakow:8-9\n\nThen fly to Milan on day 9. So day 9: Krakow and Milan.\n\nMilan days 9-11 (3 days). But the wedding is days 11-13. So days 9-11 would include day 11. Then they need to stay in Milan until day 13. So days 9-13 (5 days). But user wants 3 days in Milan. Conflict.\n\nAlternatively, Milan days 11-13. How to get there:\n\nFrom Krakow (days 8-9), fly to Split on day 10. Split days 10-12. Then fly to Milan on day 12. Milan days 12-14 (3 days). Wedding days 11-13. Days 12-14 would include days 12 and 13. But day 11 is in Split. Not allowed.\n\nThis is really impossible. The only way to have Milan days 11-13 is if they arrive in Milan on day 11. So previous city must be such that they can fly to Milan on day 11.\n\nPossible previous cities with direct flights to Milan: Split, Krakow, Munich, Porto.\n\nIf the previous city is Split, then Split days would need to end on day 10. So Split days 8-10 (3 days). But user needs to be in Krakow days 8-9. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, previous city is Krakow. So from Krakow (days 8-9), fly to Milan on day 10. Then Milan days 10-12 (3 days). Wedding days 11-13. Days 10-12 would include days 11 and 12. Day 13 is missing. So user can't attend day 13 of the wedding.\n\nThis is a dead end. Maybe the user's constraints are impossible. But according to the problem statement, there is a solution. So I must have missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can be in Milan for days 11-13 even if they arrive on day 11. So days 11-13 is three days (11,12,13). That works. So how to reach Milan on day 11.\n\nPrevious city would need to be such that they can fly to Milan on day 11. So previous city must be connected to Milan and allow arrival on day 11.\n\nPossible previous cities: Split, Krakow, Munich, Porto.\n\nIf the previous city is Split, then Split must end on day 10. So Split days 8-10 (3 days). But user is in Krakow days 8-9. Can't be in Split days 8-10.\n\nAlternatively, after Krakow (days 8-9), fly to Split on day 9. Then Split days 9-11 (3 days). Then fly to Milan on day 11. Milan days 11-13 (3 days). But Split days 9-11 would require day 9 to be both Krakow and Split. So Split days 9-11 (days 9,10,11). Then on day 11, fly to Milan. Milan days 11-13 (days 11,12,13). That works.\n\nLet's check:\n\nDubrovnik:1-4\n\nMunich:4-8\n\nKrakow:8-9\n\nSplit:9-11 (3 days)\n\nMilan:11-13 (3 days)\n\nPorto:14-17 (4 days) \u2192 but total days would be 17. Over.\n\nBut total days must be 16. So Porto days 14-17 is 4 days (14,15,16,17), but day 17 is beyond 16.\n\nSo need to adjust Porto to days 14-17, but that's 4 days within the 16-day limit. Wait, day 14-17 is 4 days: 14,15,16,17. But the trip is 16 days, so day 17 is out. So this is impossible.\n\nAlternative: Porto days 13-16. How?\n\nFrom Milan (11-13), fly to Porto on day 13. So day 13 is both Milan and Porto. Then Porto days 13-16 (4 days: 13,14,15,16). That fits within 16 days.\n\nYes! So let's outline:\n\n- Dubrovnik:1-4\n\n- Munich:4-8\n\n- Krakow:8-9\n\n- Split:9-11 (3 days: 9,10,11)\n\n- Milan:11-13 (3 days: 11,12,13)\n\n- Porto:13-16 (4 days: 13,14,15,16)\n\nTotal days: 16.\n\nCheck if all direct flights are available:\n\n- Dubrovnik to Munich: yes.\n\n- Munich to Krakow: yes.\n\n- Krakow to Split: yes (direct flight exists).\n\n- Split to Milan: yes.\n\n- Milan to Porto: yes.\n\nThis works.\n\nNow, check all required days:\n\n- Dubrovnik: 4 days (1-4)\n\n- Munich: 5 days (4-8)\n\n- Krakow: 2 days (8-9)\n\n- Split: 3 days (9-11)\n\n- Milan: 3 days (11-13)\n\n- Porto: 4 days (13-16)\n\nWedding in Milan days 11-13: covered.\n\nMeet friends in Krakow days 8-9: covered.\n\nMunich show days 4-8: covered.\n\nAll cities visited, days fit, and direct flights available.\n\nYes, this seems to work.",
