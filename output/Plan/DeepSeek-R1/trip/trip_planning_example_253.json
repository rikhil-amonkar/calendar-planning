            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a 14-day trip visiting 4 cities: Amsterdam, Vienna, Santorini, and Lyon. The constraints are specific days for workshops and weddings, along with the number of days in each city. Also, direct flights are only between certain cities. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user must spend 3 days in Amsterdam, with the workshop between days 9-11. So Amsterdam has to include those days. Then, they need 7 days in Vienna, 4 in Santorini, and 3 in Lyon. The wedding in Lyon is days 7-9. Wait, but the wedding is in Lyon, which is 3 days. So Lyon must cover days 7-9. But the user wants to spend 3 days there, which aligns with the wedding dates. So Lyon is days 7-9.\n\nNow, the total days: 7 (Vienna) + 3 (Amsterdam) + 4 (Santorini) + 3 (Lyon) = 17 days. Wait, that's over 14. Oh, wait, maybe the days overlap when flying. Because when you fly from A to B on day X, you count that day in both cities. So we need to adjust for that. Let's recalculate considering that.\n\nLet me start by placing the fixed events. The wedding in Lyon is days 7-9. So Lyon must be days 7-9. Then the workshop in Amsterdam is days 9-11. Wait, but the user is in Lyon until day 9. So on day 9, they have to be in both Lyon and Amsterdam? Because they fly on day 9. So Lyon days 7-9 (inclusive), and Amsterdam starts on day 9. So Amsterdam would be days 9-11, but since day 9 is a travel day, that counts as a day in both cities. So Amsterdam's 3 days would be days 9,10,11. Then Lyon's 3 days are days 7,8,9. That's overlapping on day 9. So total days used so far: Lyon (3 days), Amsterdam (3 days), but day 9 is counted for both. Then we have Vienna (7 days) and Santorini (4 days). Let's see how to fit all into 14 days.\n\nWait, let's outline the days:\n\nTotal days: 14. Let's start from day 1 to day 14.\n\nThe user needs to be in Lyon from day 7-9 (wedding). So Lyon is days 7,8,9. Then Amsterdam from day 9-11 (workshop). So days 9,10,11. But day 9 is counted for both Lyon and Amsterdam. So Lyon: 3 days (7-9), Amsterdam: 3 days (9-11). That uses days 7-11, but days 9 is overlapping. Now, the user also needs to spend 7 days in Vienna and 4 in Santorini. Let's see the remaining days.\n\nBefore Lyon (days 1-6): need to fit Vienna and Santorini. Wait, but maybe the order is different. Let's think about possible routes with direct flights.\n\nThe direct flights are between:\n\n- Vienna and Lyon\n\n- Vienna and Santorini\n\n- Vienna and Amsterdam\n\n- Amsterdam and Santorini\n\n- Lyon and Amsterdam\n\nSo possible routes. Let's consider the order of cities.\n\nSince the user has to be in Lyon on days 7-9 and Amsterdam on days 9-11, the trip must go from Lyon to Amsterdam on day 9. But since Lyon and Amsterdam have a direct flight, that's possible.\n\nNow, before Lyon (days 1-6), where can the user be? Let's say they start in Vienna. Vienna has direct flights to Lyon, Santorini, and Amsterdam. So maybe start in Vienna, spend some days, then go to Santorini, then Lyon. But need to check the days.\n\nAlternatively, start in Santorini, then Vienna, then Lyon, then Amsterdam. But need to fit the days.\n\nWait, the user wants to spend 7 days in Vienna. So that's a big chunk. Let's see:\n\nIf the user starts in Vienna for 7 days, days 1-7. Then fly to Lyon on day 7. But day 7 is the start of Lyon's wedding days (7-9). But flying on day 7 would mean they are in both Vienna and Lyon on day 7. So Vienna would be days 1-7 (including day 7), which is 7 days. Then Lyon days 7-9 (3 days). Then Amsterdam days 9-11 (3 days). Then Santorini days 11-14 (4 days, days 11,12,13,14). But Santorini needs to be connected via direct flight from Amsterdam, which is possible. Let's check the total days:\n\nVienna: 7 days (1-7)\n\nLyon: 3 days (7-9)\n\nAmsterdam: 3 days (9-11)\n\nSantorini: 4 days (11-14)\n\nTotal days: 14. Each transition uses a direct flight. Let's verify:\n\nVienna to Lyon: direct flight exists. Then Lyon to Amsterdam: direct. Amsterdam to Santorini: direct. That works. But wait, the user wants to spend 3 days in Amsterdam, which would be days 9,10,11 (3 days). Then Santorini from 11-14 (4 days). That adds up. Let's check the counts:\n\nVienna: days 1-7 (7 days, correct)\n\nLyon: days 7-9 (3 days, correct)\n\nAmsterdam: days 9-11 (3 days, correct)\n\nSantorini: days 11-14 (4 days, correct)\n\nTotal days: 14. All constraints met. The workshop in Amsterdam is days 9-11, which is covered. The wedding in Lyon days 7-9. The days in each city are correct. Direct flights between each transition (Vienna-Lyon, Lyon-Amsterdam, Amsterdam-Santorini). Yes, this seems to work.\n\nAnother possible route could be starting in Santorini, but that might not fit. Let's see. Suppose Santorini first: 4 days (1-4), then Vienna 7 days (4-10), but then Lyon days 10-12 (but the wedding is days 7-9, which conflicts). So that's not possible. So the initial plan seems correct.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\nVienna: Days 1-7\n\nLyon: Days 7-9\n\nAmsterdam: Days 9-11\n\nSantorini: Days 11-14\n\nEach segment uses direct flights. Checking the direct flight connections:\n\nVienna to Lyon: yes.\n\nLyon to Amsterdam: yes.\n\nAmsterdam to Santorini: yes.\n\nYes, all transitions are allowed.",
