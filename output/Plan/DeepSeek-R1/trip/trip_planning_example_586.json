            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. The user wants to visit 5 European cities in 12 days, using only direct flights. The cities are Frankfurt (3 days), Naples (4 days), Helsinki (4 days), Lyon (3 days), and Prague (2 days). They also have specific events: a workshop in Prague from day 1-2 and an annual show in Helsinki from day 2-5. The direct flight connections are given, so I need to make sure the itinerary uses those.\n\nFirst, let's list the constraints:\n\n1. Prague must be visited on days 1-2 because of the workshop. So days 1 and 2 are in Prague. But wait, the workshop is between day 1 and day 2. Does that mean they need to be in Prague on both days? Probably, since if you attend a workshop that spans two days, you're there for both. So Prague is 2 days: days 1 and 2.\n\n2. Helsinki has an annual show from day 2 to day 5. Wait, that's days 2-5 inclusive? So they need to be in Helsinki during those days. But wait, the user is in Prague on day 2. So how does that work? Because the show is from day 2 to day 5, but they have to be in Prague on day 2. Hmm, maybe the flight from Prague to Helsinki happens on day 2. Since flights take a day but you can be in both cities on the same day. So if you fly from Prague to Helsinki on day 2, you spend day 2 in both cities. That way, Helsinki days would start on day 2. So days 2-5 would be Helsinki, but day 2 is split between Prague and Helsinki. But according to the problem statement, if you fly on day X from A to B, you are in both cities on day X, contributing to the count for each. So for Helsinki, the 4 days would include day 2 (since they arrive there on day 2). But the user needs to spend 4 days in Helsinki. So days 2,3,4,5? That's four days. Then, the show is from day 2-5, which matches. So that works.\n\nBut wait, the user is in Prague on day 1 and 2 (workshop days 1-2). Then on day 2, they fly to Helsinki, arriving there on day 2. So Helsinki days would be 2-5 (4 days). Then after Helsinki, where do they go? The next city must be connected via direct flight. From Helsinki, direct flights are to Naples and Frankfurt. The user needs to spend 4 days in Naples. Let's see. After Helsinki (days 2-5), next is day 6. So days 6-9 would be Naples (4 days). Then from Naples, direct flights are to Helsinki and Frankfurt. So from Naples to Frankfurt. Then Frankfurt is 3 days (days 10-12). Wait, but Frankfurt needs 3 days. Days 10-12 is 3 days. Then after Frankfurt, the user needs to go to Lyon for 3 days. But wait, the total days would be:\n\nPrague: 2 days (1-2)\n\nHelsinki: 4 days (2-5) \u2192 but day 2 is shared with Prague.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the user wants to spend 4 days in Helsinki. So the days in Helsinki must sum to 4. If day 2 is split between Prague and Helsinki, that counts as 1 day in Helsinki. Then days 3,4,5 would be full days, making 4 days total. So Helsinki is days 2-5 (4 days). Then Naples is next. From Helsinki to Naples is a direct flight. So they can fly on day 5 to Naples, arriving on day 5. But day 5 is already part of Helsinki. So Naples would start on day 5? Wait, no. If they fly on day 5 from Helsinki to Naples, they are in both cities on day 5. So Naples gets day 5 as part of their stay. But the user needs 4 days in Naples. So days 5-8 (4 days: 5,6,7,8). Then from Naples, they can fly to Frankfurt (direct flight exists). Frankfurt requires 3 days. So days 9-11 (3 days: 9,10,11). Then from Frankfurt, they can go to Lyon (direct flight exists). Lyon needs 3 days. But the total days so far are 11. The trip is 12 days. So Lyon would be days 12-14, but that's beyond the 12-day limit. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nStart with Prague: days 1-2 (2 days)\n\nHelsinki: days 2-5 (4 days, including day 2)\n\nThen Naples: days 5-8 (4 days, including day 5)\n\nFrankfurt: days 8-10 (3 days: 8,9,10) \u2192 but that's 3 days?\n\nWait, days 8-10 is three days (8,9,10). Then Lyon needs 3 days. Days 11-13, but that's over 12 days. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the order needs to be adjusted. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative route:\n\nPrague (2 days: 1-2)\n\nHelsinki (4 days: 2-5)\n\nThen from Helsinki, fly to Frankfurt (direct flight exists). Frankfurt needs 3 days. So days 5-7 (but day 5 is in Helsinki and Frankfurt). Wait, if you fly from Helsinki to Frankfurt on day 5, you're in both cities on day 5. So Frankfurt would have days 5-7 (3 days: 5,6,7). Then from Frankfurt, direct flights to Lyon. Lyon needs 3 days: days 8-10 (3 days). Then from Lyon, can we get to Naples? Direct flights from Lyon to Naples? According to the given list, no. The direct flights are Prague-Lyon, Prague-Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Lyon, Helsinki-Naples, Helsinki-Frankfurt, Naples-Frankfurt, Prague-Helsinki. So from Lyon, the only direct flights are to Prague and Frankfurt. So after Lyon, to get to Naples, they need to go through Frankfurt. So from Lyon, fly to Frankfurt (day 10), then Frankfurt to Naples (direct flight exists). But Frankfurt already had 3 days (5-7). Wait, but the user needs to spend 3 days in Frankfurt. If they go back to Frankfurt after Lyon, that would add more days. So maybe that's not feasible. Let's try:\n\nPrague (1-2)\n\nHelsinki (2-5)\n\nFrankfurt (5-7) \u2192 3 days (5,6,7). Then from Frankfurt to Naples (direct flight). Naples needs 4 days: days 7-10 (but day 7 is in Frankfurt and Naples). So Naples days 7-10 (4 days). Then from Naples, next city? The remaining city is Lyon. Direct flights from Naples are to Helsinki and Frankfurt. So can't fly directly to Lyon. So from Naples, need to go to Frankfurt again (day 10), then Frankfurt to Lyon (direct flight). Lyon needs 3 days. Days 10-12 (3 days: 10,11,12). But Frankfurt would have days 5-7 and day 10. But the user only wants 3 days in Frankfurt. So days 5-7 (3 days) and day 10 would be an extra. That's a problem. So this route doesn't work.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nAfter Helsinki (days 2-5), fly to Naples (direct flight). Naples 4 days: days 5-8 (including day 5). Then from Naples to Frankfurt (direct flight). Frankfurt 3 days: days 8-10 (8,9,10). Then Frankfurt to Lyon (direct flight). Lyon 3 days: days 10-12 (10,11,12). But day 10 is split between Frankfurt and Lyon. So Lyon would have 3 days: 10,11,12. That works. Let's check the counts:\n\nPrague: days 1-2 \u2192 2 days (correct)\n\nHelsinki: days 2-5 \u2192 4 days (days 2,3,4,5)\n\nNaples: days 5-8 \u2192 4 days (5,6,7,8)\n\nFrankfurt: days 8-10 \u2192 3 days (8,9,10)\n\nLyon: days 10-12 \u2192 3 days (10,11,12)\n\nWait, day 8 is split between Naples and Frankfurt. So Frankfurt days are 8,9,10 (3 days). Day 10 is split between Frankfurt and Lyon. Lyon days 10,11,12 (3 days). That adds up. Total days:\n\nPrague: 2\n\nHelsinki: 4\n\nNaples: 4\n\nFrankfurt: 3\n\nLyon: 3\n\nTotal: 2+4+4+3+3=16? Wait, no. Wait, but the days are overlapping because of the flights. For example, day 2 is counted in both Prague and Helsinki. Similarly, day 5 is Helsinki and Naples, day 8 is Naples and Frankfurt, day 10 is Frankfurt and Lyon. But the total days should sum to 12. Let's count each day once:\n\nDays 1-12: 12 days total.\n\nEach day is assigned to one or two cities. But the problem states that if you fly on day X from A to B, you are in both cities on day X, contributing to the count for each. So each city's days include the days you arrived and departed. So the counts per city are correct as per the itinerary. The total days in each city add up to the required numbers. So this seems to work.\n\nNow check the flight connections:\n\nPrague to Helsinki: direct flight exists (given in the list: Prague and Helsinki). So day 2: fly from Prague to Helsinki.\n\nHelsinki to Naples: direct flight exists (Helsinki and Naples). So day 5: fly from Helsinki to Naples.\n\nNaples to Frankfurt: direct flight exists. Day 8: fly from Naples to Frankfurt.\n\nFrankfurt to Lyon: direct flight exists. Day 10: fly from Frankfurt to Lyon.\n\nAll flights are direct as per the allowed list.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\n- Prague: Days 1-2\n\n- Helsinki: Days 2-5\n\n- Naples: Days 5-8\n\n- Frankfurt: Days 8-10\n\n- Lyon: Days 10-12\n\nThis satisfies all the constraints: each city has the required number of days, the events in Prague and Helsinki are on the correct days, and all flights are direct.",
