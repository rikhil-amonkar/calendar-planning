    "execution_output": "Based on the requirements and constraints, the trip plan involves visiting Naples, Milan, and Seville with direct flights only between cities that have them (Milan-Seville and Naples-Milan). The key points are:\n\n- Total days: 12\n- Naples: 3 days\n- Seville: 4 days, with days 9-12 fixed for the annual show\n- Milan: 7 days\n- Flight days are counted for both the departure and arrival cities, so overlapping days occur when flying between cities.\n\nThe only feasible sequence that satisfies all constraints is:\n1. Start in Naples for 3 days (days 1-3).\n2. Fly directly from Naples to Milan on day 3 (this day is counted for both Naples and Milan).\n3. Stay in Milan for 7 days, including the flight day (days 3-9).\n4. Fly directly from Milan to Seville on day 9 (this day is counted for both Milan and Seville).\n5. Stay in Seville for 4 days, covering the show (days 9-12).\n\nThis plan uses exactly two flight days (day 3 and day 9), which is consistent with the city-day calculations:\n- Naples: 3 days (days 1-3)\n- Milan: 7 days (days 3-9)\n- Seville: 4 days (days 9-12)\nTotal distinct days: 12, with 14 city-days accounting for the 2 flight day overlaps.\n\nThe direct flights are available as per the given routes.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Naples\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-9\", \"place\": \"Milan\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-12\", \"place\": \"Seville\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
