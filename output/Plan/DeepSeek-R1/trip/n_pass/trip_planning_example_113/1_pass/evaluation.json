    "execution_output": "Based on the constraints provided, the trip must include 3 days in Naples, 4 days in Seville (specifically from day 9 to day 12 for the annual show), and the remaining days in Milan. However, the total days requested (3 in Naples + 4 in Seville + 7 in Milan = 14) exceed the 12-day trip duration. After reviewing the constraints, the only feasible solution is to spend 5 days in Milan, as 3 days in Naples and 4 days in Seville are fixed, leaving 5 days for Milan (12 - 3 - 4 = 5).\n\nThe itinerary must also respect the direct flight connections: flights are only available between Milan and Seville, and between Naples and Milan. There is no direct flight between Naples and Seville, so any transfer between these cities must go through Milan.\n\nGiven that Seville is fixed on days 9-12, and Naples requires 3 consecutive days, the itinerary is structured as follows:\n- Days 1-3: Spend 3 days in Naples.\n- Days 4-8: Spend 5 days in Milan (to connect to Seville).\n- Days 9-12: Spend 4 days in Seville for the annual show.\n\nThis plan uses direct flights:\n- On day 4, fly from Naples to Milan (direct flight available).\n- On day 9, fly from Milan to Seville (direct flight available).\n\nThe JSON output below includes only the city visits with their day ranges, as requested.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\",\n      \"place\": \"Naples\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\",\n      \"place\": \"Milan\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 9-12\",\n      \"place\": \"Seville\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
