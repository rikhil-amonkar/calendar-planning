You plan to stay in Geneva for 2 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 3 days. You have to attend a workshop in Porto between day 19 and day 21. You want to spend 5 days in Tallinn. You plan to stay in Stockholm for 3 days. You want to meet a friend in Stockholm between day 2 and day 4.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nfrom Reykjavik to Stuttgart, Stockholm and Tallinn, Stockholm and Oslo, Stuttgart and Porto, Oslo and Split, Stockholm and Stuttgart, Reykjavik and Oslo, Oslo and Geneva, Stockholm and Split, Reykjavik and Stockholm, Split and Stuttgart, Tallinn and Oslo, Stockholm and Geneva, Oslo and Porto, Geneva and Porto, Geneva and Split.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 21 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."
