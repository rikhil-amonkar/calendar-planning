There is no direct flight between Istanbul and Santorini, so any commute between Istanbul and Santorini must go through London.\n- Santorini must be visited for 6 consecutive days to include both day 5 and day 10, as these are fixed conference days. The only 6-day range that includes both day 5 and day 10 is days 5 to 10.\n\nGiven the constraints, the itinerary is as follows:\n- Days 1 to 3 are spent in Istanbul (3 days).\n- Day 4 is spent in London (1 day), which is used as a transit day to connect to Santorini. Although the plan was to stay in London for 3 days, the available days before the Santorini block only allow for 1 full day in London due to the fixed Santorini schedule. This meets the requirement for a visit to London, but not the full 3-day stay.\n- Days 5 to 10 are spent in Santorini (6 days), covering the conference on day 5 and day 10.\n\nThe direct flights are:\n- From Istanbul to London on day 4 (not included in the JSON output).\n- From London to Santorini on day 5 (not included in the JSON output).\n\nThe JSON output only includes the city stays with their day ranges, as specified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Istanbul\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-4\", \"place\": \"London\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-10\", \"place\": \"Santorini\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
