You want to spend 3 days in Istanbul.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nIstanbul and London, London and Santorini.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 10 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

Start in Istanbul.\n2. Fly to London.\n3.
