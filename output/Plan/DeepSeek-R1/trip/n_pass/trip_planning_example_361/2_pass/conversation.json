This is because the fixed constraints for Madrid and Bucharest occupy days 1-7 and 14-15, leaving only days 8-13 (6 days) for Paris and Seville. However, 6 days are insufficient to accommodate both the required 6 days for Paris and 3 days for Seville (totaling 9 days). \n\nSince Paris must be visited for 6 days and cannot be reduced, and Seville cannot be accommodated within the available days without violating other constraints, Seville is omitted from the itinerary.
