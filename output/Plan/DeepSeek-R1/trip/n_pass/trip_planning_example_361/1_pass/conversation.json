        "content": "After analyzing the constraints, it is determined that the only feasible trip plan that satisfies all given conditions while adhering to the 15-day total and direct flight availability is as follows:\n\n- **Madrid**: Must be visited from Day 1 to Day 7 to attend the annual show and spend 7 days as desired.\n- **Seville**: Visited for 3 days immediately after Madrid, from Day 8 to Day 10, using a direct flight from Madrid to Seville.\n- **Paris**: Visited for 3 days from Day 11 to Day 13. Although 6 days are desired for Paris, the fixed constraints for Madrid, Bucharest, and the 15-day limit make a full 6-day stay impossible without exceeding the total days or conflicting with other requirements. The 3-day stay is the maximum possible given the itinerary.\n- **Bucharest**: Must be visited for 2 days between Day 14 and Day 15 to visit relatives, so the stay is from Day 14 to Day 15. A direct flight from Paris to Bucharest is used.\n\nThis plan uses the available direct flights:\n- Madrid to Seville (direct flight exists)\n- Seville to Paris (direct flight exists)\n- Paris to Bucharest (direct flight exists)\n\nThe itinerary ensures all cities are visited, with the day ranges reflecting the stay in each city. Flight information is not included in the JSON output as per the instructions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-7\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-10\", \"place\": \"Seville\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-13\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-15\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
