        "content": "The trip plan must accommodate the specified stay durations (4 days in Vilnius, 3 days in Munich, 7 days in Mykonos) within the 12-day total, using direct flights as available (Vilnius to Munich, and Munich to Mykonos). The order of cities must respect the direct flight connections: Vilnius (V) to Munich (M), then Munich (M) to Mykonos (K), or the reverse (Mykonos to Munich, then Munich to Vilnius). \n\nTo fit the stays within 12 days, the day ranges include the arrival and departure days for each city, with travel occurring on the same day as the city change. For example:\n- Departing Vilnius and arriving in Munich on the same day means that day is included in the Munich stay range.\n- Similarly, departing Munich and arriving in Mykonos on the same day means that day is included in the Mykonos stay range.\n\nThe chosen itinerary starts in Vilnius, then goes to Munich, and ends in Mykonos:\n- Vilnius: Days 1\u20134 (4 days, including arrival on day 1 and departure on day 4)\n- Travel from Vilnius to Munich on day 4 (direct flight available; not included in output)\n- Munich: Days 4\u20136 (3 days, including arrival on day 4 and departure on day 6)\n- Travel from Munich to Mykonos on day 6 (direct flight available; not included in output)\n- Mykonos: Days 6\u201312 (7 days, including arrival on day 6 and departure on day 12)\n\nThis uses all 12 days (days 1\u201312) and satisfies the stay requirements. The day ranges may overlap at endpoints (e.g., day 4 in both Vilnius and Munich) to account for same-day travel, but each day is assigned to one city in the range based on the destination after travel.\n\nOutput in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\",\n      \"place\": \"Vilnius\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 4-6\",\n      \"place\": \"Munich\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 6-12\",\n      \"place\": \"Mykonos\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
