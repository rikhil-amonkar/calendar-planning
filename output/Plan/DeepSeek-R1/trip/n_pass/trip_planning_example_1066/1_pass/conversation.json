        "content": "It appears there is a mathematical inconsistency in the given constraints, as the sum of the required stay days (4 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 28) exceeds the total trip duration of 21 days. Despite extensive analysis, it is impossible to accommodate all 8 cities with their specified stay durations within 21 days while respecting the flight constraints and other conditions (e.g., Stuttgart must include a day between 1 and 4, and Madrid must be on days 20-21).\n\nHowever, a feasible itinerary can be constructed for 6 cities that meet the total 21-day requirement and all direct flight constraints, as well as the fixed Madrid and Stuttgart constraints. The cities Mykonos and London are omitted to achieve a valid 21-day plan, as including them would require exceeding the 21-day limit. The resulting itinerary uses the following cities and stays:\n- Stuttgart: 4 days (including a day between 1 and 4)\n- Split: 3 days\n- Helsinki: 5 days\n- Brussels: 4 days\n- Bucharest: 3 days\n- Madrid: 2 days (on days 20-21)\n\nThe itinerary is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-7\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-12\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-16\", \"place\": \"Brussels\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-19\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 20-21\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis plan respects the direct flight connections:\n- Stuttgart to Split (direct flight exists)\n- Split to Helsinki (direct flight exists)\n- Helsinki to Brussels (direct flight exists)\n- Brussels to Bucharest (direct flight exists)\n- Bucharest to Madrid (direct flight exists)\n\nThe cities Mykonos and London could not be included without exceeding the 21-day limit or violating flight constraints. If the stay durations were adjustable or additional travel days were allowed, a full 8-city itinerary might be possible, but based on the given constraints, this 6-city plan is the only feasible solution for 21 days."
