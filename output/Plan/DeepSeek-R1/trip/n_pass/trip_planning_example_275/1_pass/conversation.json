        "content": "The constraints require Santorini to be visited on days 13 and 14 for the conference, and the direct flight connections limit the possible sequence to Vilnius \u2192 Split \u2192 Madrid \u2192 Santorini. However, the requested days for each city (Split: 5 days, Vilnius: 4 days, Santorini: 2 days, Madrid: 6 days) sum to 17 days, but only 14 days are available. This makes it impossible to satisfy all the desired visit durations exactly.\n\nAfter evaluating the constraints, the following itinerary is feasible with the given flight connections and fixed Santorini days:\n- Vilnius is visited for 4 days (days 1-4).\n- Split is visited for 5 days (days 5-9).\n- Madrid is visited for 3 days (days 10-12), which is less than the desired 6 days but necessary to fit within the 14-day limit and the Santorini constraint.\n- Santorini is visited for 2 days (days 13-14).\n\nThe direct flights are available between Vilnius and Split (after Vilnius), Split and Madrid (after Split), and Madrid and Santorini (after Madrid).\n\nThe itinerary in the specified JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-12\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-14\", \"place\": \"Santorini\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
