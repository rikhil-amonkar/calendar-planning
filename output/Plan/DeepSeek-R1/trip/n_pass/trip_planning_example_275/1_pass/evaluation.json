The itinerary ensures that:\n\n- Split is visited for 5 days.\n- Vilnius is visited for 4 days.\n- Santorini is visited for 2 days, specifically on days 13 and 14 for the conference.\n- Madrid is visited for 6 days.\n- All flights are direct and between connected cities (Vilnius-Split, Split-Madrid, Madrid-Santorini).\n- Travel days are counted for both the departure and arrival cities, so overlapping days are included in the day ranges (e.g., day 4 is part of both Vilnius and Split).\n- The total days add up to 14, accounting for the shared travel days.\n\nThe sequence is Vilnius \u2192 Split \u2192 Madrid \u2192 Santorini, as this is the only feasible route given the flight connections and the fixed Santorini dates.\n\n**Itinerary:**\n- Vilnius: Days 1-4 (4 days, including travel to Split on day 4).\n- Split: Days 4-8 (5 days, including arrival from Vilnius on day 4 and travel to Madrid on day 8).\n- Madrid: Days 8-13 (6 days, including arrival from Split on day 8 and travel to Santorini on day 13).\n- Santorini: Days 13-14 (2 days, including arrival from Madrid on day 13; conference on days 13 and 14).\n\nThis satisfies all constraints:\n- Day overlaps: Day 4 (Vilnius and Split), day 8 (Split and Madrid), and day 13 (Madrid and Santorini) are shared, reducing the total from 17 individual days to 14 calendar days.\n- Flights: Direct flights occur on day 4 (Vilnius to Split), day 8 (Split to Madrid), and day 13 (Madrid to Santorini), all within the allowed connections.\n- No separate flight entries are included in the JSON, as per the requirement.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\",\n      \"place\": \"Vilnius\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\",\n      \"place\": \"Split\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 8-13\",\n      \"place\": \"Madrid\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 13-14\",\n      \"place\": \"Santorini\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
