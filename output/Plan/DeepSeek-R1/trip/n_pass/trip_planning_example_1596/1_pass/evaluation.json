    "execution_output": "The trip plan is designed to visit all 10 cities within the 32-day period, adhering to the specified stay durations and event constraints while using direct flights for commuting between cities. The day ranges for each city visit are as follows:\n\n- **Edinburgh (5 days)**: Days 1-5 to meet a friend between days 1 and 5.\n- **Barcelona (5 days)**: Days 6-10, using a direct flight from Edinburgh.\n- **Budapest (5 days)**: Days 11-15, using a direct flight from Barcelona, attending the annual show from days 9-13 (overlap on days 11-13).\n- **Stockholm (2 days)**: Days 16-17, using a direct flight from Budapest, meeting friends between days 17 and 18 (overlap on day 17).\n- **Munich (3 days)**: Days 18-20, using a direct flight from Stockholm, attending the workshop between days 18 and 20.\n- **Krakow (4 days)**: Days 21-24, using a direct flight from Munich.\n- **Warsaw (5 days)**: Days 25-29, using a direct flight from Krakow, attending the conference between days 25 and 29.\n- **Bucharest (2 days)**: Days 30-31, using a direct flight from Warsaw.\n- **Riga (5 days)**: Days 32-36, but since the trip ends on day 32, this is adjusted to days 32 only for partial stay (constraints allow flexibility; Riga has no specific date constraint, and the 5-day stay is not fully completed within the 32 days due to the tight schedule).\n- **Vienna (5 days)**: Not included in the 32 days due to time constraints; similarly, the 5-day stay cannot be accommodated.\n\n**Note on Constraints and Flights**:\n- The plan satisfies all event constraints: Edinburgh (meet friend days 1-5), Budapest (show days 9-13, overlap days 11-13), Stockholm (meet friends days 17-18, overlap day 17), Munich (workshop days 18-20), Warsaw (conference days 25-29).\n- Direct flights are used between cities based on the provided list: Edinburgh to Barcelona, Barcelona to Budapest, Budapest to Stockholm, Stockholm to Munich, Munich to Krakow, Krakow to Warsaw, Warsaw to Bucharest, and Bucharest to Riga.\n- Riga and Vienna cannot be fully accommodated within the 32 days due to the total stay days (41) exceeding the available days, even with minimal travel assumptions. Riga is included for a partial stay on day 32 to visit the city, but the 5-day requirement is not met. Vienna is omitted to stay within the 32-day limit.\n- The sum of stay days (41) exceeds the 32-day trip duration, making it impossible to visit all cities for the full durations. This plan prioritizes the event-constrained cities and uses direct flights, but Riga and Vienna are not fully covered.\n\nThe JSON output includes the day ranges for the cities visited within the 32 days.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Edinburgh\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 6-10\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-15\", \"place\": \"Budapest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-17\", \"place\": \"Stockholm\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 18-20\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21-24\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 25-29\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 30-31\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 32\", \"place\": \"Riga\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
