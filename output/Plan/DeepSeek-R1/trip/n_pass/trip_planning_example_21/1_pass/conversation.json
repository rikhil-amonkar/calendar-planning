Therefore, Venice is scheduled for days 5-10 to ensure full coverage of the workshop.\n- Mykonos must be visited for 2 days.\n- Vienna must be visited for 4 days, but due to the fixed Venice period (days 5-10) and the 10-day total, Vienna can only be accommodated for 2 days in this itinerary (days 3-4) to allow for the Mykonos visit.\n- Direct flights are available between Mykonos and Vienna, and between Vienna and Venice, so the itinerary uses these connections: Mykonos to Vienna, then Vienna to Venice.\n- Flight days are not included in the JSON output, as per the requirement.\n\nThe itinerary is as follows:\n- Days 1-2: Mykonos (2-day stay)\n- Days 3-4: Vienna (2-day stay, as 4 days are not possible with the constraints)\n- Days 5-10: Venice (6-day stay, covering the workshop period)\n\nThis plan uses direct flights for commuting and fits within the 10-day total.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\",\n      \"place\": \"Mykonos\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\",\n      \"place\": \"Vienna\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 5-10\",\n      \"place\": \"Venice\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
