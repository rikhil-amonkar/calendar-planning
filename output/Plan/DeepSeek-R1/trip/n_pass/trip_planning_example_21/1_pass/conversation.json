You have to attend a workshop in Venice between day 5 and day 10. You want to spend 2 days in Mykonos. You plan to stay in Vienna for 4 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMykonos and Vienna, Vienna and Venice.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 10 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities.
