        "content": "Based on the constraints provided, it is not possible to spend exactly 2 days in Riga (including the relative visit between day 1 and day 2), 2 days in Amsterdam, and 5 days in Mykonos within a 7-day trip, as the total required days (2 + 2 + 5 = 9) exceed the 7-day limit. However, a feasible itinerary can be created by adjusting the stay in Mykonos to fit the 7-day timeframe while respecting the flight constraints and the requirement to start in Riga on days 1-2.\n\nThe direct flight options are:\n- Amsterdam and Mykonos\n- Riga and Amsterdam\n\nThere is no direct flight between Riga and Mykonos, so travel between them must go through Amsterdam. The itinerary must start in Riga on days 1-2 to accommodate the relative visit. After Riga, the only direct flight is to Amsterdam. From Amsterdam, a direct flight to Mykonos is available. The trip ends in Mykonos on day 7.\n\nThe adjusted itinerary is:\n- Days 1-2 in Riga (2 days, as required).\n- Days 3-4 in Amsterdam (2 days, as required).\n- Days 5-7 in Mykonos (3 days; this is less than the requested 5 days due to the 7-day limit, but it is the maximum possible given the constraints).\n\nThis plan uses direct flights for commuting:\n- Day 3: Fly from Riga to Amsterdam (direct flight).\n- Day 5: Fly from Amsterdam to Mykonos (direct flight).\n\nThe JSON output below reflects the city stays with their day ranges, without including flight information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\",\n      \"place\": \"Riga\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\",\n      \"place\": \"Amsterdam\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 5-7\",\n      \"place\": \"Mykonos\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
