You plan to visit relatives in Riga between day 1 and day 2. You want to spend 2 days in Amsterdam. You plan to stay in Mykonos for 5 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nAmsterdam and Mykonos, Riga and Amsterdam.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 7 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

        "content": "The trip plan must satisfy the following constraints:\n- Total of 7 days.\n- 2 days in Riga, including the relatives visit between day 1 and day 2, so Riga must cover days 1 and 2.\n- 2 days in Amsterdam.\n- 5 days in Mykonos.\n- Direct flights only between Amsterdam and Mykonos, and Riga and Amsterdam. No direct flight between Riga and Mykonos, so the route must be Riga \u2192 Amsterdam \u2192 Mykonos.\n- Flight days are counted for both the departure and arrival cities, meaning shared days reduce the total unique days needed.\n\nGiven that days 1 and 2 must be in Riga for the relatives visit, the itinerary starts in Riga on day 1. To have exactly 2 days in Riga, departure must occur on day 2. The flight from Riga to Amsterdam on day 2 means day 2 is shared between Riga and Amsterdam. Amsterdam then requires 2 days, so departure to Mykonos must occur on day 3 to avoid exceeding the 2-day stay. The flight to Mykonos on day 3 shares day 3 between Amsterdam and Mykonos. Mykonos then covers the remaining days, from day 3 to day 7, for a 5-day stay.\n\nThis results in the following itinerary:\n- Riga: Days 1-2 (2 days, including relatives visit between day 1 and day 2).\n- Amsterdam: Days 2-3 (2 days, with day 2 shared from Riga flight and day 3 shared to Mykonos flight).\n- Mykonos: Days 3-7 (5 days, with day 3 shared from Amsterdam flight).\n\nThe JSON output below reflects this plan, with day ranges for each city stay and no separate flight entries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\",\n      \"place\": \"Riga\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 2-3\",\n      \"place\": \"Amsterdam\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\",\n      \"place\": \"Mykonos\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
