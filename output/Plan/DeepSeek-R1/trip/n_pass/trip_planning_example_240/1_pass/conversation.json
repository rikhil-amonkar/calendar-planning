After careful consideration, the itinerary below prioritizes the key constraints: the conference in Berlin on days 6 and 8, the relatives visit in Tallinn between days 8 and 12, and the direct flight connections. The stay durations are adjusted to fit within 12 days while meeting the critical time-bound requirements.\n\n- Prague is visited for 2 days at the start (days 1-2).\n- Stockholm is visited for 3 days (days 3-5), shorter than the planned 5 days, to allow for the Berlin conference.\n- Berlin is visited for 3 days (days 6-8), covering the conference on days 6 and 8.\n- Tallinn is visited for 4 days (days 9-12), shorter than the planned 5 days, but it includes the relatives visit between days 8 and 12 (specifically days 9-12).\n\nThe flight connections used are:\n- Prague to Stockholm (direct, as per the available flights).\n- Stockholm to Berlin (direct, as per the available flights).\n- Berlin to Tallinn (direct, as per the available flights).\n\nThe itinerary in the specified JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"Stockholm\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 6-8\", \"place\": \"Berlin\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-12\", \"place\": \"Tallinn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
