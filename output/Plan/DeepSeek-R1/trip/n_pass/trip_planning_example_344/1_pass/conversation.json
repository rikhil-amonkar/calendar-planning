        "content": "The trip plan must adhere to the constraints: Athens from day 1 to day 6 (6 days), Naples from day 16 to day 20 (5 days), and the remaining days for Zurich and Valencia. However, with only 9 days available between day 7 and day 15, and both Zurich and Valencia requiring 6 days each (12 days total), it is impossible to allocate 6 days to both cities without exceeding the 20-day total or conflicting with the fixed stays. Therefore, one city must have a shorter stay.\n\nThe feasible plan is:\n- Athens: Days 1-6 (6 days), satisfying the relative visit between day 1 and day 6.\n- Zurich: Days 7-9 (3 days), as Zurich has no specific time constraint and can be shortened.\n- Valencia: Days 10-15 (6 days), achieving the desired 6-day stay.\n- Naples: Days 16-20 (5 days), satisfying the wedding between day 16 and day 20 and the 5-day visit.\n\nThis plan uses the available direct flights:\n- Athens to Zurich on day 7 (direct flight available).\n- Zurich to Valencia on day 10 (direct flight available).\n- Valencia to Naples on day 16 (direct flight available).\n\nThe itinerary in the specified JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-6\", \"place\": \"Athens\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Zurich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-15\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-20\", \"place\": \"Naples\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
