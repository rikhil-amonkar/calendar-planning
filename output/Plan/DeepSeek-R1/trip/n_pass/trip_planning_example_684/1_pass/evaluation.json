The itinerary ensures that all stays meet the specified durations and event windows, with direct flights between consecutive cities. The day ranges account for the sequential visits, with transitions occurring on the same day (e.g., departing one city and arriving in the next on the same day).\n\nThe itinerary in JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\",\n      \"place\": \"Edinburgh\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 5-8\",\n      \"place\": \"Amsterdam\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 8-12\",\n      \"place\": \"Vienna\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 12-16\",\n      \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 16-19\",\n      \"place\": \"Berlin\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 19-23\",\n      \"place\": \"Brussels\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Edinburgh**: Stay of 5 days from Day 1 to Day 5.\n- **Amsterdam**: Stay of 4 days from Day 5 to Day 8, covering the required period for visiting relatives (Day 5 to Day 8).\n- **Vienna**: Stay of 5 days from Day 8 to Day 12.\n- **Reykjavik**: Stay of 5 days from Day 12 to Day 16, covering the workshop period (Day 12 to Day 16).\n- **Berlin**: Stay of 4 days from Day 16 to Day 19, covering the meeting period (Day 16 to Day 19).\n- **Brussels**: Stay of 5 days from Day 19 to Day 23.\n\nThe sequence of cities is connected by direct flights:\n- Edinburgh to Amsterdam (direct flight available).\n- Amsterdam to Vienna (direct flight available).\n- Vienna to Reykjavik (direct flight available).\n- Reykjavik to Berlin (direct flight available).\n- Berlin to Brussels (direct flight available).\n\nThe total trip spans 23 days, from Day 1 to Day 23, with all stay durations summing to 23 days after accounting for the overlapping transition days (e.g., Day 5, Day 8, Day 12, Day 16, and Day 19 are shared between consecutive cities due to same-day travel).",
