    "execution_output": "The trip plan must satisfy the following constraints:\n- Total of 11 days.\n- Spend 6 days in Seville, 2 days in Paris, and 5 days in Krakow.\n- Attend a workshop in Krakow between Day 1 and Day 5, so Krakow must include Days 1-5.\n- Only direct flights are available between Krakow and Paris, and Paris and Seville. No direct flight exists between Krakow and Seville, so travel must go through Paris.\n- Flight days count for both the departure and arrival cities. For example, if flying from Krakow to Paris on Day X, Day X is included in both Krakow and Paris stays.\n\nGiven the workshop constraint, Krakow must cover Days 1-5 for 5 days. To achieve the required stays:\n- Krakow: Days 1-5 (5 days, including the workshop).\n- Fly from Krakow to Paris on Day 5. Day 5 is counted for both Krakow (departure) and Paris (arrival).\n- Paris: Days 5-6 (2 days, with Day 5 as arrival and Day 6 as departure to Seville).\n- Fly from Paris to Seville on Day 6. Day 6 is counted for both Paris (departure) and Seville (arrival).\n- Seville: Days 6-11 (6 days, with Day 6 as arrival and Days 7-11 as full days).\n\nThis plan uses the available direct flights and meets all stay requirements:\n- Krakow: 5 days (Days 1-5).\n- Paris: 2 days (Days 5-6, with Day 5 shared with Krakow and Day 6 shared with Seville).\n- Seville: 6 days (Days 6-11, with Day 6 shared with Paris).\n- Total city-days: 5 (Krakow) + 2 (Paris) + 6 (Seville) = 13, which accounts for 11 days plus 2 flight days (Day 5 and Day 6).\n\nThe JSON itinerary lists the day ranges for each city without separate flight entries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-6\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 6-11\", \"place\": \"Seville\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
