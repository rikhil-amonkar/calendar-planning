    "execution_output": "The trip plan must satisfy the following constraints:\n- Total trip duration: 11 days (Day 1 to Day 11).\n- Spend 6 days in Seville, 2 days in Paris, and 5 days in Krakow.\n- Attend a workshop in Krakow between Day 1 and Day 5, which requires being in Krakow during this period.\n- Direct flights are only available between Krakow and Paris, and between Paris and Seville.\n- The itinerary must consist of one continuous stay per city, with flights on the days between stays.\n\nGiven the workshop constraint in Krakow between Day 1 and Day 5, and the 5-day stay in Krakow, Krakow must be scheduled from Day 1 to Day 5 to ensure full coverage of the workshop period. This uses Days 1-5.\n\nAfter Krakow, the remaining days are Days 6-11 (6 days). However, the requirements are to spend 2 days in Paris and 6 days in Seville, totaling 8 days, but only 6 days are available. This indicates a conflict, but the only feasible order respecting flight routes is Krakow \u2192 Paris \u2192 Seville.\n\nTo resolve:\n- Fly from Krakow to Paris on Day 6 (travel day, not counted in city stay).\n- Paris stay: 2 days, scheduled for Days 6-7 (arrive on Day 6, depart on Day 8).\n- Fly from Paris to Seville on Day 8 (travel day, not counted in city stay).\n- Seville stay: Days 8-11 (4 days), but 6 days are required, resulting in a shortfall.\n\nDespite the shortfall in Seville, this is the only workable plan that meets the flight constraints and workshop requirement. The itinerary is as follows:\n\n- Krakow: Day 1-5 (5 days, covering the workshop).\n- Paris: Day 6-7 (2 days).\n- Seville: Day 8-11 (4 days, though 6 are desired; this is a compromise due to the day count issue).\n\nThe JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 6-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Seville\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
