However, based on the requirements and available direct flights, the following itinerary is constructed to meet as many constraints as possible:\n\n- Madrid is visited from Day 1 to Day 4 to accommodate the relative visit between Day 1 and Day 4 and the 4-day stay.\n- Seville is visited from Day 5 to Day 6 for the 2-day stay, using the direct flight from Madrid to Seville.\n- On Day 6, travel from Seville to Porto (direct flight) to position for the flight to Stuttgart.\n- Porto is only partially visited on Day 6 due to the need to be in Stuttgart by Day 7. However, the 3-day stay for Porto cannot be fully accommodated with the available days, resulting in only 1 day in Porto.\n- Stuttgart is visited from Day 7 to Day 13 for the 7-day stay, including the conferences on Day 7 and Day 13, with a direct flight from Porto to Stuttgart.\n\nThe itinerary meets the following key constraints:\n- Madrid: 4 days (Day 1-4) with relatives visited between Day 1 and Day 4.\n- Stuttgart: 7 days (Day 7-13) with conferences on Day 7 and Day 13.\n- Seville: 2 days (Day 5-6).\n- Porto: Only 1 day (Day 6) instead of the desired 3 days due to the day limit and Stuttgart constraint.\n- Flight connectivity is respected: Madrid to Seville (direct), Seville to Porto (direct), Porto to Stuttgart (direct).\n\nThe JSON output below reflects the city stays with their day ranges, excluding flight information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-6\", \"place\": \"Seville\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 6\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-13\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
