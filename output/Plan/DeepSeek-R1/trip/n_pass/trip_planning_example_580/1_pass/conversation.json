However, due to the fixed constraints (Geneva must be occupied on days 1-7 for the conference, and Oslo must include at least one day between 19 and 23 for the relatives visit), the desired stay durations cannot all be fully satisfied within the 23-day limit. Specifically:\n\n- Geneva: Fixed on days 1-7 (7 days, as desired).\n- Paris: 6 days achieved (days 8-13).\n- Reykjavik: 2 days achieved (days 14-15).\n- Oslo: 5 days achieved (days 16-20), which includes days 19 and 20, satisfying the relatives visit constraint between days 19 and 23.\n- Porto: Only 3 days can be accommodated (days 21-23), falling short of the desired 7 days due to the time constraints.\n\nThe itinerary uses direct flights as follows (not included in output):\n- Day 8: Fly from Geneva to Paris (direct flight available).\n- Day 14: Fly from Paris to Reykjavik (direct flight available).\n- Day 16: Fly from Reykjavik to Oslo (direct flight available).\n- Day 21: Fly from Oslo to Porto (direct flight available).\n\nThe JSON output below includes only the city visits with their day ranges, as specified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-7\", \"place\": \"Geneva\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-13\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-15\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-20\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21-23\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
