    "execution_output": "It is mathematically impossible to satisfy all the given constraints with the provided stay durations and 16-day trip duration. The sum of the required stay days is 21 (5 for Porto, 4 for Prague, 4 for Reykjavik, 2 for Santorini, 2 for Amsterdam, and 4 for Munich), which exceeds the 16-day total. Additionally, the fixed events and flight connectivity constraints cannot be fully satisfied within 16 days without violating the stay durations or event requirements.\n\nHowever, based on the fixed events and flight connections, a feasible itinerary can be constructed that satisfies the event constraints and flight connectivity, but it requires adjusting the stay durations for some cities to fit within 16 days. The adjusted itinerary prioritizes the fixed events:\n\n- Reykjavik: Must include the wedding between day 4 and day 7, so the stay is set for days 4-7 (4 days).\n- Amsterdam: Must include the conference on days 14 and 15, so the stay is set for days 14-15 (2 days).\n- Santorini: Only connected to Amsterdam, so it must be visited immediately before Amsterdam, on days 12-13 (2 days).\n- Munich: Must include the friend meeting between day 7 and day 10. With the above, days 8-11 are available (4 days).\n- Porto: 5 days needed, but only days 1-3 and 16 are partially available. It is placed on days 1-5 to avoid overlap, but this conflicts with Reykjavik's start on day 4. To resolve, Porto is shortened to 3 days (days 1-3).\n- Prague: 4 days needed, but no continuous block available without overlap. It is placed on days 8-11, but this conflicts with Munich. Thus, Prague is omitted or shortened, but to include it, days 5-8 are used, overlapping with Reykjavik's end.\n\nAfter adjustments, the following itinerary satisfies the events and flight connectivity, but with reduced stays for Porto and Prague:\n\n- **Porto**: Days 1-3 (3 days instead of 5)  \n  Flight to Reykjavik (direct flight exists via Munich or other connections, but flight not in output).\n- **Reykjavik**: Days 4-7 (4 days, wedding covered)  \n  Flight to Munich (direct flight).\n- **Munich**: Days 8-11 (4 days, friend meeting covered)  \n  Flight to Prague (direct flight).\n- **Prague**: Days 12-13 (2 days instead of 4)  \n  Flight to Amsterdam (direct flight).\n- **Amsterdam**: Days 14-15 (2 days, conference covered)  \n  Flight to Santorini (direct flight, but Santorini must be before Amsterdam for connectivity; this is handled by placing Santorini earlier, but in this sequence, it's after, which is not ideal).\n\nThe flight from Prague to Amsterdam is direct, and Amsterdam to Santorini is direct, but Santorini should be before Amsterdam. In this sequence, Santorini is not included due to time constraints. To include Santorini, it must be before Amsterdam on days 12-13, but this conflicts with Prague.\n\nGiven the issues, the only workable solution with all cities visited and events satisfied involves shortening stays and adjusting the order. The final itinerary below includes Santorini before Amsterdam and reduces Prague's stay:\n\n- **Porto**: Days 1-3 (3 days)  \n  Flight to Munich (direct).\n- **Munich**: Days 4-7 (4 days, friend meeting covered as days 4-7 overlap with 7-10)  \n  Flight to Reykjavik (direct).\n- **Reykjavik**: Days 8-11 (4 days, but wedding between 4-7 not covered\u2014days 8-11 are after the window)  \n  Flight to Amsterdam (direct).\n- **Santorini**: Days 12-13 (2 days, via flight from Amsterdam, but Reykjavik to Amsterdam to Santorini not direct in one day; assume flight from Reykjavik to Amsterdam on day 12, then to Santorini same day, but stay starts on day 12)  \n  Flight to Amsterdam (direct).\n- **Amsterdam**: Days 14-15 (2 days, conference covered)  \n- **Prague**: Not visited due to time and conflicts, or placed on days 12-13 but conflicts with Santorini.\n\nThis still has issues with the wedding and friend meeting coverage.\n\nAfter thorough analysis, the constraints cannot all be met simultaneously within 16 days. Below is the best-effort itinerary that satisfies the fixed events (wedding, conference, friend meeting) and flight connectivity, with stay durations as close as possible to the requirements. Porto is reduced to 3 days, Prague to 2 days, and Reykjavik covers the wedding:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-7\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-13\", \"place\": \"Santorini\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-15\", \"place\": \"Amsterdam\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-16\", \"place\": \"Prague\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of compromises:**\n- **Porto**: Stay reduced from 5 to 3 days (days 1-3).\n- **Reykjavik**: Stay of 4 days (days 4-7) covers the wedding between day 4 and day 7.\n- **Munich**: Stay of 4 days (days 8-11) covers the friend meeting between day 7 and day 10 (overlap on day 8-10).\n- **Santorini**: Stay of 2 days (days 12-13) with direct flight from Munich via Amsterdam (not direct, but connectivity through Amsterdam exists; flight not shown).\n- **Amsterdam**: Stay of 2 days (days 14-15) covers the conference on days 14 and 15.\n- **Prague**: Stay reduced to 1 day (day 16) to include the city, but this is less than the desired 4 days. Flight from Amsterdam to Prague is direct.\n\n**Flight connectivity notes (not in output):**\n- Porto to Reykjavik: No direct flight; routed through Munich (Porto-Munich-Reykjavik, using direct flights).\n- Reykjavik to Munich: Direct flight exists.\n- Munich to Santorini: No direct flight; routed through Amsterdam (Munich-Amsterdam-Santorini, using direct flights).\n- Santorini to Amsterdam: Direct flight exists.\n- Amsterdam to Prague: Direct flight exists.\n\nThis itinerary is the closest feasible solution given the constraints, but it does not fully meet the desired stay durations for Porto and Prague. The sum of stay days is 3+4+4+2+2+1=16 days, fitting within the 16-day trip. For a perfect solution, the stay durations or trip length would need adjustment.",
