You want to spend 7 days in Bucharest. You are going to attend a wedding in Bucharest between day 1 and day 7. You want to spend 4 days in Porto.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBucharest and Lyon, Lyon and Porto.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

        "content": "The trip plan must accommodate the 16-day total, with 7 days in Lyon, 7 days in Bucharest, and 4 days in Porto. The wedding in Bucharest must occur between day 1 and day 7, so Bucharest must be visited during this period. Direct flights are only available between Bucharest and Lyon, and Lyon and Porto, so the itinerary must follow Bucharest \u2192 Lyon \u2192 Porto or Porto \u2192 Lyon \u2192 Bucharest. However, starting in Porto would result in Bucharest being visited after day 7, missing the wedding. Thus, the only feasible sequence is Bucharest first, then Lyon, then Porto.\n\n- Bucharest: Days 1 to 7 (7 days, covering the wedding period).\n- Fly to Lyon on day 7 (day 7 is counted for both Bucharest and Lyon).\n- Lyon: Days 7 to 13 (7 days).\n- Fly to Porto on day 13 (day 13 is counted for both Lyon and Porto).\n- Porto: Days 13 to 16 (4 days).\n\nThis plan uses 16 distinct days with the flight days (day 7 and day 13) shared between cities, as required. The JSON output lists the city visits with their day ranges, without separate flight entries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-7\",\n      \"place\": \"Bucharest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 7-13\",\n      \"place\": \"Lyon\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 13-16\",\n      \"place\": \"Porto\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
