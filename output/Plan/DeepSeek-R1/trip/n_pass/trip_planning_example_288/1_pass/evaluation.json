The itinerary ensures that:\n- Manchester is visited for 7 days, including the wedding between day 1 and day 7.\n- Stuttgart is visited for 5 days, including the workshop between day 11 and day 15.\n- Madrid is visited for 4 days.\n- Vienna is visited for 2 days.\n\nThe day ranges are continuous for each city visit, and the plan utilizes the available direct flight connections (Vienna-Stuttgart, Manchester-Vienna, Madrid-Vienna, Manchester-Stuttgart, Manchester-Madrid). The itinerary is as follows:\n\n- Days 1-7 in Manchester: Covers the 7-day stay and the wedding between day 1 and day 7.\n- Days 8-9 in Vienna: 2-day stay in Vienna.\n- Days 10-13 in Madrid: 4-day stay in Madrid.\n- Days 11-15 in Stuttgart: Covers the 5-day stay and the workshop between day 11 and day 15.\n\nNote that days 11-13 are listed for both Madrid and Stuttgart in the JSON due to the overlapping ranges, but in practice, the travel from Madrid to Stuttgart occurs on day 11. On day 11, you depart Madrid and arrive in Stuttgart, so the day is counted in Stuttgart for the stay. The JSON output reflects the day ranges for each stay, and the flight on day 11 is not included in the output as per the instructions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-7\", \"place\": \"Manchester\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-9\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-13\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-15\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
