    "execution_output": "After analyzing the constraints and available direct flights, a feasible itinerary that satisfies all conditions is determined. The total trip duration is 8 days, with the following stay durations: Prague for 4 days, Stuttgart for 2 days, Split for 2 days, Krakow for 2 days, and Florence for 2 days. The wedding in Stuttgart occurs between day 2 and day 3, and the meeting with friends in Split occurs between day 3 and day 4. The direct flights enable the following sequence:\n\n- Start in Krakow for 2 days (days 1-2), allowing a direct flight to Stuttgart.\n- Fly to Stuttgart for 2 days (days 2-4), covering the wedding between day 2 and day 3. Note that the stay in Stuttgart includes both day 2 and day 3 to ensure the wedding is attended, with day 4 also in Stuttgart.\n- Fly directly to Split for 2 days (days 4-6), arriving on day 4 for the meeting between day 3 and day 4 (which is covered on day 4). The stay in Split includes day 4 and extends to day 6.\n- Fly directly to Prague for 4 days (days 6-9), but since the trip is only 8 days, adjust to end on day 8. However, this exceeds the 8-day limit. Instead, from Split, fly to Prague on day 6 and stay until day 8, but that is only 3 days for Prague, which is insufficient. Re-evaluate the sequence.\n\nRevised sequence:\n- Start in Florence for 2 days (days 1-2), flying from Florence to Prague (direct flight available).\n- Stay in Prague for 4 days (days 2-5). Note: Arrive in Prague on day 2 from Florence, so days 2-5 in Prague cover 4 days (days 2, 3, 4, 5).\n- Fly directly from Prague to Krakow on day 5.\n- Stay in Krakow for 2 days (days 5-6).\n- Fly directly from Krakow to Stuttgart on day 6.\n- Stay in Stuttgart for 2 days (days 6-8). But the wedding must be between day 2 and day 3, which is not covered. This sequence does not satisfy the event constraints.\n\nFinal feasible itinerary:\n- **Days 1-2: Krakow** \u2013 Fly directly to Stuttgart.\n- **Days 2-4: Stuttgart** \u2013 Stay includes days 2, 3, and 4. The wedding between day 2 and day 3 is covered. However, this is 3 days, but Stuttgart requires only 2 days. Adjust to days 2-3 for Stuttgart (2 days), but then Split must start on day 4 for the meeting, but the meeting is between day 3 and day 4, requiring Split to include day 3 or 4. If Stuttgart is days 2-3, then on day 3 in Stuttgart, but meeting in Split on day 3 or 4, so conflict on day 3.\n\nSolution with split stays or adjusted events:\nAssume the wedding in Stuttgart is on day 2, and the meeting in Split is on day 4.\n- **Days 1-2: Stuttgart** \u2013 Covers wedding on day 2. Fly directly to Split.\n- **Days 2-4: Split** \u2013 Arrive on day 2, but stay includes days 2, 3, 4, covering meeting on day 4. But this is 3 days for Split, while only 2 are required. Not optimal.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the only workable itinerary that meets all constraints is:\n\n- **Days 1-2: Krakow** (2 days)\n- Fly directly to Stuttgart on day 2.\n- **Days 2-3: Stuttgart** (2 days, covering the wedding between day 2 and day 3 on day 2 or 3)\n- Fly directly to Split on day 3.\n- **Days 3-4: Split** (2 days, covering the meeting between day 3 and day 4 on day 3 or 4)\n- Fly directly to Prague on day 4.\n- **Days 4-7: Prague** (4 days, but days 4,5,6,7 is 4 days, ending on day 7)\n- On day 7, fly to Florence, but day 8 needed for Florence.\n- Days 4-7 in Prague is 4 days, but day 7 is included, then on day 8 fly to Florence, but Florence needs 2 days. Not enough days.\n\nIncorporate Florence:\n- From Prague, fly to Florence for 2 days, but within the Prague stay.\n- **Days 1-2: Prague** (part of Prague stay)\n- Fly to Florence on day 2.\n- **Days 2-3: Florence** (2 days)\n- Fly back to Prague on day 3.\n- **Days 3-5: Prague** (days 3,4,5, so with days 1-2, total Prague 4 days: days 1,2,3,4,5 but days 2-3 in Florence, so Prague days 1,3,4,5? Not contiguous and days overlap.\n\nCorrect and feasible itinerary:\n- **Days 1-2: Prague** (2 days)\n- Fly directly to Florence on day 2 (arrive day 2).\n- **Days 2-3: Florence** (2 days) \u2013 Depart on day 3.\n- Fly back to Prague on day 3 (arrive day 3).\n- **Days 3-4: Prague** (2 days, total Prague 4 days: days 1,2,3,4)\n- On day 4, fly directly to Split.\n- **Days 4-5: Split** (2 days) \u2013 Meeting between day 3 and day 4 covered on day 4.\n- Fly directly to Stuttgart on day 5.\n- **Days 5-6: Stuttgart** (2 days) \u2013 But wedding between day 2 and day 3 not covered; days 5-6 are too late.\n- Not feasible.\n\nGiven the constraints, the following itinerary works by placing the events correctly and using direct flights:\n\n- **Days 1-2: Stuttgart** \u2013 Wedding between day 2 and day 3 covered on day 2.\n- Fly directly to Split on day 2 (arrive day 2).\n- **Days 2-3: Split** \u2013 Meeting between day 3 and day 4 covered on day 3. But stay is days 2-3 (2 days).\n- Fly directly to Krakow on day 3.\n- **Days 3-4: Krakow** (2 days)\n- Fly directly to Prague on day 4.\n- **Days 4-7: Prague** (4 days, days 4,5,6,7)\n- Fly directly to Florence on day 7.\n- **Days 7-8: Florence** (2 days)\n\nBut Florence is only connected to Prague, so from Prague to Florence on day 7 is direct. This uses days 1-8.\n\n- Day 1: Stuttgart\n- Day 2: Stuttgart (depart to Split, arrive same day) and Split\n- But day 2 cannot be in two cities; travel is on day 2 from Stuttgart to Split, so day 2 is partially in Stuttgart and Split, but for the itinerary, assign full days to the city of stay at night or for the majority. To simplify, on day 2, stay in Stuttgart until flight, then in Split, but the output requires day ranges for stays, so separate entries.\n\nFinal itinerary with day ranges:\n\n- **Days 1-2: Stuttgart** \u2013 2 days, covering wedding on day 2.\n- Fly to Split on day 2 (arrive day 2), but for stay, **Days 2-3: Split** \u2013 2 days, covering meeting on day 3.\n- Fly to Krakow on day 3 (arrive day 3), **Days 3-4: Krakow** \u2013 2 days.\n- Fly to Prague on day 4 (arrive day 4), **Days 4-7: Prague** \u2013 4 days (days 4,5,6,7).\n- On day 7, fly to Florence (arrive day 7), **Days 7-8: Florence** \u2013 2 days.\n\nThis satisfies:\n- Total days: 8 days.\n- Prague: 4 days (days 4-7).\n- Stuttgart: 2 days (days 1-2), wedding between day 2-3 covered on day 2.\n- Split: 2 days (days 2-3), meeting between day 3-4 covered on day 3.\n- Krakow: 2 days (days 3-4).\n- Florence: 2 days (days 7-8).\n- Direct flights used: Stuttgart to Split, Split to Krakow (direct flight available: Krakow and Split), Krakow to Prague (direct), Prague to Florence (direct).\n\nThe day ranges are:\n- Stuttgart: Days 1-2\n- Split: Days 2-3\n- Krakow: Days 3-4\n- Prague: Days 4-7\n- Florence: Days 7-8\n\nNote that days 2, 3, 4, and 7 involve flights, but the JSON output only includes the stay ranges, not flight details.\n\nJSON output:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-3\", \"place\": \"Split\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-7\", \"place\": \"Prague\"}, {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-8\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}]}\n\nThis meets all constraints and uses direct flights.\n<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581thinking\uff5c>\nThe trip plan satisfies all constraints: 8 days total, stay durations (Prague 4 days, Stuttgart 2 days, Split 2 days, Krakow 2 days, Florence 2 days), event timings (wedding in Stuttgart between day 2-3 covered on day 2, meeting in Split between day 3-4 covered on day 3), and direct flights between cities. The itinerary uses the following sequence with direct flights:\n\n- **Stuttgart to Split**: Direct flight available.\n- **Split to Krakow**: Direct flight available (Krakow and Split).\n- **Krakow to Prague**: Direct flight available.\n- **Prague to Florence**: Direct flight available.\n\nThe day ranges for each city visit are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-3\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-7\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-8\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
