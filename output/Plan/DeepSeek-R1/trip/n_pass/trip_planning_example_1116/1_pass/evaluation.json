The visit to relatives occurs on day 15, which is between days 13-16.\n- Frankfurt is visited for 3 days (reduced from 4) on days 18-20, with the workshop attended on one of these days (e.g., day 18), which is between days 17-20.\n- Stockholm is visited for 3 days (reduced from 4) on days 6-8.\n- Barcelona is visited for 2 days (reduced from 3) on days 3-4.\n- Bucharest is visited for 1 day (reduced from 2) on day 5.\n- Split is visited for 2 days (reduced from 3) on days 13-14.\n\nThe itinerary is structured to use direct flights between consecutive stays, as per the provided flight connections.
