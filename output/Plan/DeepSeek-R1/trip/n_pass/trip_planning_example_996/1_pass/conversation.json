        "content": "It appears there is a mathematical inconsistency in the problem constraints. The sum of the required stay days for all seven cities is 28 days (Valencia: 5, Riga: 5, Prague: 3, Mykonos: 3, Zurich: 5, Bucharest: 5, Nice: 2), but the total trip duration is only 22 days. This makes it impossible to satisfy all stay duration requirements within the 22-day period, even accounting for direct flights and the fixed constraints for Mykonos and Prague.\n\nHowever, to provide a feasible trip plan that respects the direct flight connections and the fixed time constraints for Mykonos and Prague, the following itinerary is constructed by prioritizing the fixed events and adjusting the stay durations where necessary, while ensuring all cities are visited with direct flights between them. The day ranges are determined based on the flight connections and the requirement to include the wedding in Mykonos between days 1-3 and the relative visit in Prague between days 7-9.\n\n- Mykonos must include days 1-3 for the wedding, so it is scheduled for days 1-3.\n- Prague must include days 7-9 for the relative visit, so it is scheduled for days 7-9.\n- The remaining days (4-6 and 10-22) are allocated to the other cities, but with reduced stay durations for some cities to fit within 22 days, as the total required days exceed the available days.\n\nThe itinerary uses the following direct flight sequence to connect the cities:\n- Mykonos to Zurich (direct flight exists)\n- Zurich to Prague (direct flight exists)\n- Prague to Bucharest (direct flight exists)\n- Bucharest to Valencia (direct flight exists)\n- Valencia to Zurich (direct flight exists, but Zurich is revisited to connect to other cities)\n- Zurich to Riga (direct flight exists)\n- Riga to Nice (direct flight exists)\n\nThe JSON output below provides the trip plan with day ranges for each city visit. Flight days are not included in the output, as per the instructions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-5\", \"place\": \"Zurich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-12\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-17\", \"place\": \"Zurich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 18-20\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21-22\", \"place\": \"Nice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the plan:**\n- **Mykonos (Days 1-3):** Covers the wedding between days 1-3.\n- **Zurich (Days 4-5):** Reduced from 5 to 2 days to fit the schedule. Direct flight from Mykonos to Zurich on day 4.\n- **Prague (Days 7-9):** Covers the relative visit between days 7-9. Direct flight from Zurich to Prague on day 7 (after a travel day on day 6, not output).\n- **Bucharest (Days 10-12):** Reduced from 5 to 3 days. Direct flight from Prague to Bucharest on day 10.\n- **Valencia (Days 13-15):** Reduced from 5 to 3 days. Direct flight from Bucharest to Valencia on day 13.\n- **Zurich (Days 16-17):** Revisited for 2 days (partial stay) to connect to Riga. Direct flight from Valencia to Zurich on day 16.\n- **Riga (Days 18-20):** Reduced from 5 to 3 days. Direct flight from Zurich to Riga on day 18.\n- **Nice (Days 21-22):** Reduced from 2 to 2 days (full duration). Direct flight from Riga to Nice on day 21.\n\nThis plan ensures all cities are visited with direct flights, adheres to the fixed constraints for Mykonos and Prague, and fits within the 22-day limit by reducing the stay durations for Zurich, Bucharest, Valencia, and Riga. The total stay days are 22, matching the trip duration. Note that day 6 is a travel day from Zurich to Prague (not included in output), and other flights occur on the days between the stays."
