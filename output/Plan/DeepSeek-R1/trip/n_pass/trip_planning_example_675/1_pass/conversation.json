        "content": "Based on the constraints and the available direct flights, a feasible trip plan that satisfies all given conditions is as follows:\n\n- **Split (3 days)**: Days 1-3. This meets the requirement to visit Split for 3 days.\n- **Munich (5 days)**: Days 4-8. This includes the annual show from day 4 to day 8 and meets the 5-day stay requirement.\n- **Krakow (2 days)**: Days 9-10. This includes the meeting with friends between day 8 and day 9 (specifically on day 9) and meets the 2-day visit requirement.\n- **Milan (3 days)**: Days 11-13. This includes the wedding between day 11 and day 13 and meets the 3-day visit requirement.\n- **Porto (4 days)**: Days 13-16. This meets the requirement to spend 4 days in Porto. Note that the stay in Porto starts on day 13, the same day the stay in Milan ends, which is possible with direct flights (Milan and Porto have a direct flight).\n\n**Explanation of the sequence and flight feasibility:**\n- From Split to Munich: Direct flight available (Munich and Split).\n- From Munich to Krakow: Direct flight available (Munich and Krakow).\n- From Krakow to Milan: Direct flight available (Krakow and Milan).\n- From Milan to Porto: Direct flight available (Milan and Porto).\n\n**Dubrovnik is not included in this plan.** Despite the intention to stay in Dubrovnik for 4 days, the constraints and available days make it impossible to include all six cities with their desired stay durations within the 16-day period while adhering to the event dates and direct flight connections. The sum of the minimum required stay days (4 Dubrovnik + 3 Split + 3 Milan + 4 Porto + 2 Krakow + 5 Munich = 21 days) exceeds the 16-day trip duration, and the fixed event dates further restrict flexibility. Attempts to include Dubrovnik resulted in conflicts with other constraints or missing another city. Therefore, Dubrovnik is omitted to satisfy the other requirements.\n\nThe output below includes the five cities that can be accommodated, with their day ranges, in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-10\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-13\", \"place\": \"Milan\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-16\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The day range for Porto starts on day 13, the same day the stay in Milan ends, indicating a same-day flight from Milan to Porto. This is feasible with direct flights and does not require an additional travel day. The itinerary adheres to all direct flight connections and event constraints."
