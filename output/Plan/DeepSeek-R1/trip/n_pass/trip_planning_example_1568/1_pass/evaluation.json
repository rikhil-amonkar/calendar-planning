    "execution_output": "After analyzing the constraints and available direct flights, a feasible trip plan has been devised for the 20-day visit to the 10 European cities. The plan ensures all fixed date requirements are met (e.g., the show in Prague on days 5-9, the conference in Stockholm on days 16-17, meeting friends in Riga on day 15, visiting relatives in Split on day 13, and meeting a friend in Vienna between days 1-5). Due to the tight schedule and the sum of desired days exceeding 20, some city stays are shorter than initially desired (e.g., Brussels, Seville, Amsterdam, Split, Munich, and Riga are each assigned 1 day instead of 2 or 3), but all fixed events are covered, and all cities are visited with direct flights connecting them.\n\nThe itinerary in the required JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10\", \"place\": \"Brussels\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11\", \"place\": \"Seville\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12\", \"place\": \"Amsterdam\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-17\", \"place\": \"Stockholm\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 18-20\", \"place\": \"Istanbul\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Plan:\n- **Vienna (Days 1-4)**: Covers the 5-day desired stay as much as possible within days 1-4 (4 days instead of 5) and includes a meeting between days 1-5.\n- **Prague (Days 5-9)**: Fixed 5-day stay for the annual show.\n- **Brussels (Day 10)**: 1-day visit (desired 2 days not fully met).\n- **Seville (Day 11)**: 1-day visit (desired 3 days not fully met).\n- **Amsterdam (Day 12)**: 1-day visit (desired 3 days not fully met).\n- **Split (Day 13)**: 1-day visit (desired 3 days not fully met), but covers the relative visit between days 11-13.\n- **Munich (Day 14)**: 1-day visit (desired 2 days not fully met).\n- **Riga (Day 15)**: 1-day visit (desired 2 days not fully met), but covers the meeting between days 15-16.\n- **Stockholm (Days 16-17)**: Fixed 2-day stay for the conference.\n- **Istanbul (Days 18-20)**: 3-day visit (exceeds the desired 2 days slightly, but fits the remaining days).\n\n### Flight Connectivity (for reference, not in output):\n- Day 4 to 5: Vienna to Prague (direct flight available).\n- Day 9 to 10: Prague to Brussels (direct flight available).\n- Day 10 to 11: Brussels to Seville (direct flight available).\n- Day 11 to 12: Seville to Amsterdam (direct flight available).\n- Day 12 to 13: Amsterdam to Split (direct flight available).\n- Day 13 to 14: Split to Munich (direct flight available).\n- Day 14 to 15: Munich to Riga (direct flight available).\n- Day 15 to 16: Riga to Stockholm (direct flight available).\n- Day 17 to 18: Stockholm to Istanbul (direct flight available).\n\nThis plan efficiently uses the 20 days, satisfies all fixed date constraints, and utilizes the available direct flights between cities. The JSON output includes only the city visits with their day ranges, as requested.",
