    "execution_output": "The trip plan is designed to visit all six cities within the 16-day period while adhering to the constraints: 4 days in Mykonos, 3 days in Nice (including days 14 and 16 for the conference), 2 days in London, 3 days in Copenhagen, 5 days in Oslo (with at least one day between day 10 and day 14 for the meeting), and 4 days in Tallinn. The direct flights available are used to commute between cities, but flight details are not included in the output as per the requirement.\n\nAfter careful planning, the itinerary is structured as follows:\n- Start with Mykonos for 4 days (days 1-4).\n- Fly to Tallinn for 4 days (days 5-8), using the direct flight from Mykonos to London and then connecting via Copenhagen to Tallinn, but only city stays are listed.\n- Fly to Oslo for 5 days (days 9-13), ensuring at least one day (days 9-13) falls between day 10 and day 14 for the meeting.\n- Fly to Copenhagen for 3 days (days 14-16 is not possible as day 14 and 16 must be in Nice; instead, adjust to use days 14-16 for Nice, but Copenhagen needs 3 days). \n\nHowever, due to the mathematical impossibility of fitting 21 required city days (4+3+2+3+5+4) into 16 days, the itinerary prioritizes the fixed constraints (e.g., Nice on days 14 and 16) and adjusts the stays where possible. The provided JSON output reflects a feasible plan that meets most constraints, with Oslo reduced to 4 days to fit the timeline, and all cities visited.\n\nFinal itinerary in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-8\", \"place\": \"Tallinn\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-13\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-16\", \"place\": \"Nice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: London and Copenhagen are not included due to the day constraint, but the problem requires visiting all six cities. This output is provided as a best-effort solution given the impossible requirements. In practice, the total city days exceed the available days, making a perfect schedule unattainable. For a valid solution, the day requirements would need adjustment to sum to 16 or fewer.",
