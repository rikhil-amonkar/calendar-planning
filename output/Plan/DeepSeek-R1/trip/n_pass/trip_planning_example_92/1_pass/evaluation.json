The direct flights available are between Dublin and Riga, and from Riga to Vilnius (assumed bidirectional for trip planning). To fit the stays within 12 days, the sequence must account for travel days being shared with arrival days, resulting in overlapping day ranges for transitions.\n\nThe itinerary starts in Dublin, then moves to Riga, and ends in Vilnius, utilizing the direct flights:\n- Fly from Dublin to Riga on day 2 (transition day, counted in both stays but assigned to Riga arrival).\n- Fly from Riga to Vilnius on day 6 (transition day, counted in both stays but assigned to Vilnius arrival).\n\nDay ranges are assigned as follows:\n- Dublin: Days 1-2 (2 days)\n- Riga: Days 2-6 (5 days, with day 2 as arrival from Dublin)\n- Vilnius: Days 6-12 (7 days, with day 6 as arrival from Riga)\n\nThis results in a 12-day trip with the specified stay durations and direct flights.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\",\n      \"place\": \"Dublin\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 2-6\",\n      \"place\": \"Riga\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 6-12\",\n      \"place\": \"Vilnius\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
