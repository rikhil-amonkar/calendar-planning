    "execution_output": "The trip plan must satisfy the following constraints:\n- Total duration: 17 days.\n- Stay in Vilnius for 7 days.\n- Stay in Naples for 5 days, with the relatives visit occurring between day 1 and day 5, meaning the Naples stay must include at least one day within this range (days 1 to 5 inclusive).\n- Stay in Vienna for 7 days.\n- Direct flights are only available between Naples and Vienna, and between Vienna and Vilnius, requiring Vienna to be the hub for travel between Naples and Vilnius. The sequence must be Naples \u2192 Vienna \u2192 Vilnius or Vilnius \u2192 Vienna \u2192 Naples, but the Naples constraint forces Naples to be visited first to include days 1\u20135.\n\nGiven the stay durations (7 + 5 + 7 = 19) and the 17-day total, the transition days (when flying between cities) must be shared between the departure and arrival cities to cover all days without gaps. Specifically:\n- Start in Naples on day 1 for a 5-day stay (days 1\u20135).\n- Fly to Vienna on day 5 (direct flight available) and stay for 7 days (days 5\u201311, with day 5 shared).\n- Fly to Vilnius on day 11 (direct flight available) and stay for 7 days (days 11\u201317, with day 11 shared).\n\nThis results in the following itinerary:\n- Naples: Days 1\u20135 (5 days, includes days 1\u20135 for relatives visit).\n- Vienna: Days 5\u201311 (7 days).\n- Vilnius: Days 11\u201317 (7 days).\n\nThe shared days (5 and 11) are included in both adjacent city stays for the itinerary ranges, which is consistent with standard travel planning where arrival/departure days are counted in the stay. The JSON output lists the day ranges for each city visit without flight details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\",\n      \"place\": \"Naples\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 5-11\",\n      \"place\": \"Vienna\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 11-17\",\n      \"place\": \"Vilnius\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
