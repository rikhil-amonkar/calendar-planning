        "content": "The total stay durations specified (7 days in Reykjavik, 2 days in Riga, 3 days in Warsaw, 6 days in Istanbul, and 7 days in Krakow) sum to 25 days, but the total trip duration is only 21 days. This inconsistency suggests that it is impossible to satisfy all stay durations exactly within 21 days while adhering to the flight constraints and event requirements. However, after evaluating the constraints and flight connections, a feasible itinerary was found by reducing the stay in Krakow to 3 days, as this allows all other requirements to be met:\n\n- Riga must include a meeting between global day 1 and day 2, so it is scheduled for days 1-2.\n- Istanbul must include a wedding between global day 2 and day 7, and with a 6-day stay starting on day 3, it covers days 3-8, which includes days 3-7 (satisfying the wedding constraint, as day 3 is within days 2-7).\n- Warsaw is scheduled for 3 days, Krakow for 3 days (adjusted from 7 to fit the timeline), and Reykjavik for 7 days.\n- Flight connections are direct and valid: Riga to Istanbul, Istanbul to Warsaw, Warsaw to Krakow, and Krakow to Reykjavik via Warsaw (transit only, no additional stay).\n\nThe itinerary ensures all city visits are covered within 21 days, with day ranges reflecting the stays. The JSON output below includes the adjusted stay for Krakow.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-8\", \"place\": \"Istanbul\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-11\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-14\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-21\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
