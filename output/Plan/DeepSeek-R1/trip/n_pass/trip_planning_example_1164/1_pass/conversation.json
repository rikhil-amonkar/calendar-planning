        "content": "The trip plan satisfies all constraints: the total duration is 17 days, the stay durations match the requirements, the event constraints are met, and all consecutive cities have direct flights as per the given list. The flight days are counted for both the departure and arrival cities, so no separate flight entries are needed in the itinerary.\n\nThe itinerary in JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-5\", \"place\": \"Stockholm\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-7\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-8\", \"place\": \"Copenhagen\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Venice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-13\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-17\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Nice (3 days)**: Days 1-3.
