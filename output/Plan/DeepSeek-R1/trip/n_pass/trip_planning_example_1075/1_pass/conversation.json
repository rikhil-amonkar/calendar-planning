        "content": "It appears there is a mathematical impossibility in the given constraints. The sum of the required stay days for all 8 cities is 32 days (Vienna: 4, Lyon: 3, Edinburgh: 4, Reykjavik: 5, Stuttgart: 5, Manchester: 2, Split: 5, Prague: 4), but the total trip duration is only 25 days. This discrepancy of 7 days cannot be resolved even when accounting for travel days or flexible scheduling around the fixed events in Edinburgh (days 5-8) and Split (wedding between days 19-23).\n\nAfter extensive attempts to find a feasible itinerary that respects all stay durations, fixed events, and direct flight connections, no valid solution exists. The constraints lead to conflicts in scheduling, such as overlapping stays, insufficient days in available gaps, or missing direct flights for necessary transitions.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of providing a response, a partial itinerary is constructed using the direct flight connections and fixed events, but it does not include all cities or fully satisfy the stay durations due to the inherent contradiction. Reykjavik and Lyon are omitted to fit within 25 days, but this is not a complete or valid solution.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-8\", \"place\": \"Edinburgh\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-13\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-17\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 18-22\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 23-24\", \"place\": \"Manchester\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** This itinerary includes only 6 cities (Prague, Edinburgh, Stuttgart, Vienna, Split, Manchester) with a total of 22 stay days, omitting Lyon and Reykjavik. The flight from Vienna to Split is direct, and other transitions use available direct flights (Prague to Edinburgh, Edinburgh to Stuttgart, Stuttgart to Vienna, Split to Manchester). However, it does not meet the requirement to visit all 8 cities or spend the specified days in each. The underlying issue is the infeasibility of the initial constraints."
