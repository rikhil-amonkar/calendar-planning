This satisfies the 2-day requirement for Hamburg.\n- Fly from Hamburg to Budapest on Day 2. Since Day 2 is a travel day, it counts for both Hamburg and Budapest.\n- Stay in Budapest for 3 days (Day 2-4), including the travel day (Day 2) and the departure day to Mykonos (Day 4).\n- Fly from Budapest to Mykonos on Day 4. Day 4 counts for both Budapest and Mykonos.\n- Stay in Mykonos for 6 days (Day 4-9), including the arrival day (Day 4) and the conference days (Day 4 and Day 9).\n\nThis plan uses only the available direct flights and ensures all city day requirements are met:\n- Hamburg: 2 days (Day 1-2)\n- Budapest: 3 days (Day 2-4)\n- Mykonos: 6 days (Day 4-9)\n\nThe day ranges are inclusive, and travel days are incorporated into the city stays without separate entries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\",\n      \"place\": \"Hamburg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 2-4\",\n      \"place\": \"Budapest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 4-9\",\n      \"place\": \"Mykonos\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
