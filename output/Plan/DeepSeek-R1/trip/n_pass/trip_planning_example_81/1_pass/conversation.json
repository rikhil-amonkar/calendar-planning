During day 4 and day 9, you have to attend a conference in Mykonos. You would like to visit Budapest for 3 days. You want to spend 2 days in Hamburg.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBudapest and Mykonos, Hamburg and Budapest.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 9 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

Day 4 counts for both Budapest and Mykonos.\n- Stay in Mykonos for 6 days (Day 4-9), including the arrival day (Day 4) and the conference days (Day 4 and Day 9).\n\nThis plan uses only the available direct flights and ensures all city day requirements are met:\n- Hamburg: 2 days (Day 1-2)\n- Budapest: 3 days (Day 2-4)\n- Mykonos: 6 days (Day 4-9)\n\nThe day ranges are inclusive, and travel days are incorporated into the city stays without separate entries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\",\n      \"place\": \"Hamburg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 2-4\",\n      \"place\": \"Budapest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 4-9\",\n      \"place\": \"Mykonos\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
