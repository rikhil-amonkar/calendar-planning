        "content": "The given constraints and stay durations result in a total of 41 stay days, which exceeds the 32-day trip duration. This makes it impossible to satisfy all stay durations within the 32-day timeframe while accounting for travel days. After careful consideration, the trip plan below prioritizes the fixed constraints (Krakow on days 5-9 and Istanbul on days 25-29) and the direct flight connections, but it requires adjusting some stay durations to fit within 32 days. The stay durations for Hamburg, Oslo, Vilnius, and Munich are reduced to 3 days each to make the plan feasible, while other stays are kept as close as possible to the desired durations.\n\nThe itinerary is structured as follows:\n- Before Krakow: A short stay in Stockholm (days 1-3).\n- Krakow: Fixed workshop days (days 5-9).\n- Between Krakow and Istanbul: Visits to Vilnius, Oslo, and Frankfurt, with adjusted stays.\n- Istanbul: Fixed show days (days 25-29).\n- After Istanbul: A short stay in Santorini (days 30-31) and travel to Hamburg for the remaining days.\n\nFlights are direct and respect the given connections, but flight details are omitted as per the output requirement. The plan ensures all cities are visited, with day ranges covering the stays.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Stockholm\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-12\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-19\", \"place\": \"Frankfurt\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 20-21\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 22-24\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 25-29\", \"place\": \"Istanbul\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 30-31\", \"place\": \"Santorini\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 32\", \"place\": \"Hamburg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** \n- Hamburg is only for 1 day (day 32) instead of 5 days.\n- Oslo is for 3 days (days 13-15) instead of 5 days.\n- Vilnius is for 3 days (days 10-12) instead of 5 days.\n- Munich is for 3 days (days 22-24) instead of 5 days.\n- Florence is for 2 days (days 20-21), as desired.\n- Santorini is for 2 days (days 30-31), as desired.\n- The day ranges account for travel days (e.g., day 4 for travel from Stockholm to Krakow, day 32 for travel and partial stay in Hamburg).\n\nThis plan respects all direct flight connections and fixed date constraints but involves reduced stays for some cities to fit within 32 days. If full stay durations are required, the trip would need more than 32 days."
