        "content": "The trip plan must accommodate the fixed events in Reykjavik and Vilnius while fitting within the 12-day total and using only direct flights. The fixed constraints are:\n- Reykjavik must include one of days 10, 11, or 12 for the wedding, and the visit should be 3 days. The only feasible 3-day range ending by day 12 is days 10-12.\n- Vilnius must include one of days 7, 8, or 9 for the relatives visit, and the visit should be 3 days. To avoid overlap with Reykjavik and allow for travel, Vilnius is scheduled for days 7-9.\n- This leaves days 1-6 for Split, Helsinki, and Geneva. However, the desired days (Split: 2, Helsinki: 2, Geneva: 6) sum to 10 days, but only 6 days are available. To fit within 12 days, Geneva is reduced to 2 days, while Split and Helsinki each get 2 days.\n\nThe itinerary uses direct flights as follows:\n- Geneva to Split (direct flight exists).\n- Split to Helsinki (direct flight exists).\n- Helsinki to Vilnius (direct flight exists).\n- Vilnius to Helsinki (direct flight exists) and then Helsinki to Reykjavik (direct flight exists) on the same day (day 10) for efficiency.\n\nThe final plan in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Geneva\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-6\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-12\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
