Stuttgart is fixed on days 7-13 to include the conferences on day 7 and day 13. Bucharest must include a day between day 1 and day 6 for the wedding, and it is scheduled for days 1-4 to partially meet the desired 6-day visit.

Copenhagen and Dubrovnik are scheduled after Stuttgart, with Copenhagen for 3 days (days 14-16) to meet the desired duration, and Dubrovnik for 3 days (days 17-19), which is less than the desired 5 days but necessary due to the total day constraint.
