You want to spend 4 days in Naples. You would like to visit Helsinki for 4 days. From day 2 to day 5, there is a annual show you want to attend in Helsinki. You want to spend 3 days in Lyon. You want to spend 2 days in Prague. You have to attend a workshop in Prague between day 1 and day 2.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nPrague and Lyon, Prague and Frankfurt, Frankfurt and Lyon, Helsinki and Naples, Helsinki and Frankfurt, Naples and Frankfurt, Prague and Helsinki.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

The total days add up to 12 calendar days, with the sum of individual city days (16) minus the number of transfers (4) equaling 12.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\",\n      \"place\": \"Prague\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 2-5\",\n      \"place\": \"Helsinki\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 5-8\",\n      \"place\": \"Naples\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 8-10\",\n      \"place\": \"Frankfurt\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 10-12\",\n      \"place\": \"Lyon\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
