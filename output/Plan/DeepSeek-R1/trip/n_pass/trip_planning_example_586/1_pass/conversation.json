        "content": "The trip plan must satisfy the following constraints:\n- Total trip duration: 12 days (Day 1 to Day 12).\n- Must spend 3 days in Frankfurt.\n- Must spend 4 days in Naples.\n- Must spend 4 days in Helsinki, with the stay including Days 2 to 5 for the annual show.\n- Must spend 3 days in Lyon.\n- Must spend 2 days in Prague, with a workshop attended between Day 1 and Day 2.\n- Direct flights are available only between specific city pairs: Prague-Lyon, Prague-Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Lyon, Helsinki-Naples, Helsinki-Frankfurt, Naples-Frankfurt, Prague-Helsinki.\n- Flight days are not included in the itinerary output; only city stays with day ranges are shown.\n\nGiven the fixed events:\n- The workshop in Prague must occur on Day 1 (since Day 2 is occupied in Helsinki).\n- The annual show in Helsinki requires being in Helsinki on Days 2-5.\n\nTo fit all cities within 12 days while respecting the constraints and direct flight connections, the following itinerary is designed:\n- **Prague**: Occupies Day 1 for the workshop. Since only one day is available for Prague due to other constraints, the desired 2-day stay is not fully met, but the workshop requirement is satisfied.\n- **Helsinki**: Fixed on Days 2-5 for the show (4 days).\n- **Frankfurt**: 3 days needed; placed on Days 6-8.\n- **Lyon**: 3 days needed; placed on Days 9-11.\n- **Naples**: 4 days desired, but only one day (Day 12) is available after accommodating other cities. This is the only feasible option to visit all cities.\n\nThe sequence ensures direct flights are used for commuting:\n- Day 1 to Day 2: Fly from Prague to Helsinki (direct flight available).\n- Day 5 to Day 6: Fly from Helsinki to Frankfurt (direct flight available).\n- Day 8 to Day 9: Fly from Frankfurt to Lyon (direct flight available).\n- Day 11 to Day 12: Fly from Lyon to Naples via Frankfurt (direct flights: Lyon to Frankfurt, then Frankfurt to Naples).\n\nThe itinerary in the specified JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-5\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 6-8\", \"place\": \"Frankfurt\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-11\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12\", \"place\": \"Naples\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
