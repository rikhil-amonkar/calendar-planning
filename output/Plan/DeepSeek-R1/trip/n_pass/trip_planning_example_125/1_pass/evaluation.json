    "execution_output": "The trip plan must satisfy the following constraints:\n- Total days: 15\n- Visit Stuttgart for 6 days, with at least one day between day 1 and day 6 for meeting a friend.\n- Visit Seville for 7 days.\n- Visit Manchester for 4 days.\n- Only direct flights are available between Manchester and Seville, and between Stuttgart and Manchester. There is no direct flight between Stuttgart and Seville, so travel between them must go through Manchester.\n- Flight days are counted for both the departure and arrival cities, meaning the day of travel is included in the stay for both cities.\n- Each city must be visited in one continuous block, as the output format requires a single day range per city.\n\nGiven the flight constraints and the requirement to meet in Stuttgart between day 1 and day 6, the only feasible sequence is:\n- Start in Stuttgart for 6 days (days 1\u20136), which includes the meeting day (day 6 is within days 1\u20136).\n- Fly directly from Stuttgart to Manchester on day 6 (this day is counted in both Stuttgart and Manchester stays).\n- Stay in Manchester for 4 days (days 6\u20139).\n- Fly directly from Manchester to Seville on day 9 (this day is counted in both Manchester and Seville stays).\n- Stay in Seville for 7 days (days 9\u201315).\n\nThis plan uses the available direct flights and ensures the total days add to 15, with overlapping flight days accounted for. The day ranges are continuous for each city, and no separate flight entries are included in the JSON.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-6\",\n      \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 6-9\",\n      \"place\": \"Manchester\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 9-15\",\n      \"place\": \"Seville\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
