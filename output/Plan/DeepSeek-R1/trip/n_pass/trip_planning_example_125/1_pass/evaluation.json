    "execution_output": "The trip plan must satisfy the following constraints:\n- Total of 15 days.\n- Visit Stuttgart for 6 days, with a meeting between day 1 and day 6.\n- Visit Seville for 7 days.\n- Visit Manchester for 4 days.\n- Direct flights are only available between Manchester and Seville, and between Stuttgart and Manchester. Since there is no direct flight between Stuttgart and Seville, the itinerary must go through Manchester, with Manchester in the middle of the sequence.\n\nThe only feasible sequence that meets all constraints is:\n- Start in Stuttgart for 6 days (days 1-6), satisfying the meeting constraint as it includes days 1-6.\n- Then fly directly to Manchester for 4 days. The flight occurs on day 6, so Manchester starts on day 6, resulting in a day range of days 6-9 (with day 6 shared as the transition day).\n- Then fly directly to Seville for 7 days. The flight occurs on day 9, so Seville starts on day 9, resulting in a day range of days 9-15 (with day 9 shared as the transition day).\n\nThis uses 15 calendar days, with the stay days summing to 17 (6 + 4 + 7) due to two transition days (day 6 and day 9) being shared between cities, accounting for the 15-day total.\n\nThe itinerary in the specified JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-6\",\n      \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 6-9\",\n      \"place\": \"Manchester\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 9-15\",\n      \"place\": \"Seville\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
