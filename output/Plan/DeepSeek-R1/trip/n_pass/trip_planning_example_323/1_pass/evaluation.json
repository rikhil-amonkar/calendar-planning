    "execution_output": "The trip plan must satisfy the given constraints while adhering to the direct flight connections. The key constraints are:\n\n- Total trip duration: 16 days.\n- Stay in Split for 5 days, including the annual show from day 7 to day 11. Therefore, Split must be occupied from day 7 to day 11.\n- Stay in London for 7 days, with at least some days between day 1 and day 7 to visit relatives.\n- Stay in Oslo for 2 days.\n- Stay in Porto for 5 days.\n- Direct flights are available only between: London and Oslo, Split and Oslo, Oslo and Porto, and London and Split. There is no direct flight between London and Porto or between Split and Porto, so travel between these pairs must go through Oslo.\n\nGiven the fixed Split stay from day 7 to day 11, the available days for the other cities are days 1\u20136 and days 12\u201316 (11 days total). However, London requires 7 days, Oslo 2 days, and Porto 5 days, summing to 14 days, which exceeds the 11 available days. This indicates that London cannot be accommodated for the full 7 days while satisfying all other constraints.\n\nAfter exploring various itineraries, the only feasible plan that meets all mandatory constraints (Split fixed, relatives visit in London between days 1\u20137, and direct flight connections) with the given stay preferences is:\n\n- London: Days 1\u20134 (4 days, satisfying the relatives visit between days 1\u20137).\n- Oslo: Days 5\u20136 (2 days).\n- Split: Days 7\u201311 (5 days, fixed for the show).\n- Porto: Days 12\u201316 (5 days).\n\nThis itinerary uses all 16 days and respects the flight connections:\n- From London to Oslo: Direct flight exists.\n- From Oslo to Split: Direct flight exists.\n- From Split to Porto: No direct flight, so travel via Oslo on day 12 is required. However, this transit is not included in the itinerary output, as per the instructions.\n- London is only 4 days instead of the desired 7, but this is necessary due to the day constraints. The relatives visit is covered within days 1\u20134.\n\nThe JSON output below includes the day ranges for each city visit, with no flight information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"London\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-6\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-11\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-16\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
