        "content": "The constraints provided\u201418 total days, 6 days in Split, 7 days in Santorini (with a conference from day 12 to day 18 inclusive), and 7 days in London\u2014result in a conflict because the required stay days (6 + 7 + 7 = 20) exceed the 18 available days. After exploring various itineraries, the only feasible plan that respects the conference requirement and direct flight connections (London-Santorini and Split-London) is as follows:\n\n- Santorini must occupy days 12 to 18 for the 7-day stay, including the conference days.\n- The remaining days (1 to 11) must accommodate Split and London stays. However, 11 days are insufficient for both the required 6 days in Split and 7 days in London.\n- The itinerary below prioritizes the conference and direct flight constraints, resulting in a 5-day stay in London instead of 7, as a full 7 days cannot be achieved within the 18-day limit without violating other constraints.\n\n**Itinerary in JSON format:**\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-6\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-11\", \"place\": \"London\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-18\", \"place\": \"Santorini\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Split (Day 1-6):** 6-day stay, starting on day 1.\n- **London (Day 7-11):** 5-day stay. This is less than the desired 7 days due to the day limit, but it allows for a direct flight from Split to London.\n- **Santorini (Day 12-18):** 7-day stay, including the conference from day 12 to day 18. A direct flight from London to Santorini is used on day 12.\n- Flights are not included in the JSON, as per the requirement.\n\nThis plan uses the available direct flights: a flight from Split to London between day 6 and 7, and a flight from London to Santorini between day 11 and 12. The London stay is shorter than requested, but it is the maximum possible given the constraints. If the 7-day London stay is inflexible, the input constraints may need revisiting."
