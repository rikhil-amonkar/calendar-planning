You plan to stay in Santorini for 7 days. During day 12 and day 18, you have to attend a conference in Santorini. You want to spend 7 days in London.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nLondon and Santorini, Split and London.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 18 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

        "content": "The trip plan must satisfy the following constraints:\n- Total days: 18\n- 6 days in Split\n- 7 days in Santorini, including Day 12 and Day 18 for a conference\n- 7 days in London\n- Direct flights only between London and Santorini, and between Split and London (no direct flight between Split and Santorini)\n- Flight days are counted for both the departure and arrival cities (e.g., if flying from A to B on Day X, Day X is included in the stay for both A and B)\n- No separate flight entries in the itinerary\n\nGiven the flight constraints, the only feasible sequence is to start in Split (since it connects only to London), then fly to London, and finally fly to Santorini (ending there to satisfy the Day 18 conference requirement). The sequence Santorini \u2192 London \u2192 Split is not possible because it would end in Split, violating the Day 18 conference in Santorini.\n\nThe itinerary is as follows:\n- **Split**: Days 1 to 6 (6 days). This includes Day 6, which is the flight day to London.\n- **London**: Days 6 to 12 (7 days). Day 6 is the arrival day from Split, and Day 12 is the departure day to Santorini (both days counted for London).\n- **Santorini**: Days 12 to 18 (7 days). Day 12 is the arrival day from London, and Day 18 is the end day (both conference days covered).\n\nThis plan uses the required direct flights:\n- Split to London on Day 6 (direct flight available)\n- London to Santorini on Day 12 (direct flight available)\n\nThe JSON output below represents the itinerary with city visits and day ranges, without separate flight entries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-6\",\n      \"place\": \"Split\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 6-12\",\n      \"place\": \"London\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 12-18\",\n      \"place\": \"Santorini\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
