The key fixed points are:\n- Dubrovnik must include days 2-4 for the annual show.\n- Oslo must include day 1 or 2 for the meeting with friends; here, it is set for day 1.\n- Mykonos must be between days 15-18 for 4 days.\n\nThe total days sum to 18, with the stays adjusted to fit within the 18-day period while respecting the flight connections. The itinerary is as follows:\n\n- Days 1-2: Oslo (includes day 1 for the meeting; the second day is part of the stay, but note that day 2 involves travel to Dubrovnik).\n- Days 2-4: Dubrovnik (arrive on day 2 for the show; the stay includes days 2, 3, and 4).\n- Days 5-6: Helsinki (2-day stay).\n- Days 7-8: Vilnius (2-day stay; direct flight from Helsinki).\n- Days 9-13: Krakow (5-day stay; direct flight from Vilnius).\n- Days 14-18: Madrid (5-day stay; direct flight from Krakow via Paris or other connections, but flight not included in output).\n- Days 15-18: Mykonos (4-day stay within 15-18; fly from Madrid on day 15, but flight not included).\n\nNote: Mykonos is only reachable from Madrid, so the trip to Mykonos starts from Madrid on day 15. The stay in Madrid ends on day 14, and Mykonos begins on day 15. Paris is not included in this itinerary due to time constraints and to prioritize the fixed requirements.\n\nThe JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-4\", \"place\": \"Dubrovnik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-6\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-8\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-13\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-18\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-18\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
