        "content": "The constraints and stay durations provided (summing to 37 days) exceed the 28-day total trip duration, making it impossible to satisfy all requirements within the given timeframe while accounting for travel days or even with instantaneous travel. Despite this, the itinerary below is constructed to adhere to the fixed constraints (Riga days 5-8 for the show, Tallinn including one day between 18-20 for relatives, and Milan including one day between 24-26 for the friend meet) and the direct flight connections. The stay durations are adjusted to fit the 28-day window, prioritizing the fixed date ranges and flight connectivity. The day ranges are assigned based on a feasible path using the direct flights, with the understanding that the total stay days are compressed to fit the 28 days.\n\n**Itinerary in JSON format:**\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-8\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-10\", \"place\": \"Stockholm\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-15\", \"place\": \"Santorini\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-20\", \"place\": \"Naples\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21-23\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 24-26\", \"place\": \"Milan\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 27-28\", \"place\": \"Lisbon\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Warsaw (2 days)**: Days 1-2. Connected to Prague (direct flight).\n- **Prague (5 days adjusted to 2 days)**: Days 3-4. Adjusted to fit; connected to Riga (direct flight).\n- **Riga (4 days)**: Days 5-8 (fixed for the show). Connected to Stockholm (direct flight).\n- **Stockholm (2 days)**: Days 9-10. Connected to Santorini (direct flight).\n- **Santorini (5 days)**: Days 11-15. Connected to Naples (direct flight via Santorini and Naples).\n- **Naples (5 days)**: Days 16-20. Includes day 20 for Tallinn relatives constraint overlap; connected to Porto via Warsaw or other, but here connected to Porto indirectly, but Naples to Porto not direct; adjusted path: Naples to Milan not used here, but Naples connected to Lisbon (direct), but Lisbon placed later. Instead, from Naples, fly to Porto via Warsaw or other, but for simplicity, Porto is next with direct flight from Lisbon not used. Revision: After Naples, fly to Porto (direct flight not listed; Naples connected to Warsaw, Milan, Lisbon). To fix, from Santorini, fly to Milan first? But Milan is later. Instead, after Stockholm, fly to Lisbon? But Lisbon to Santorini not direct. Path used: Stockholm to Santorini direct, Santorini to Naples direct, then Naples to Porto not direct\u2014connect via another city. However, in the itinerary, Porto is placed after Naples with an assumed connection, but flight exists from Naples to Warsaw, then Warsaw to Porto. Adjusted: Days 16-20 Naples, then on day 21 fly to Porto via Warsaw (Naples to Warsaw direct, Warsaw to Porto direct).\n- **Porto (3 days)**: Days 21-23. Connected to Milan (direct flight).\n- **Milan (3 days)**: Days 24-26 (fixed for friend meet). Connected to Lisbon (direct flight).\n- **Lisbon (5 days adjusted to 2 days)**: Days 27-28. Adjusted to fit.\n\n**Note on missing cities and adjustments:**\n- Tallinn and its 3-day stay (with relatives between days 18-20) could not be included due to time and connectivity constraints in this compressed schedule. Similarly, the stay durations for Prague and Lisbon were reduced from 5 to 2 days to fit the 28-day limit, and Tallinn was omitted to prioritize fixed date ranges and flight paths.\n- This itinerary uses the direct flight connections where possible, but the path involves some indirect hops (e.g., Naples to Porto via Warsaw) to maintain connectivity.\n- The sum of stay days is 2 (Warsaw) + 2 (Prague) + 4 (Riga) + 2 (Stockholm) + 5 (Santorini) + 5 (Naples) + 3 (Porto) + 3 (Milan) + 2 (Lisbon) = 28 days, with no travel days accounted for (flights assumed to not consume full days).\n\nThis plan is a best-effort compromise given the constraints, but it does not fully satisfy all stay durations or include all cities (Tallinn is missing). For a feasible trip, consider increasing the total days or reducing stay durations."
