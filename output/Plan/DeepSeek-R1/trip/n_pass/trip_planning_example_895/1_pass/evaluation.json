    "execution_output": "The constraints and city stay requirements cannot all be satisfied simultaneously with the given 17-day total and fixed events. Specifically, the sum of the required stay days (Brussels 2, Venice 3, London 3, Lisbon 4, Reykjavik 3, Santorini 3, Madrid 5) is 23 days, which exceeds the 17-day trip duration. After accounting for the fixed stays in Brussels (days 1-2) and Madrid (days 7-11), only 10 days remain for the other 5 cities, but they require a total of 16 days, making it impossible.\n\nHowever, to provide a feasible itinerary that respects the fixed constraints and direct flight connections as much as possible, the following plan is proposed:\n- Brussels is fixed on days 1-2 for the conference.\n- Venice must include a day between 5 and 7 for the relatives visit. It is placed on days 4-6 to include days 5 and 6, avoiding conflict with Madrid on day 7.\n- Madrid is fixed on days 7-11 for the wedding.\n- The remaining days (12-17) are used for London, Santorini, and Reykjavik, but Lisbon is omitted due to insufficient days and connectivity constraints.\n- Reykjavik is visited for 3 days, but the directed flight from Reykjavik to Madrid is not used in this sequence.\n- The itinerary uses direct flights between the cities as per the connections: Brussels to Venice, Venice to Madrid, Madrid to London, London to Santorini, and Santorini to Reykjavik (assuming bidirectional for planning).\n\nThe resulting itinerary in the specified JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Brussels\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-6\", \"place\": \"Venice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-11\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-14\", \"place\": \"London\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-17\", \"place\": \"Santorini\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** This plan does not include Lisbon or Reykjavik due to the day count inconsistency, and Venice is only 3 days including relatives on day 5 or 6. The fixed constraints for Brussels and Madrid are satisfied, and the flight connections are valid. The sum of stay days in this itinerary is 2 (Brussels) + 3 (Venice) + 5 (Madrid) + 3 (London) + 3 (Santorini) = 16 days, with day 3 unused or for travel, but not included in the JSON as per the requirement to only output city visits. For a complete solution, the problem constraints may need revision.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Brussels\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-6\", \"place\": \"Venice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-11\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-14\", \"place\": \"London\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-17\", \"place\": \"Santorini\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
