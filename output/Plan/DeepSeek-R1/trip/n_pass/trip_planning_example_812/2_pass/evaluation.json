    "execution_output": "After careful revision to address the gap between Day 7 and Day 8, the itinerary has been adjusted to ensure all flight days are properly counted for both departure and arrival cities. The key changes are:\n\n1. **Paris stay extended to Day 8**: The flight to Florence now occurs on Day 8, so Day 8 is counted for both Paris and Florence, eliminating the gap.\n2. **Florence stay adjusted to include Day 11**: The flight to Munich occurs on Day 11, so Day 11 is counted for both Florence and Munich.\n3. **Warsaw stay extended to Day 16**: The flight to Nice occurs on Day 16, so Day 16 is counted for both Warsaw and Nice.\n4. **Nice stay adjusted to include Day 19**: The flight to Vienna occurs on Day 19, so Day 19 is counted for both Nice and Vienna.\n\nThe revised plan meets all fixed commitments (Porto workshop on Day 2, Warsaw wedding on Day 15) and uses only available direct flights. However, due to the 20-day constraint, the minimum stay durations for Munich, Nice, and Vienna could not be fully met:\n- Munich: 3 days (below 5-day requirement)\n- Nice: 4 days (below 5-day requirement)\n- Vienna: 2 days (below 3-day requirement)\n\nAll other cities meet or exceed their minimum stay requirements.\n\n### Revised Itinerary:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-8\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-13\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-16\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Flight Details:\n- **Porto \u2192 Paris** on Day 3 (counts for both Porto and Paris)\n- **Paris \u2192 Florence** on Day 8 (counts for both Paris and Florence)\n- **Florence \u2192 Munich** on Day 11 (counts for both Florence and Munich)\n- **Munich \u2192 Warsaw** on Day 13 (counts for both Munich and Warsaw)\n- **Warsaw \u2192 Nice** on Day 16 (counts for both Warsaw and Nice)\n- **Nice \u2192 Vienna** on Day 19 (counts for both Nice and Vienna)\n\nThis plan ensures continuous coverage with no gaps or overlaps between cities, adhering to the rule that flight days count for both departure and arrival cities. The compromises on stay durations are necessary due to the 20-day limit and fixed commitments.",
