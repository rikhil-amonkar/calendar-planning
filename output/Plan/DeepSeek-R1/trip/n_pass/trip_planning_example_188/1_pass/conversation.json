During day 1 and day 2, you have to attend a conference in Brussels. You want to spend 5 days in Split. You plan to stay in Barcelona for 7 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nBrussels and Barcelona, Barcelona and Split.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

        "content": "The trip plan must satisfy the following constraints:\n- Total of 12 days.\n- Spend exactly 2 days in Brussels, with the conference on Day 1 and Day 2.\n- Spend exactly 5 days in Split.\n- Spend exactly 7 days in Barcelona.\n- Direct flights exist only between Brussels and Barcelona, and between Barcelona and Split. Therefore, travel must go through Barcelona when moving between Brussels and Split.\n- Flight days are counted for both the departure and arrival cities, meaning day ranges overlap on transition days.\n- No separate flight entries in the itinerary; only city stays with day ranges.\n\nGiven that the conference requires being in Brussels on Day 1 and Day 2, Brussels must start on Day 1. To achieve exactly 2 days in Brussels, the stay must end on Day 2 (since a range of Day 1-2 covers 2 days). This means flying out of Brussels on Day 2 to Barcelona (the only direct flight option).\n\nAfter flying to Barcelona on Day 2, Barcelona starts on Day 2. Spending 7 days in Barcelona requires a range ending on Day 8 (Day 2 to Day 8 inclusive is 7 days: Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).\n\nThen, flying to Split on Day 8 (direct flight exists) means Split starts on Day 8. Spending 5 days in Split requires a range ending on Day 12 (Day 8 to Day 12 inclusive is 5 days: Days 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).\n\nThe itinerary covers 12 unique days (Day 1 to Day 12), with overlaps on Day 2 (Brussels and Barcelona) and Day 8 (Barcelona and Split). The day ranges account for the required days in each city:\n- Brussels: 2 days (Day 1-2)\n- Barcelona: 7 days (Day 2-8)\n- Split: 5 days (Day 8-12)\n\nThis plan uses only direct flights as specified and meets all constraints.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\",\n      \"place\": \"Brussels\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 2-8\",\n      \"place\": \"Barcelona\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 8-12\",\n      \"place\": \"Split\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
