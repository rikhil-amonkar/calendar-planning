    "execution_output": "The trip must span 12 days, with specific constraints: Brussels must be visited on days 1 and 2 for a conference, Split should be visited for 5 days, and Barcelona for 7 days. However, the total days required (2 + 5 + 7 = 14) exceed the available 12 days, making it impossible to satisfy all duration requirements simultaneously. Given the flight constraints (only direct flights between Brussels and Barcelona, and Barcelona and Split), the itinerary prioritizes the fixed Brussels days and the planned 7-day stay in Barcelona, resulting in a 3-day stay in Split to fit within the 12-day limit.\n\nThe itinerary is structured as follows:\n- Start in Brussels for days 1-2 to attend the conference.\n- Fly directly to Barcelona on day 3 and stay for 7 days (days 3-9).\n- Fly directly to Split on day 10 and stay for 3 days (days 10-12).\n\nThis plan uses the available direct flights and ensures all cities are visited within the 12-day period, with Barcelona receiving the planned 7-day stay, Brussels the required 2 days, and Split a reduced 3-day visit due to the day limit.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Brussels\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-9\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-12\", \"place\": \"Split\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
