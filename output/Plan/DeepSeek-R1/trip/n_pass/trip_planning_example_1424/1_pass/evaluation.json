    "execution_output": "After analyzing the constraints and available direct flights, a feasible 27-day itinerary that visits all 10 cities while adhering to the fixed events and direct flight requirements has been determined. The itinerary is structured as follows:\n\n- **Porto (5 days)**: Must include the workshop between days 1-5. The stay is set from day 1 to day 5.\n- **Amsterdam (4 days)**: Must include the visit to relatives between days 5-8. The stay starts on day 5 (same day as departure from Porto) and ends on day 8.\n- **Helsinki (4 days)**: Must include the wedding between days 8-11. The stay starts on day 8 (same day as departure from Amsterdam) and ends on day 11.\n- **Reykjavik (5 days)**: No fixed dates. Flown to directly from Helsinki on day 11, with a stay from day 11 to day 15.\n- **Warsaw (3 days)**: No fixed dates. Flown to directly from Reykjavik on day 15, with a stay from day 15 to day 17.\n- **Naples (4 days)**: Must include the conference between days 17-20. The stay starts on day 17 (same day as departure from Warsaw) and ends on day 20.\n- **Brussels (3 days)**: Must include the annual show between days 20-22. The stay starts on day 20 (same day as departure from Naples) and ends on day 22.\n- **Lyon (3 days)**: No fixed dates. Flown to directly from Brussels on day 22, with a stay from day 22 to day 24.\n- **Valencia (2 days)**: No fixed dates. Flown to directly from Lyon on day 24, with a stay from day 24 to day 25. Departure on day 25 allows for travel to the next city.\n- **Split (3 days)**: No fixed dates. Flown to directly from Valencia on day 25, with a stay from day 25 to day 27. The trip ends in Split on day 27.\n\n### Direct Flight Verification:\n- Helsinki to Reykjavik: Direct flight available (Helsinki and Reykjavik).\n- Reykjavik to Warsaw: Direct flight available (Reykjavik and Warsaw).\n- Warsaw to Naples: Direct flight available (Warsaw and Naples).\n- Naples to Brussels: Direct flight available (Naples and Brussels).\n- Brussels to Lyon: Direct flight available (Brussels and Lyon).\n- Lyon to Valencia: Direct flight available (Valencia and Lyon).\n- Valencia to Split: Direct flight available (Naples and Split, but since Split has a direct flight from Valencia via Naples? Correction: Direct flights include \"Lyon and Split\" and \"Valencia and Lyon\", but not directly from Valencia to Split. However, \"Naples and Split\" is direct, but we are not going through Naples here. Rechecking: The direct flight list includes \"Split and Lyon\" (LYS and SPU), but not Valencia to Split. Therefore, a direct flight from Valencia to Split is not available. This requires adjustment.\n\n### Adjustment for Valencia to Split:\nSince there is no direct flight from Valencia to Split, the itinerary must be adjusted. An alternative path is used:\n- From Lyon, fly directly to Split (Lyon and Split direct flight available).\n- Then, from Split, fly directly to Valencia? But no direct flight. Instead, after Lyon, go to Valencia first, then to another city with a direct flight to Split. But time is limited.\n\nAlternative path:\n- After Brussels, go to Lyon (day 22-24).\n- From Lyon, fly directly to Warsaw? But Warsaw is already visited. Not possible.\n- Or from Lyon to Split directly (available), then from Split to Valencia? No direct flight.\n\nRevised plan for the end:\n- After Brussels (day 22), fly to Valencia directly (Brussels and Valencia direct).\n- Stay in Valencia from day 22 to 23 (2 days: day 22 and 23).\n- On day 23, fly to Lyon (Valencia and Lyon direct).\n- Stay in Lyon from day 23 to 25 (3 days: day 23, 24, 25).\n- On day 25, fly to Split (Lyon and Split direct).\n- Stay in Split from day 25 to 27 (3 days: day 25, 26, 27).\n\nBut now Reykjavik is not included in this sequence. Reykjavik must be placed earlier.\n\n### Final Itinerary with All Cities:\nAfter careful re-routing, the following itinerary works with all direct flights and respects the day constraints:\n\n- **Day 1-5: Porto**  \n  Workshop attended between days 1-5.\n- **Day 5-8: Amsterdam**  \n  Relatives visited between days 5-8. Fly directly from Porto to Amsterdam on day 5.\n- **Day 8-11: Helsinki**  \n  Wedding attended between days 8-11. Fly directly from Amsterdam to Helsinki on day 8.\n- **Day 11-15: Reykjavik**  \n  Fly directly from Helsinki to Reykjavik on day 11.\n- **Day 15-17: Warsaw**  \n  Fly directly from Reykjavik to Warsaw on day 15.\n- **Day 17-20: Naples**  \n  Conference attended between days 17-20. Fly directly from Warsaw to Naples on day 17.\n- **Day 20-22: Brussels**  \n  Annual show attended between days 20-22. Fly directly from Naples to Brussels on day 20.\n- **Day 22-23: Valencia**  \n  Fly directly from Brussels to Valencia on day 22. Stay for 2 days (day 22 and 23).\n- **Day 23-25: Lyon**  \n  Fly directly from Valencia to Lyon on day 23. Stay for 3 days (day 23, 24, 25).\n- **Day 25-27: Split**  \n  Fly directly from Lyon to Split on day 25. Stay for 3 days (day 25, 26, 27).\n\n### Direct Flight Confirmation:\n- Porto to Amsterdam: Available (Porto and Amsterdam).\n- Amsterdam to Helsinki: Available (Amsterdam and Helsinki).\n- Helsinki to Reykjavik: Available (Helsinki and Reykjavik).\n- Reykjavik to Warsaw: Available (Reykjavik and Warsaw).\n- Warsaw to Naples: Available (Warsaw and Naples).\n- Naples to Brussels: Available (Naples and Brussels).\n- Brussels to Valencia: Available (Brussels and Valencia).\n- Valencia to Lyon: Available (Valencia and Lyon).\n- Lyon to Split: Available (Lyon and Split).\n\nThis plan respects all fixed events, uses only direct flights, and allocates the correct number of days for each city. The flight days are counted in both the departure and arrival cities as required.\n\n### JSON Output:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-8\", \"place\": \"Amsterdam\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-15\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-17\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-20\", \"place\": \"Naples\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 20-22\", \"place\": \"Brussels\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 22-23\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 23-25\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 25-27\", \"place\": \"Split\"}\n  ]\n}",
