    "execution_output": "Based on the constraints provided, it is not possible to spend exactly 2 days in Krakow (including the wedding on days 9-10), 7 days in Dubrovnik, and 3 days in Frankfurt within a 10-day trip, as the total minimum days required (2 + 7 + 3 = 12) exceeds the 10-day trip duration. However, a feasible itinerary can be created by adjusting the stay in Frankfurt to 1 day to fit within the 10 days while prioritizing the fixed wedding in Krakow on days 9-10 and the 7-day stay in Dubrovnik. The itinerary uses direct flights as specified (Frankfurt-Krakow and Dubrovnik-Frankfurt) for commuting between cities.\n\nThe trip plan is as follows:\n- Spend days 1-7 in Dubrovnik (7 days).\n- On day 8, fly directly from Dubrovnik to Frankfurt and spend the day in Frankfurt (1 day).\n- On day 9, fly directly from Frankfurt to Krakow and spend days 9-10 in Krakow (2 days, including the wedding between day 9 and day 10).\n\nThis plan ensures all city visits are covered within the 10-day trip using only direct flights. Flight details are omitted from the JSON output as requested.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-7\", \"place\": \"Dubrovnik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-8\", \"place\": \"Frankfurt\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-10\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
