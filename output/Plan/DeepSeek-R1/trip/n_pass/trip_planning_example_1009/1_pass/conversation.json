The fixed events are:\n- Istanbul must include days 12-13 for the annual show.\n- Bucharest must include days 16-19 for the workshop.\n\nThe itinerary is designed such that flight days are shared between consecutive cities (e.g., when flying from city A to city B on day X, day X is counted as part of the stay in both cities). The plan ensures all city visits are contiguous and meet the required durations.\n\nThe itinerary in JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-12\", \"place\": \"Manchester\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-13\", \"place\": \"Istanbul\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-16\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-19\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 20-23\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Itinerary:\n- **Reykjavik (4 days)**: Days 1-4.
