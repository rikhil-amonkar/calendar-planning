    "execution_output": "The trip plan is designed to visit all 8 cities within the 23-day period, respecting the fixed events in Istanbul (days 12-13) and Bucharest (days 16-19), and the direct flight connections. The itinerary ensures that the stay durations are as specified, with the sequence of cities connected by direct flights.\n\n- Days 1-5: Start in Manchester (5 days), connected to multiple cities.\n- Days 6-9: Fly to Riga (4 days); direct flight from Manchester to Riga.\n- Days 10-11: Fly to Vienna (2 days); direct flight from Riga to Vienna.\n- Days 12-13: Fly to Istanbul (2 days); direct flight from Vienna to Istanbul, attending the annual show.\n- Days 14-15: Fly to Stuttgart (2 days of the planned 5 days; adjusted to fit timeline); direct flight from Istanbul to Stuttgart. (Note: Stuttgart is planned for 5 days, but due to time constraints, it is shortened to 2 days here to accommodate the fixed events. The remaining 3 days are scheduled later.)\n- Days 16-19: Fly to Bucharest (4 days); direct flight from Stuttgart to Bucharest, attending the workshop.\n- Days 20-23: Fly to Reykjavik (4 days); direct flight from Bucharest to Reykjavik is not listed, but Reykjavik is connected to Stuttgart and Vienna. From Bucharest, fly to Vienna (not stayed, transit), then to Reykjavik; direct flights Bucharest-Vienna and Vienna-Reykjavik.\n\nFlorence is not included in this itinerary due to the tight schedule and the 23-day constraint. The stay in Stuttgart is split and shortened to fit, with only 2 days initially (days 14-15), and the remaining time is not used for Stuttgart as the 5-day requirement cannot be fully met. The direct flight connections are utilized for all transitions.\n\nThe JSON output below reflects the actual stays with day ranges, excluding flight information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Manchester\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 6-9\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-11\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-13\", \"place\": \"Istanbul\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-15\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-19\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 20-23\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Florence and the full 5 days for Stuttgart could not be accommodated within the 23-day limit while respecting all fixed events and direct flight connections. The itinerary prioritizes the fixed events and the specified durations where possible, but adjustments were necessary due to the mathematical impossibility of fitting all requested stay durations (summing to 30 days) into 23 days.",
