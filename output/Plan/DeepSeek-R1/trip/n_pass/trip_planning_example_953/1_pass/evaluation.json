Venice is visited from Day 1 to Day 5 to attend the annual show. Salzburg is only connected to Frankfurt, so the Frankfurt stay is split into two parts to accommodate the Salzburg visit, with direct flights between them. The day of flight is counted for both the departure and arrival cities, as per the instructions.\n\nThe JSON output includes all city visits with their day ranges, and no separate flight entries are included.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Venice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5\", \"place\": \"Frankfurt\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-8\", \"place\": \"Salzburg\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-10\", \"place\": \"Frankfurt\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-11\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-14\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-16\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-18\", \"place\": \"Stockholm\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the sequence and flights:**\n- **Day 1-5: Venice** - Start of the trip, covering the annual show.\n- **Day 5: Fly to Frankfurt** - Direct flight from Venice to Frankfurt (connection exists).\n- **Day 5: Frankfurt** - Short stay; fly to Salzburg on the same day.\n- **Day 5-8: Salzburg** - Direct flight from Frankfurt to Salzburg (connection exists); stay for 4 days.\n- **Day 8: Fly to Frankfurt** - Direct flight from Salzburg to Frankfurt (connection exists).\n- **Day 8-10: Frankfurt** - Second part of the Frankfurt stay; total Frankfurt days = 1 (Day 5) + 3 (Day 8-10) = 4 days.\n- **Day 10: Fly to Barcelona** - Direct flight from Frankfurt to Barcelona (connection exists).\n- **Day 10-11: Barcelona** - Stay for 2 days; fly to Florence on Day 11.\n- **Day 11: Fly to Florence** - Direct flight from Barcelona to Florence (connection exists).\n- **Day 11-14: Florence** - Stay for 4 days; fly to Stuttgart via Frankfurt on Day 14 (no direct flight, but connections via Frankfurt are used; not listed in JSON).\n- **Day 14: Fly to Stuttgart (via Frankfurt)** - Direct flight from Florence to Frankfurt (connection exists), then direct flight from Frankfurt to Stuttgart (connection exists); same day arrival in Stuttgart.\n- **Day 14-16: Stuttgart** - Stay for 3 days; fly to Stockholm on Day 17.\n- **Day 17: Fly to Stockholm** - Direct flight from Stuttgart to Stockholm (connection exists).\n- **Day 17-18: Stockholm** - Stay for 2 days; trip ends on Day 18.\n\nAll stay lengths are met: Venice (5 days), Salzburg (4 days), Frankfurt (4 days total), Florence (4 days), Barcelona (2 days), Stuttgart (3 days), Stockholm (2 days).
