However, the sum of the requested stay durations (Helsinki 4 days, Valencia 5 days, Dubrovnik 4 days, Porto 3 days, Prague 3 days, Reykjavik 4 days) is 23 days, which exceeds the 18-day total. To resolve this, the stay durations have been adjusted to fit within the 18-day constraint while prioritizing the fixed constraints: Porto must include days 16-18 for the meeting, and all cities are visited with direct flights.\n\nThe adjusted stays are:\n- Dubrovnik: 3 days (reduced from 4)\n- Helsinki: 3 days (reduced from 4)\n- Reykjavik: 3 days (reduced from 4)\n- Prague: 3 days (as specified)\n- Valencia: 3 days (reduced from 5)\n- Porto: 3 days (as specified)\n\nThe itinerary uses the following direct flight path:\n- Dubrovnik to Helsinki (direct flight available)\n- Helsinki to Reykjavik (direct flight available)\n- Reykjavik to Prague (direct flight available)\n- Prague to Valencia (direct flight available)\n- Valencia to Porto (direct flight available)\n\nThe day ranges are consecutive, with travel occurring on the transition days (not included in the output).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Dubrovnik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-6\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-12\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-18\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n  ]\n}\n```"
