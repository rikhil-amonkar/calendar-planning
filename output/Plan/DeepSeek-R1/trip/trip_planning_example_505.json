            "raw_model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this trip planning problem. The user wants to visit 5 European cities in 8 days using only direct flights. The cities are Prague, Stuttgart, Split, Krakow, and Florence. They have specific constraints on the number of days in each city and some events on certain days.\n\nFirst, let's list out the requirements:\n\n- Total days: 8\n- Prague: 4 days\n- Stuttgart: 2 days (with a wedding between day 2 and 3)\n- Split: 2 days (meet friends between day 3 and 4)\n- Krakow: 2 days\n- Florence: 2 days\n\nWait, adding up the days: 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12 days. But the total is supposed to be 8 days. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe overlapping days because flights count as being in both cities on the same day. So, for example, if you fly from A to B on day X, you spend day X in both cities. So the total days should sum to 8, but the individual cities' days can overlap on travel days.\n\nSo, let's re-express the days considering overlaps. The total days are 8, and each travel day counts as a day in both cities. So the sum of days in each city minus the number of travel days (since each travel day is counted twice) should equal 8.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to build the itinerary step by step, making sure that each city's required days are met and the events are on the correct days.\n\nFirst, the wedding in Stuttgart is between day 2 and 3. So Stuttgart must include day 2 and day 3. But the user needs to stay in Stuttgart for 2 days. So maybe days 2 and 3 in Stuttgart. But since the user is attending the wedding between day 2 and 3, perhaps the stay in Stuttgart is days 2 and 3. But depending on how the days are counted. Let's assume days are 1-based. So days 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThe wedding is between day 2 and day 3. So maybe days 2 and 3 in Stuttgart. That's two days. Then, Split needs to be visited for 2 days, meeting friends between day 3 and 4. Wait, but if day 3 is in Stuttgart, then Split would have to start on day 4. But the meeting is between day 3 and 4. Hmm, maybe the transition happens on day 3. So perhaps day 3 is split between Stuttgart and Split. So day 3 is counted as a day in both cities.\n\nBut the user wants to stay in Split for 2 days. Let's try to map this out.\n\nStarting with the wedding in Stuttgart on days 2-3. So Stuttgart must have days 2 and 3. But since the user needs to stay in Stuttgart for 2 days, that fits. Then, Split should have days where they meet friends between day 3 and 4. So perhaps day 3 is in Stuttgart, and day 4 is in Split. But how to get from Stuttgart to Split. According to the direct flights list, Stuttgart and Split have a direct flight. So possible.\n\nBut the user needs to be in Split for 2 days. So maybe days 3 and 4? Wait, but day 3 is also in Stuttgart. So day 3 is a travel day from Stuttgart to Split. Therefore, day 3 counts as a day in both cities. So Stuttgart would have days 2 and 3 (since departure is on day 3), and Split would have days 3 and 4. That meets the 2 days for Stuttgart and 2 days for Split. But Split needs 2 days, so days 3 and 4 would be okay.\n\nBut the user wants to meet friends in Split between day 3 and 4. So maybe arriving on day 3 evening, but the day is counted as Split. Hmm, maybe that works.\n\nNow, Prague needs 4 days. Let's see. The direct flights from Split include Split and Prague, Split and Krakow, Split and Stuttgart. So perhaps after Split, go to Prague. But Prague also connects to Florence. The user needs to visit Florence for 2 days. And Krakow for 2 days.\n\nSo possible itinerary:\n\nStart in Prague. But wait, the user needs to be in Stuttgart on days 2-3. So if starting in Prague, they need to fly to Stuttgart by day 2. Let's see:\n\nDay 1: Prague (1 day)\nDay 2: Fly to Stuttgart (counts as day 2 in both Prague and Stuttgart). But Prague needs 4 days. If day 1 is Prague, day 2 is Prague and Stuttgart. Then days 1,2,3,4 in Prague? Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the user must stay in Prague for 4 days. So total days in Prague must be 4. Let's see how to fit that.\n\nPossible sequence:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Days 1-4: Prague (4 days)\nBut then need to get to Stuttgart by day 2 for the wedding. That's impossible because days 1-4 would be Prague, but the wedding is on day 2-3. So this doesn't work.\n\nOption 2:\n\nStart in another city, maybe Krakow. Let's see.\n\nBut the user has to visit all 5 cities. Let's try to find a path that connects all cities with direct flights.\n\nThe direct flights are:\n\n- Stuttgart and Split\n\n- Prague and Florence\n\n- Krakow and Stuttgart\n\n- Krakow and Split\n\n- Split and Prague\n\n- Krakow and Prague\n\nSo possible routes:\n\nFrom Krakow, can go to Stuttgart, Split, or Prague.\n\nFrom Split, can go to Stuttgart, Krakow, Prague.\n\nFrom Prague, can go to Split, Florence.\n\nFrom Florence, only to Prague.\n\nFrom Stuttgart, can go to Split, Krakow.\n\nSo let's think about the required days and events.\n\nWedding in Stuttgart between day 2 and 3. So days 2 and 3 in Stuttgart.\n\nSplit needs 2 days with friends between day 3 and 4. So days 3 and 4 in Split? But day 3 is already in Stuttgart. Wait, perhaps day 3 is a travel day from Stuttgart to Split. So day 3 counts as both Stuttgart and Split. So Stuttgart has days 2 and 3 (2 days), Split has days 3 and 4 (2 days). That works.\n\nNow, the user needs to be in Split for 2 days (days 3 and 4), then where next? From Split, they can go to Prague, Krakow, or Stuttgart. But they need to visit Krakow (2 days) and Florence (2 days).\n\nFlorence is only connected to Prague. So the user must go to Prague to reach Florence.\n\nSo after Split, perhaps go to Prague. Split to Prague is a direct flight. So day 4: Split, day 5: travel to Prague (day 5 counts as Split and Prague?), but Split needs 2 days. Wait, Split is days 3 and 4. So day 4 is Split, then day 5 fly to Prague. So day 5 counts as Split and Prague? No, if you fly on day 5 from Split to Prague, then day 5 is counted as Split and Prague. But Split's 2 days are already days 3 and 4. So day 5 would be Prague's first day. Wait, but Prague needs 4 days. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, after Split (days 3 and 4), on day 5 fly to Prague, which would count day 5 as Split and Prague. But Split's days are already covered. So Prague would start on day 5. Then Prague needs 4 days. So days 5,6,7,8. But then days 5-8 in Prague (4 days). But then there's no time for Krakow and Florence. Because the user also needs to visit Krakow (2 days) and Florence (2 days).\n\nThis suggests that the itinerary is getting too long. Let's map out the days step by step.\n\nLet's start with the wedding in Stuttgart on days 2-3. So days 2 and 3 in Stuttgart.\n\nThen Split on days 3 and 4 (with day 3 being a travel day from Stuttgart to Split). So Split days 3 and 4.\n\nThen, from Split, fly to Krakow (direct flight exists). So day 4 is Split, day 5 fly to Krakow. So day 5 counts as Split and Krakow. But Split's days are already 3 and 4. So Krakow would be days 5 and 6 (since Krakow needs 2 days). So days 5 and 6 in Krakow.\n\nThen from Krakow, fly to Prague (direct flight). Day 6 is Krakow and Prague. So Prague days 6,7,8. But Prague needs 4 days. That's only 3 days (days 6,7,8). Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after Krakow, fly to Prague on day 7. Then Prague days 7 and 8. Still only 2 days. Not enough.\n\nHmm, maybe this path isn't working. Let's try another approach.\n\nThe user must end up in Florence, which connects only to Prague. So the last part must be Prague -> Florence. But Florence needs 2 days. So after Prague, fly to Florence for 2 days. But Prague needs 4 days, so if we have days in Prague, then Florence would need days after that.\n\nWait, total days are 8. Let's try to outline:\n\nDay 1: ?\n\nDay 2-3: Stuttgart (wedding)\n\nDay 3-4: Split (meet friends)\n\nThen need to fit in Krakow (2 days), Prague (4 days), Florence (2 days). But total days would be 8.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nDay 1: Start in Krakow. Fly to Stuttgart on day 2 (since Krakow and Stuttgart have a direct flight). But day 1 is Krakow (1 day), day 2: Krakow and Stuttgart. But Krakow needs 2 days. So days 1 and 2 in Krakow. Then day 2 fly to Stuttgart. So days 2 and 3 in Stuttgart. That gives Krakow 2 days (days 1 and 2), Stuttgart 2 days (days 2 and 3). Then day 3 fly to Split. Split days 3 and 4. Then from Split, fly to Prague on day 4. Prague days 4,5,6,7. Then fly to Florence on day 7. Florence days 7 and 8. Let's check:\n\nKrakow: days 1 and 2 (2 days)\n\nStuttgart: days 2 and 3 (2 days)\n\nSplit: days 3 and 4 (2 days)\n\nPrague: days 4,5,6,7 (4 days)\n\nFlorence: days 7 and 8 (2 days)\n\nTotal days: 8.\n\nYes, that adds up. Let's verify the direct flights:\n\n- Krakow to Stuttgart: yes (direct flight)\n\n- Stuttgart to Split: yes (direct flight)\n\n- Split to Prague: yes (direct flight)\n\n- Prague to Florence: yes (direct flight)\n\nThat works. Each flight is direct.\n\nNow, let's map the day ranges:\n\nDay 1: Krakow (Day 1-1)\n\nDay 2: Krakow (departure) and Stuttgart (arrival) \u2192 Day 2 is both cities. So Krakow is days 1-2, Stuttgart is days 2-3.\n\nDay 3: Stuttgart to Split \u2192 Day 3 is both. So Split starts on day 3. Split days 3-4.\n\nDay 4: Split to Prague \u2192 Day 4 is both. Prague starts day 4. Prague days 4-7 (since 4 days would be days 4,5,6,7). Then on day 7 fly to Florence. Florence days 7-8.\n\nSo the itinerary would be:\n\nDay 1-2: Krakow\n\nDay 2-3: Stuttgart\n\nDay 3-4: Split\n\nDay 4-7: Prague\n\nDay 7-8: Florence\n\nBut wait, Prague needs 4 days. Days 4-7 is 4 days (4,5,6,7). Correct.\n\nFlorence days 7-8: 2 days. Correct.\n\nKrakow days 1-2: 2 days.\n\nStuttgart days 2-3: 2 days.\n\nSplit days 3-4: 2 days.\n\nAll cities accounted for, and all flights are direct.\n\nThis seems to fit all the constraints. Let's check the events:\n\n- Wedding in Stuttgart between day 2 and 3: days 2-3 in Stuttgart. Correct.\n\n- Meet friends in Split between day 3 and 4: days 3-4 in Split. Correct.\n\nNow, let's format this into the JSON as specified.\n\nThe day ranges should be:\n\nKrakow: Day 1-2\n\nStuttgart: Day 2-3\n\nSplit: Day 3-4\n\nPrague: Day 4-7\n\nFlorence: Day 7-8\n\nBut the JSON array needs each entry as day ranges. However, the example in the problem shows entries like \"Day X-Y\" where each entry is a consecutive range. So the itinerary would be:\n\n[\n  {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n  {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-3\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"},\n  {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n  {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-7\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n  {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-8\", \"place\": \"Florence\"}\n]\n\nWait, but each entry is a consecutive range. However, the user's instruction says \"day ranges and places only\". So overlapping is allowed because the days when you travel count for both cities.\n\nBut in the JSON, each entry is a continuous range. So the above would be correct.",
