You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kimberly, Megan, Marie and Diana for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nMeganhas no meetings the whole day.\nMarie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nDiana is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nMegan would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 10:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT write any code or algorithms. Simply provide the answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}\n\nFor example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"

        "content": "The previous solution produced the following output:\n{\"time_range\": \"10:00:10:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\nThe following constraints were violated:\n\n- Time conflicts with existing schedule on Monday from 10 to 10.5\n\nPlease revise your plan to address these issues.\n\nPlease revise your solution to satisfy these constraints."
