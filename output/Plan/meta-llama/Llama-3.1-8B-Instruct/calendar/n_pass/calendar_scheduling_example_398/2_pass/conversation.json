You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Doris, Theresa, Christian, Terry, Carolyn and Kyle for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDoris has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nTheresa has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 12:00; \nChristianhas no meetings the whole day.\nTerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nCarolyn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; \nKyle has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT write any code or algorithms. Simply provide the answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}\n\nFor example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"
