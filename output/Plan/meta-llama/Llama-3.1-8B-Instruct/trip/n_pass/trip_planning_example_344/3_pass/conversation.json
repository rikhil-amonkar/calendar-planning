We can visit Naples from Day 1-6 and then visit Valencia from Day 7-12 and then visit Athens from Day 13-17 and then visit Zurich from Day 18-20.\n\nHowever, we can't visit Naples from Day 7-12 because we are in Naples from Day 7-12. We can visit Naples from Day 1-6 and then visit Zurich from Day 7-12 and then visit Naples from Day 13-17 and then visit Athens from Day 18-20 and then visit Valencia from Day 21-25.\n\nHowever, we only have 20 days in total. We can adjust the plan as follows:\n\n1. Valencia: Day 1-6 (6 days)\n2. Naples: Day 7-12 (6 days)\n3. Athens: Day 13-17 (5 days)\n   - Relatives visit: Day 1-6\n   - Wedding: Day 16-20\n4. Zurich: Day 18-20 (3 days)\n\nHowever, this plan still has a gap and overlap between Day 6 and Day 7. To address this, we can visit Athens from Day 7-12 and then visit Naples from Day 13-17 and then visit Zurich from Day 18-20 and then visit Valencia from Day 21-25.\n\nHowever, we only have 20 days in total.
