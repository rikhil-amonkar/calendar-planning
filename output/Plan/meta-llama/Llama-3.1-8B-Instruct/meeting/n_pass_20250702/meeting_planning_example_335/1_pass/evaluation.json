    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider various scenarios and choose the best one. \n\nFirst, we should try to meet Helen at North Beach, as she is available for a longer period. We can travel from Pacific Heights to North Beach in 9 minutes. Since Helen is available from 9:00AM to 5:00PM and we need to meet her for at least 15 minutes, we can meet her at 9:00AM.\n\nNext, we need to travel to the Mission District to meet Kevin, who is available from 10:45AM to 2:45PM. We can travel from North Beach to Mission District in 18 minutes. We can meet Kevin at 11:00AM.\n\nAfter meeting Kevin, we can travel back to Pacific Heights, but we don't have any other meetings scheduled for the day. So, we can head back to Pacific Heights.\n\nIn the evening, we have two more meetings scheduled. Betty will be at Financial District from 7:00PM to 9:45PM, and Amanda will be at Alamo Square from 7:45PM to 9:00PM. We need to meet Betty for at least 90 minutes and Amanda for at least 60 minutes.\n\nTo meet both Betty and Amanda, we can start by traveling from Pacific Heights to Financial District in 13 minutes. We can meet Betty at 7:00PM and stay with her until 8:30PM.\n\nAfter meeting Betty, we can travel from Financial District to Alamo Square in 17 minutes. We can meet Amanda at 8:30PM and stay with her until 9:00PM.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:33\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:02\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:17\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Amanda\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the above solution has a problem: there is no time to travel from Alamo Square back to Financial District in time to meet Betty. So, we need to adjust the schedule.\n\nWe can meet Kevin at 10:00AM instead of 11:00AM. After meeting Kevin, we can travel from Mission District to Financial District in 17 minutes. We can meet Betty at 11:00AM and stay with her until 8:30PM.\n\nWe can travel from Financial District to Alamo Square in 17 minutes. We can meet Amanda at 8:30PM and stay with her until 9:00PM.\n\nHere is the final meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:32\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:02\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Alamo Square\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:47\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Amanda\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
