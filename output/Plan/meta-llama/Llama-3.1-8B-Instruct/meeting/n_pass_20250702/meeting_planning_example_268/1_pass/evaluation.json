We want to meet Timothy for at least 105 minutes, Mark for at least 60 minutes, and Joseph for at least 60 minutes.\n\n1. Meet Timothy at Alamo Square: We can meet Timothy at Alamo Square from 12:00PM to 4:15PM. Since we need to meet him for at least 105 minutes, we can start the meeting at 12:00PM and end it at 2:45PM.\n2. Meet Mark at Presidio: We can meet Mark at Presidio from 6:45PM to 9:00PM. Since we need to meet him for at least 60 minutes, we can start the meeting at 6:45PM and end it at 7:45PM.\n3. Meet Joseph at Russian Hill: We can meet Joseph at Russian Hill from 4:45PM to 9:30PM. Since we need to meet him for at least 60 minutes, we can start the meeting at 4:45PM and end it at 5:45PM.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the travel times between locations. We can meet Timothy at Alamo Square, then travel to Presidio to meet Mark, and finally travel to Russian Hill to meet Joseph.\n\nHere is the optimized meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Timothy\", \"start_time\": \"12:00\", \"end_time\": \"14:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"travel\", \"person\": \"\", \"start_time\": \"14:45\", \"end_time\": \"15:00\", \"location\": \"Alamo Square\", \"destination\": \"Presidio\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mark\", \"start_time\": \"15:00\", \"end_time\": \"16:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"travel\", \"person\": \"\", \"start_time\": \"16:45\", \"end_time\": \"17:00\", \"location\": \"Presidio\", \"destination\": \"Russian Hill\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"17:00\", \"end_time\": \"18:00\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nNote: I added travel actions to the itinerary to represent the travel times between locations.",
