We meet Helen from 9:11 AM to 9:41 AM.\n\nNext, we travel from Mission District to Richmond District (20 minutes) and meet Mary from 9:51 AM to 11:06 AM.\n\nAfter meeting Mary, we travel from Richmond District to Haight-Ashbury (10 minutes) and wait for Sarah to arrive at Fisherman's Wharf. However, we can't meet Sarah yet because her schedule starts at 2:45 PM. We travel from Haight-Ashbury to Bayview (18 minutes) and meet Thomas from 10:09 AM to 1:09 PM.\n\nFinally, we travel from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf (25 minutes) and meet Sarah from 2:34 PM to 4:19 PM.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Helen\", \"start_time\": \"09:11\", \"end_time\": \"09:41\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"09:51\", \"end_time\": \"11:06\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Thomas\", \"start_time\": \"10:09\", \"end_time\": \"13:09\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sarah\", \"start_time\": \"14:34\", \"end_time\": \"16:19\"}]}",
