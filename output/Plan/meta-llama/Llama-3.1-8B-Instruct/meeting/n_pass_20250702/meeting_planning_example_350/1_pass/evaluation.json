    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo meet all friends while considering the given constraints and travel times, we need to find the optimal order of meetings. \n\nFirst, we'll meet Betty at Haight-Ashbury from 9:00AM to 10:30AM. This is because Betty's availability is the longest and we can meet her early in the day.\n\nNext, we'll head to Pacific Heights to meet Mary from 11:00AM to 12:30PM. This is because Mary's availability overlaps with Charles', and we can meet her before Charles.\n\nAfter meeting Mary, we'll head to the Financial District to meet Charles from 1:00PM to 3:00PM. This is because Charles' availability is the longest, and we can meet him after Mary.\n\nFinally, we'll head back to the Mission District to meet Lisa from 8:30PM to 10:00PM.\n\nHere's the JSON format of the meeting schedule:\n\n```\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Charles\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Lisa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule allows us to meet all friends while considering their availability and travel times.",
