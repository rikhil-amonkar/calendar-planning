This is because Betty's availability is the longest and we can meet her early in the day.\n\nNext, we'll head to Pacific Heights to meet Mary from 11:00AM to 12:30PM. This is because Mary's availability overlaps with Charles', and we can meet her before Charles.\n\nAfter meeting Mary, we'll head to the Financial District to meet Charles from 1:00PM to 3:00PM.
