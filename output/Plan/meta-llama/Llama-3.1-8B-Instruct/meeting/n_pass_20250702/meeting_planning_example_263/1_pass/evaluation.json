    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider the constraints and the available time for each person. Since Anthony has the longest required meeting time, we should prioritize meeting him first.\n\n1. Meet Anthony (9:15AM - 10:30AM)\nWe arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM and Anthony is available from 9:15AM. Since Anthony requires a 105-minute meeting, we will meet him from 9:15AM to 10:30AM.\n\n2. Meet Karen (10:30AM - 11:00AM)\nAfter meeting Anthony, we will head to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Karen. Since Karen is available from 8:45AM to 3:00PM and we want to meet her for at least 30 minutes, we will meet her from 10:30AM to 11:00AM.\n\n3. Head to Embarcadero (11:00AM - 11:04AM)\nWe will head to Embarcadero from Fisherman's Wharf.\n\n4. Free time (11:04AM - 7:45PM)\nWe will have free time until Betty is available at Embarcadero.\n\n5. Meet Betty (7:45PM - 8:00PM)\nWe will meet Betty from 7:45PM to 8:00PM, which is a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Anthony\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"head to\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:04\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
