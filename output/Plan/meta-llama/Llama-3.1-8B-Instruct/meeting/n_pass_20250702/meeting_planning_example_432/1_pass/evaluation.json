    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider the constraints and travel times. We can start by meeting David at Embarcadero from 8:15AM to 9:00AM, as it's the only time slot that works for David and it's close to our starting location at Golden Gate Park.\n\nNext, we can meet Barbara at Financial District from 10:30AM to 4:30PM. However, we can't meet Barbara immediately after meeting David, as we need to travel to Financial District, which takes 26 minutes. We can meet Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00AM to 5:30PM after meeting David, but we need to ensure that we meet Joseph for at least 90 minutes. Since we can't meet Joseph immediately after meeting David, we can meet Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:00AM to 10:30AM, but this will leave us with only 30 minutes to meet Joseph. To meet Joseph for at least 90 minutes, we can meet Joseph at Fisherman's Wharf from 10:30AM to 12:00PM.\n\nAfter meeting Joseph, we can meet Kevin at Mission District from 11:15AM to 3:15PM. We can meet Kevin at Mission District from 11:15AM to 11:45AM, as we need to meet Kevin for at least 30 minutes.\n\nFinally, we can meet Jeffrey at Bayview from 5:30PM to 9:30PM after meeting Kevin. However, we need to travel to Bayview, which takes 23 minutes. We can meet Jeffrey at Bayview from 3:15PM to 4:15PM, as we need to meet Jeffrey for at least 60 minutes.\n\nHere is the optimized meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"David\", \"start_time\": \"08:15\", \"end_time\": \"09:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"travel\", \"destination\": \"Financial District\", \"start_time\": \"09:00\", \"end_time\": \"09:26\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"10:30\", \"end_time\": \"04:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"travel\", \"destination\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\", \"start_time\": \"09:26\", \"end_time\": \"09:32\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Joseph\", \"start_time\": \"10:30\", \"end_time\": \"12:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"travel\", \"destination\": \"Mission District\", \"start_time\": \"09:32\", \"end_time\": \"09:49\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kevin\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"travel\", \"destination\": \"Bayview\", \"start_time\": \"11:45\", \"end_time\": \"12:08\"},\n    {\"action\": \"wait\", \"start_time\": \"12:08\", \"end_time\": \"15:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"travel\", \"destination\": \"Bayview\", \"start_time\": \"15:15\", \"end_time\": \"15:38\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:30\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: I've added \"travel\" and \"wait\" actions to the itinerary to make it more accurate.",
