    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider various scenarios. Since we want to meet both Karen and Mark, we'll prioritize their meetings. \n\nFirst, let's find the earliest time we can meet Mark, which is 1:00 PM. We can meet Mark at Embarcadero from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM (120 minutes). \n\nAfter meeting Mark, we'll head to North Beach to pick up any other activities we can do before Karen's meeting. \n\nNext, we'll travel to Pacific Heights to meet Karen. Since we want to meet Karen for at least 90 minutes, we'll meet her from 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM.\n\nHere's the optimized meeting schedule:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:06\" \n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"free time\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:06\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:53\" \n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: Since we have 3 hours of free time, we could potentially visit other friends or activities in the area. However, we've prioritized meeting Karen and Mark according to their availability and our constraints.",
