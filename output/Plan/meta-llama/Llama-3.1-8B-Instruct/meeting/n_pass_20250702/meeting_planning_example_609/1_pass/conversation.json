We'll start by meeting Carol, as her available time slot is the earliest.\n\n1. Meet Carol at Presidio from 8:15AM to 8:45AM.\n\nNext, we'll head to Deborah at Golden Gate Park. However, her available time slot is from 7:00AM to 6:15PM, but we need at least 90 minutes to meet her. We can meet her from 7:00AM to 8:30AM, but then we would have to leave early to meet Carol. Instead, we can meet Deborah from 8:30AM to 10:00AM after meeting Carol.\n\n2. Meet Deborah at Golden Gate Park from 8:30AM to 10:00AM.\n\nNow, we need to meet David at Mission District.
