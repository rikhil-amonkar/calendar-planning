Rebecca (13:15-16:30)\n3. Kimberly (13:15-13:30)\n4. Robert (14:01-14:16)\n5. Kenneth (19:15-21:15)\n\nWe will use a greedy algorithm to schedule the meetings. The algorithm starts with the first meeting and then adds the next meeting that does not conflict with the previous one.\n\nHere is the revised plan:\n\n1. Margaret (9:30-10:00)\n2. Rebecca (13:15-16:30)\n3. Kimberly (13:15-13:30)\n4. Robert (14:01-14:16)\n5. Kenneth (19:15-21:15)\n\nThe plan starts with Margaret's meeting from 9:30 to 10:00. The next meeting is Rebecca's meeting from 13:15 to 16:30. However, Kimberly's meeting from 13:15 to 13:30 conflicts with Rebecca's meeting. Therefore, we will schedule Kimberly's meeting from 13:15 to 13:30 and then Rebecca's meeting from 13:30 to 16:30.\n\nThe next meeting is Robert's meeting from 14:01 to 14:16. This meeting does not conflict with the previous one, so we will add it to the plan.\n\nThe next meeting is Kenneth's meeting from 19:15 to 21:15. This meeting does not conflict with the previous one, so we will add it to the plan.\n\nThe final plan is:\n\n1. Margaret (9:30-10:00)\n2. Kimberly (13:15-13:30)\n3. Rebecca (13:30-16:30)\n4. Robert (14:01-14:16)\n5. Kenneth (19:15-21:15)\n\nThis plan satisfies all the constraints.",
