We need to meet for at least 90 minutes, so we can start our meeting at 7:15AM and end at 9:45AM.\n\nNext, let's meet Daniel at Mission District from 7:00AM to 11:15AM. We need to meet for at least 105 minutes, so we can start our meeting at 7:00AM and end at 12:45PM.\n\nSince we can't meet Jessica until 1:45PM, let's meet William at North Beach from 1:15PM to 8:15PM. We need to meet for at least 15 minutes, so we can start our meeting at 1:15PM and end at 1:30PM.\n\nNow, let's meet Jessica at Golden Gate Park from 1:45PM to 3:00PM. We need to meet for at least 30 minutes, so we can start our meeting at 1:45PM and end at 2:15PM.\n\nFinally, let's meet Ashley at Bayview from 5:15PM to 8:00PM. We need to meet for at least 105 minutes, so we can start our meeting at 5:15PM and end at 7:00PM.\n\nHere's the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Ronald\",\n      \"start_time\": \"07:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Daniel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"07:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"William\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Ashley\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: I've assumed that we can't meet multiple people at the same time. If we can, we might be able to optimize the schedule further."
