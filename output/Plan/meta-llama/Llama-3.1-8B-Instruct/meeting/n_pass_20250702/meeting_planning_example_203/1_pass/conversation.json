Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.\n\nTravel distances (in minutes):\nFinancial District to Fisherman's Wharf: 10.\nFinancial District to Pacific Heights: 13.\nFinancial District to Mission District: 17.\nFisherman's Wharf to Financial District: 11.\nFisherman's Wharf to Pacific Heights: 12.\nFisherman's Wharf to Mission District: 22.\nPacific Heights to Financial District: 13.\nPacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf: 13.\nPacific Heights to Mission District: 15.\nMission District to Financial District: 17.\nMission District to Fisherman's Wharf: 22.\nMission District to Pacific Heights: 16.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Financial District at 9:00AM. David will be at Fisherman's Wharf from 10:45AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet David for a minimum of 15 minutes. Timothy will be at Pacific Heights from 9:00AM to 3:30PM. You'd like to meet Timothy for a minimum of 75 minutes. Robert will be at Mission District from 12:15PM to 7:45PM.

        "content": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider the constraints and available times for each friend. We'll start by meeting Timothy at Pacific Heights from 9:00AM to 3:30PM, as this is the only time slot where we can meet him for at least 75 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to meet David at Fisherman's Wharf from 10:45AM to 3:30PM. We can meet him for at least 15 minutes during this time slot. However, we need to consider the travel time from Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf, which is 12 minutes. \n\nSince we can't travel during the meeting, we'll need to arrive at Fisherman's Wharf by 10:33AM to meet David for 15 minutes. However, we can't meet David at 10:33AM because David will not be at Fisherman's Wharf until 10:45AM. \n\nTherefore, we will meet David at 10:45AM and leave by 11:00AM to meet Robert at Mission District from 12:15PM to 7:45PM. We can meet Robert for at least 90 minutes during this time slot. \n\nHere is the optimized meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Timothy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:27\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:17\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this schedule is not optimal as we are traveling to Fisherman's Wharf to meet David and then to Mission District to meet Robert. We should meet Robert first and then travel to Fisherman's Wharf to meet David. \n\nHere is the optimized meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Timothy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:32\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
