Meet Nancy at Presidio from 11:45AM to 12:15PM.\n2. Travel to Bayview (31 minutes) and then to Pacific Heights (23 minutes) to meet Matthew from 3:45PM to 5:10PM.\n3. Travel to Russian Hill (7 minutes) to meet Matthew from 5:10PM to 6:35PM.\n4. Travel to Union Square (13 minutes) to meet Carol from 6:00PM to 8:15PM.\n5. Travel to Nob Hill (9 minutes) to meet Paul from 4:15PM to 9:15PM, but we can't meet Paul for 60 minutes as we have to meet Carol. So we will meet Paul for 60 minutes from 4:15PM to 5:15PM.\n6.
