After meeting Carol, we can head to Mission District to meet Rebecca. \n\nThe travel time from Union Square to Sunset District is 26 minutes, and the travel time from Sunset District to Mission District is 24 minutes. So, the total travel time is 50 minutes. Since Rebecca will be available from 11:30AM, we can meet her from 12:20PM.\n\nWe can visit Karen after meeting Rebecca. The travel time from Mission District to Bayview is 15 minutes. Since Karen will be available from 12:45PM, we can meet her from 1:00PM.\n\nHere's the optimized meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Carol\", \"start_time\": \"10:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Rebecca\", \"start_time\": \"12:20\", \"end_time\": \"2:40\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Karen\", \"start_time\": \"13:00\", \"end_time\": \"15:00\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule allows us to meet Carol for 1 hour and 30 minutes, Rebecca for 2 hours and 20 minutes, and Karen for 2 hours.",
