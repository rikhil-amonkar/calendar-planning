    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To meet Helen, Kimberly, and Patricia for the minimum required time, we need to optimize the schedule considering the given constraints.\n\nFirst, we'll meet Helen at North Beach. Since Helen is available from 7:00AM to 4:45PM, and we need to meet her for at least 120 minutes, we should meet her as early as possible.\n\nWe arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00AM and travel to North Beach, which takes 8 minutes. We can meet Helen from 9:08AM to 11:28AM (2 hours and 20 minutes). This exceeds the required 120 minutes, so we'll meet Helen from 9:08AM to 11:28AM.\n\nAfter meeting Helen, we travel back to Nob Hill (7 minutes) and then to Fisherman's Wharf (11 minutes), which takes a total of 18 minutes. We arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 11:46AM. However, Kimberly won't be available until 4:30PM.\n\nWe can now visit Bayview, but it's too far from Fisherman's Wharf, and we won't be able to visit Patricia. We'll visit Bayview after meeting Kimberly.\n\nWe travel back to Nob Hill (11 minutes) and then to Bayview (20 minutes), which takes a total of 31 minutes. We arrive at Bayview at 12:17PM. However, Patricia won't be available until 6:00PM.\n\nWe travel back to Nob Hill (20 minutes) and then to Fisherman's Wharf (11 minutes), which takes a total of 31 minutes. We arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 12:48PM. However, we can't visit anyone until 4:30PM.\n\nWe travel back to Nob Hill (11 minutes) and then to Fisherman's Wharf (11 minutes), which takes a total of 22 minutes. We arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 4:10PM. We can meet Kimberly from 4:10PM to 4:55PM (45 minutes).\n\nAfter meeting Kimberly, we travel to Bayview (26 minutes), which takes 26 minutes. We arrive at Bayview at 4:36PM. We can meet Patricia from 4:36PM to 9:15PM (4 hours and 39 minutes). This exceeds the required 120 minutes, so we'll meet Patricia from 4:36PM to 9:15PM.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in the JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:08\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:28\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:28\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:46\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:46\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:17\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:17\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:48\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:48\",\n      \"end_time\": \"04:10\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"04:10\",\n      \"end_time\": \"04:36\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"04:10\",\n      \"end_time\": \"04:55\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Patricia\",\n      \"start_time\": \"04:36\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
