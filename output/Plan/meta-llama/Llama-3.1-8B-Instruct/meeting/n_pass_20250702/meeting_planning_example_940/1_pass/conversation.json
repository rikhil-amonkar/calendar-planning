Then, we'll head to North Beach to meet John from 11:00AM to 11:15AM. Next, we'll head to Union Square to meet Nancy from 11:15AM to 12:00PM. After that, we'll head to Mission District to meet Kevin from 12:00PM to 1:45PM. \n\nHowever, we cannot meet Mark at Fisherman's Wharf from 5:15PM to 8:00PM as it conflicts with our meeting with Jason at Marina District from 3:15PM to 9:45PM.
