    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the schedule, we need to consider the time constraints and distances between locations. We'll start by meeting Sandra at Nob Hill, as she's available for the longest duration and is closest to North Beach.\n\n1. Meet Sandra at Nob Hill (8:00 AM - 3:30 PM)\n   - Distance from North Beach: 7 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 15 minutes (minimum)\n\nNext, we'll head to Union Square to meet Jeffrey, as he's available for a significant duration and is relatively close to Nob Hill.\n\n2. Meet Jeffrey at Union Square (9:30 AM - 3:30 PM)\n   - Distance from Nob Hill: 9 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 120 minutes (minimum)\n\nAfter meeting Jeffrey, we'll head to Chinatown to meet Robert. Robert is available for a few hours, and Chinatown is relatively close to Union Square.\n\n3. Meet Robert at Chinatown (12:15 PM - 4:45 PM)\n   - Distance from Union Square: 7 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 90 minutes (minimum)\n\nNext, we'll head to Pacific Heights to meet James. James is available in the evening, and Pacific Heights is relatively close to Chinatown.\n\n4. Meet James at Pacific Heights (8:00 PM - 10:00 PM)\n   - Distance from Chinatown: 11 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 120 minutes (minimum)\n\nWe still need to meet Carol and Mark, but their availability is in the evening. We can head to the Mission District to meet Carol, as she's available for a few hours and is relatively close to Pacific Heights.\n\n5. Meet Carol at Mission District (6:15 PM - 9:15 PM)\n   - Distance from Pacific Heights: 15 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 15 minutes (minimum)\n\nFinally, we'll head to Golden Gate Park to meet Mark. Mark is available for a few hours, and Golden Gate Park is relatively close to the Mission District.\n\n6. Meet Mark at Golden Gate Park (11:30 AM - 5:45 PM)\n   - Distance from Mission District: 17 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 15 minutes (minimum)\n\nHowever, Mark is available from 11:30 AM to 5:45 PM, but we met Jeffrey at 9:30 AM. We can meet Mark before meeting Jeffrey, but we would have to go from North Beach to Golden Gate Park, which takes 22 minutes. Since we already met Sandra, it would be more efficient to meet Mark after meeting Jeffrey.\n\nHere is the corrected meeting schedule:\n\n1. Meet Sandra at Nob Hill (8:00 AM - 3:30 PM)\n   - Distance from North Beach: 7 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 15 minutes (minimum)\n\n2. Meet Jeffrey at Union Square (9:30 AM - 3:30 PM)\n   - Distance from Nob Hill: 9 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 120 minutes (minimum)\n\n3. Meet Mark at Golden Gate Park (11:30 AM - 5:45 PM)\n   - Distance from Union Square: 22 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 15 minutes (minimum)\n\n4. Meet Robert at Chinatown (12:15 PM - 4:45 PM)\n   - Distance from Union Square: 7 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 90 minutes (minimum)\n\n5. Meet James at Pacific Heights (8:00 PM - 10:00 PM)\n   - Distance from Chinatown: 11 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 120 minutes (minimum)\n\n6. Meet Carol at Mission District (6:15 PM - 9:15 PM)\n   - Distance from Pacific Heights: 15 minutes\n   - Meeting duration: 15 minutes (minimum)\n\nHere is the final meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sandra\", \"start_time\": \"08:00\", \"end_time\": \"08:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jeffrey\", \"start_time\": \"09:30\", \"end_time\": \"12:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mark\", \"start_time\": \"11:30\", \"end_time\": \"11:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Robert\", \"start_time\": \"12:15\", \"end_time\": \"16:45\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"James\", \"start_time\": \"20:00\", \"end_time\": \"22:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Carol\", \"start_time\": \"18:15\", \"end_time\": \"18:30\"}\n  ]\n}",
