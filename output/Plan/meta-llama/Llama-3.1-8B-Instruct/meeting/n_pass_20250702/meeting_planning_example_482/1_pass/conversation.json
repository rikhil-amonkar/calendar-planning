        "content": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible, we'll consider the given constraints and travel times. \n\nFirst, we should meet Richard at Pacific Heights from 7:15AM to 10:15AM. This is because Richard is available for the longest period of time and we need to meet him for at least 75 minutes.\n\nNext, we should head to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Jason from 8:30AM to 5:45PM. We need to meet Jason for at least 60 minutes, and he is available for a long period of time.\n\nAfter meeting Jason, we should head to Mission District to meet Stephanie from 8:15AM to 1:45PM. We need to meet Stephanie for at least 90 minutes, and she is available from 8:15AM to 1:45PM.\n\nHere's the meeting schedule:\n\n```\n{\"itinerary\": [\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Richard\", \"start_time\": \"09:00\", \"end_time\": \"10:15\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jason\", \"start_time\": \"10:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:15\"},\n  {\"action\": \"travel\", \"person\": \"\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:26\", \"destination\": \"Mission District\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Stephanie\", \"start_time\": \"11:26\", \"end_time\": \"13:26\"},\n  {\"action\": \"travel\", \"person\": \"\", \"start_time\": \"13:26\", \"end_time\": \"13:39\", \"destination\": \"Bayview\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sandra\", \"start_time\": \"13:39\", \"end_time\": \"13:54\"},\n  {\"action\": \"travel\", \"person\": \"\", \"start_time\": \"13:54\", \"end_time\": \"14:07\", \"destination\": \"Russian Hill\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"14:07\", \"end_time\": \"16:07\"}\n]}\n```\n\nHowever, this schedule does not meet the 15-minute requirement for Sandra. We can adjust the schedule to meet Sandra for at least 15 minutes.\n\nHere's the updated schedule:\n\n```\n{\"itinerary\": [\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Richard\", \"start_time\": \"09:00\", \"end_time\": \"10:15\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jason\", \"start_time\": \"10:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:15\"},\n  {\"action\": \"travel\", \"person\": \"\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"11:26\", \"destination\": \"Mission District\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Stephanie\", \"start_time\": \"11:26\", \"end_time\": \"13:26\"},\n  {\"action\": \"travel\", \"person\": \"\", \"start_time\": \"13:26\", \"end_time\": \"13:39\", \"destination\": \"Bayview\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sandra\", \"start_time\": \"13:39\", \"end_time\": \"13:54\"},\n  {\"action\": \"travel\", \"person\": \"\", \"start_time\": \"13:54\", \"end_time\": \"14:07\", \"destination\": \"Russian Hill\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Brian\", \"start_time\": \"14:07\", \"end_time\": \"16:07\"},\n  {\"action\": \"travel\", \"person\": \"\", \"start_time\": \"16:07\", \"end_time\": \"16:20\", \"destination\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\"},\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jason\", \"start_time\": \"16:20\", \"end_time\": \"17:20\"}\n]}\n```\n\nThis schedule meets all the requirements."
