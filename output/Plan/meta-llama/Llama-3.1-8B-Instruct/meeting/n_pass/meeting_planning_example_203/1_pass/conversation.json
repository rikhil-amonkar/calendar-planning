        "content": "SOLUTION:\nTo optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider the constraints and the travel distances. We want to meet David for at least 15 minutes, Timothy for at least 75 minutes, and Robert for at least 90 minutes.\n\nFirst, we'll meet Timothy at Pacific Heights from 9:00AM to 11:45AM. Then, we'll travel to Fisherman's Wharf to meet David from 12:00PM to 2:45PM. Finally, we'll travel to Mission District to meet Robert from 4:00PM to 6:30PM.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Timothy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:55\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, we can optimize the meeting with Robert further. Since we have to travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Mission District, which takes 22 minutes, and we have to meet Robert for at least 90 minutes, it would be better to meet Robert from 2:00PM to 5:30PM.\n\nHere's the updated JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Timothy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:55\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"location\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:02\",\n      \"location\": \"Mission District\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:02\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:32\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
