We'll start by meeting Barbara at Golden Gate Park since she's available for the longest duration.\n\nWe arrive at Financial District at 9:00AM. We can head to Golden Gate Park immediately, which takes 23 minutes. We'll meet Barbara at Golden Gate Park from 9:23AM to 7:00PM.\n\nAfter meeting Barbara, we can head to Chinatown to meet Kenneth. Since Kenneth will be available from 12:00PM to 3:00PM, we'll meet him at Chinatown from 12:00PM to 1:30PM. This ensures that we meet Kenneth for a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nHere's the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:23\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
