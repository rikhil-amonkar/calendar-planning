    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider the constraints and travel times. \n\nFirst, we should meet Elizabeth at Golden Gate Park, as her availability is the longest and we want to meet her for the minimum of 105 minutes. We can start this meeting at 9:00AM and end at 2:15PM.\n\nNext, we should meet Brian at Financial District. Since Brian is available from 9:45AM, we can meet him for the minimum of 15 minutes during Elizabeth's meeting, from 10:00AM to 10:15AM.\n\nAfter meeting Brian, we can travel to Richmond District to meet Jason. However, Jason is not available until 1:00PM, so we should travel to Union Square to meet Laura instead. We can meet Laura for the minimum of 75 minutes from 1:00PM to 3:15PM.\n\nAfter meeting Laura, we can travel to Richmond District to meet Jason from 3:15PM to 8:45PM, but we can't meet him for the minimum of 90 minutes because his availability ends at 8:45PM. We can meet him from 3:15PM to 6:15PM, which is 3 hours. \n\nFinally, we should travel to North Beach to meet Melissa from 6:45PM to 8:15PM, which is the minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule allows us to meet all our friends for the minimum required time, while also considering the travel times between locations.",
