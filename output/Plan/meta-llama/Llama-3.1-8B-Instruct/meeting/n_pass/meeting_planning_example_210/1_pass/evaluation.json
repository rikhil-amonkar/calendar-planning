    "execution_output": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and the travel times. Since we want to meet Emily for a minimum of 105 minutes, Joseph for a minimum of 120 minutes, and Melissa for a minimum of 75 minutes, we should prioritize their meetings.\n\nLet's analyze the possible meeting schedules:\n\n1. Meet Melissa first (Financial District): We can meet Melissa from 3:45PM to 5:00PM (1h 15m) at the Financial District. After meeting Melissa, we can head to the Presidio to meet Emily from 4:15PM to 7:15PM (3h), which exceeds the required 105 minutes.\n\nItinerary: \n- 3:45PM - 5:00PM: meet Melissa at Financial District\n- 5:00PM - 7:15PM: meet Emily at Presidio\n\n2. Meet Joseph first (Richmond District): We can meet Joseph from 5:15PM to 7:35PM (2h 20m) at the Richmond District. After meeting Joseph, we can head to the Presidio to meet Emily from 7:35PM to 10:35PM (3h), which exceeds the required 105 minutes.\n\nItinerary: \n- 5:15PM - 7:35PM: meet Joseph at Richmond District\n- 7:35PM - 10:35PM: meet Emily at Presidio\n\nHowever, meeting both Joseph and Emily in the evening is not ideal because we have to travel from the Richmond District to the Presidio, which takes 7 minutes. It would be more efficient to meet Emily first and then Joseph.\n\nLet's analyze the possible meeting schedules:\n\n1. Meet Emily first (Presidio): We can meet Emily from 4:15PM to 7:15PM (3h) at the Presidio. After meeting Emily, we can head to the Richmond District to meet Joseph from 7:15PM to 10:00PM (2h 45m), which exceeds the required 120 minutes.\n\nItinerary: \n- 4:15PM - 7:15PM: meet Emily at Presidio\n- 7:15PM - 10:00PM: meet Joseph at Richmond District\n\n2. Meet Emily first (Presidio) and then Melissa (Financial District): We can meet Emily from 4:15PM to 7:15PM (3h) at the Presidio. After meeting Emily, we can head to the Financial District to meet Melissa from 7:15PM to 9:00PM (1h 45m), which exceeds the required 75 minutes.\n\nItinerary: \n- 4:15PM - 7:15PM: meet Emily at Presidio\n- 7:15PM - 9:00PM: meet Melissa at Financial District\n\nHowever, this schedule does not allow us to meet Joseph. We can meet Joseph from 5:15PM to 10:00PM (4h 45m) at the Richmond District, but we cannot meet Melissa in the evening.\n\nThe optimal schedule is to meet Emily first (Presidio) and then Joseph (Richmond District).\n\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Emily\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:22\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:22\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nNote: Since we have to travel from the Presidio to the Richmond District, we added a travel action between the two meetings.",
