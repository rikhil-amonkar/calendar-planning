We start at Richmond District at 9:00 AM.\n2.  Since Margaret will be at Bayview from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM and we want to meet her for at least 30 minutes, we should head to Bayview.\n3.  We arrive at Bayview at 9:30 AM and meet Margaret from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM.\n4.  After meeting Margaret, we head back to Richmond District to avoid unnecessary travel.\n5.  We arrive back at Richmond District at 10:00 AM.\n6.  Since Rebecca will be at Financial District from 1:15 PM to 4:45 PM and we want to meet her for at least 75 minutes, we should head to Financial District.\n7.  However, we need to meet Kimberly from 1:15 PM to 4:45 PM as well. We can't meet Rebecca and Kimberly at the same time, so we'll meet Kimberly first.\n8.  We head to Marina District at 12:00 PM to meet Kimberly from 1:15 PM to 1:30 PM.\n9.  We then head to Financial District at 1:30 PM to meet Rebecca from 1:30 PM to 4:45 PM.\n10. Since Robert will be at Chinatown from 12:15 PM to 8:15 PM and we want to meet him for at least 15 minutes, we should head to Chinatown.\n11.  We head to Chinatown at 4:45 PM to meet Robert from 4:45 PM to 5:00 PM.\n12.  Finally, we head to Union Square at 7:30 PM to meet Kenneth from 7:30 PM to 9:15 PM.\n\nHere's the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Margaret\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that the \"travel\" actions are included to show the transitions between meetings, but they don't contribute to the overall meeting time.",
