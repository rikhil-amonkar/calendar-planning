        "content": "SOLUTION: To optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider the travel times and the constraints given. \n\nWe will first meet Richard at Haight-Ashbury, as it is the earliest time we can meet him and it takes the least amount of time to get there from the Richmond District. \n\nAfter meeting Richard, we will head to the Mission District to meet Elizabeth. This is because Elizabeth is available for the longest period of time, and we need to meet her for at least 120 minutes.\n\nAfter meeting Elizabeth, we will head to the Sunset District to meet Sarah. This is because Sarah is available for a significant period of time, and we need to meet her for at least 30 minutes.\n\nFinally, we will head to Golden Gate Park to meet Michelle. This is the last meeting, and we need to meet her for at least 90 minutes.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:15PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:15PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:25PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:25PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"4:25PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"4:25PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"4:35PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"4:35PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"5:05PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"5:05PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"5:15PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Michelle\",\n      \"start_time\": \"5:15PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"7:15PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the above schedule does not meet the requirements for the minimum meeting duration for Elizabeth and Michelle. \n\nTo meet the requirements, we need to adjust the schedule. We will first meet Elizabeth at the Mission District, then head to the Sunset District to meet Sarah, and finally head to Golden Gate Park to meet Michelle.\n\nHere is the updated schedule:\n\n```\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45AM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:15PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:15PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"1:25PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"1:25PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"4:05PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"4:05PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"4:15PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"4:15PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"4:45PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"4:45PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"4:55PM\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Michelle\",\n      \"start_time\": \"4:55PM\",\n      \"end_time\": \"7:55PM\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this schedule still does not meet the requirements. \n\nTo meet the requirements, we need to adjust the schedule again.
