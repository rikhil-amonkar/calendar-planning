    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider the constraints and the travel times between locations. \n\n1. Meet Richard at Haight-Ashbury: Since Richard is available from 11:45AM to 3:45PM, and we need to meet him for at least 90 minutes, we should aim to meet him as early as possible to maximize the time spent with the other friends. \n\n2. Meet Elizabeth at Mission District: Elizabeth is available from 11:00AM to 5:15PM, and we need to meet her for at least 120 minutes. To meet both Richard and Elizabeth, we should meet Elizabeth first and then head to Haight-Ashbury to meet Richard. \n\n3. Meet Sarah at Sunset District: Since Sarah is available from 10:45AM to 7:00PM, and we need to meet her for at least 30 minutes, we should meet her after meeting Elizabeth and Richard.\n\nConsidering the travel times, here is the optimal schedule:\n\n- 9:00AM: Arrive at Richmond District\n- 9:10AM: Travel to Mission District (20 minutes)\n- 9:30AM: Meet Elizabeth at Mission District\n- 11:00AM: Elizabeth's availability ends, so we need to meet her for 120 minutes. We've already met her for 30 minutes, so we have 90 minutes left.\n- 11:30AM: Travel to Haight-Ashbury (10 minutes)\n- 11:40AM: Meet Richard at Haight-Ashbury\n- 2:10PM: Richard's availability ends, so we need to meet him for 90 minutes. We've already met him for 90 minutes, so we're done.\n- 2:10PM: Travel to Sunset District (12 minutes)\n- 2:22PM: Meet Sarah at Sunset District\n- 7:00PM: Sarah's availability ends, so we need to meet her for 30 minutes. We've already met her for 30 minutes, so we're done.\n- 7:00PM: Travel to Golden Gate Park (10 minutes)\n- 7:10PM: Meet Michelle at Golden Gate Park\n- 8:45PM: Michelle's availability ends, so we need to meet her for 90 minutes. We've already met her for 75 minutes, so we're done.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Elizabeth\", \"start_time\": \"09:30\", \"end_time\": \"11:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Richard\", \"start_time\": \"11:40\", \"end_time\": \"14:10\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sarah\", \"start_time\": \"14:22\", \"end_time\": \"16:22\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Michelle\", \"start_time\": \"19:10\", \"end_time\": \"20:45\"}\n  ]\n}",
