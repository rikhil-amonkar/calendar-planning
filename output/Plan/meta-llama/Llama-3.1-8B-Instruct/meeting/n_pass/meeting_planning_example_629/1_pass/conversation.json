Meet Matthew at Presidio from 11:00AM to 9:00PM. Since we want to meet Matthew for a minimum of 90 minutes, we should arrive at Presidio before 11:00AM. However, since we arrive at Russian Hill at 9:00AM, we can't make it to Presidio in time. Therefore, we should consider meeting Matthew after 11:00AM.\n\n2.
