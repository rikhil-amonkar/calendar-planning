    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider the constraints and travel times. We'll prioritize the friends with the longest required meeting times.\n\n1. Thomas at Bayview from 3:15PM to 6:45PM (120 minutes) - This is the longest required meeting time, so we'll start with Thomas.\n\n2. Sarah at Fisherman's Wharf from 2:45PM to 5:30PM (105 minutes) - We can meet Sarah after meeting Thomas, as the travel time from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes.\n\n3. Mary at Richmond District from 1:00PM to 7:15PM (75 minutes) - We can meet Mary before meeting Sarah, as the travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Richmond District is 10 minutes.\n\nHere's the optimal schedule:\n\n- 9:00AM: Arrive at Haight-Ashbury\n- 9:00AM: Meet Mary at Richmond District (10 minutes from Haight-Ashbury)\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"09:00\", \"end_time\": \"09:35\"}\n- 9:35AM: Travel back to Haight-Ashbury (10 minutes)\n- 9:45AM: Travel to Bayview (18 minutes)\n- 10:03AM: Meet Thomas at Bayview\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Thomas\", \"start_time\": \"10:03\", \"end_time\": \"13:03\"}\n- 3:15PM: Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (25 minutes)\n- 3:40PM: Meet Sarah at Fisherman's Wharf\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sarah\", \"start_time\": \"15:40\", \"end_time\": \"17:30\"}\n- 5:30PM: End of meeting with Sarah\n\nAs for Helen, since she will be at Mission District from 9:45PM to 10:30PM and the minimum required meeting time is 30 minutes, and considering the other friends have been met, we can meet Helen after 7:15PM. \n\n- 7:15PM: Travel to Mission District (11 minutes)\n- 7:26PM: Meet Helen at Mission District\n  {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Helen\", \"start_time\": \"19:26\", \"end_time\": \"20:00\"}\n\nHere is the final meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"09:00\", \"end_time\": \"09:35\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Thomas\", \"start_time\": \"10:03\", \"end_time\": \"13:03\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Sarah\", \"start_time\": \"15:40\", \"end_time\": \"17:30\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Helen\", \"start_time\": \"19:26\", \"end_time\": \"20:00\"}]}",
