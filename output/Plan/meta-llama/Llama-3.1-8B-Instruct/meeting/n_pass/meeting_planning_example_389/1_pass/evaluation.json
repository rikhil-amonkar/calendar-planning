    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the meeting schedule, we need to consider the constraints and the travel distances. The goal is to meet Sarah for at least 105 minutes, Mary for at least 75 minutes, Helen for at least 30 minutes, and Thomas for at least 120 minutes.\n\nFirst, we should meet Thomas, as he is available for the longest period of time. We can meet Thomas at Bayview from 3:15PM to 6:45PM.\n\nNext, we should meet Mary, as she is available for a significant period of time. We can meet Mary at Richmond District from 4:45PM to 6:15PM, after meeting Thomas.\n\nAfter meeting Mary, we should meet Sarah, as she is available for a significant period of time. We can meet Sarah at Fisherman's Wharf from 5:00PM to 6:30PM, after meeting Mary.\n\nFinally, we can meet Helen at Mission District from 10:00PM to 10:30PM.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Thomas\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"22:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The start and end times are in 24-hour format.",
