We will prioritize the longest meeting first, which is with Charles at the Financial District.\n\n1. First, we travel from Bayview to Financial District, which takes 19 minutes. We arrive at Financial District at 9:19 AM.\n2. Since Charles will be at the Financial District from 11:15 AM to 3:00 PM, we wait until 11:15 AM to meet Charles. We spend 120 minutes meeting Charles, and then we leave the Financial District at 1:15 PM.\n3. Next, we travel from Financial District to Pacific Heights, which takes 13 minutes. We arrive at Pacific Heights at 1:28 PM.\n4. We meet Mary at Pacific Heights from 1:28 PM to 2:13 PM, which is within her available time.\n5. After meeting Mary, we travel from Pacific Heights to Haight-Ashbury, which takes 11 minutes. We arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 2:24 PM.\n6. We meet Betty at Haight-Ashbury from 2:24 PM to 4:54 PM, which is within her available time.\n7. After meeting Betty, we travel from Haight-Ashbury to Mission District, which takes 12 minutes. We arrive at Mission District at 5:06 PM.\n8. We don't have enough time to meet Lisa, as she will be at Mission District from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Charles\", \"start_time\": \"11:15\", \"end_time\": \"13:15\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Mary\", \"start_time\": \"13:28\", \"end_time\": \"14:13\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Betty\", \"start_time\": \"14:24\", \"end_time\": \"17:54\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nNote: The schedule is optimized to meet the longest meeting first, which is with Charles, and then the other meetings are scheduled accordingly.",
