We want to meet Carol at Sunset District from 10:15AM to 11:45AM. Since it's a short meeting, we can leave Union Square at 10:00AM to arrive at Sunset District by 10:15AM.\n3. After meeting Carol, we can head to Mission District to meet Rebecca. Rebecca is available from 11:30AM to 8:15PM. We want to meet Rebecca for at least 120 minutes. The earliest we can meet Rebecca is at 11:30AM, so we can leave Sunset District at 11:15AM to arrive at Mission District by 11:30AM.\n4. We need to meet Rebecca for at least 120 minutes. Since Karen is available from 12:45PM to 3:00PM, we can meet Karen during this time. We can leave Mission District at 12:45PM to arrive at Bayview by 1:00PM and meet Karen for 120 minutes.\n5. After meeting Karen, we can head back to Mission District to meet Rebecca for the remaining time. We can leave Bayview at 2:00PM to arrive at Mission District by 2:15PM and meet Rebecca for the remaining time.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since we need to meet Rebecca for at least 120 minutes and we've already met her for 3 hours, we can skip the last meeting with Rebecca. \n\nHere is the final meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
