The travel distance from Bayview to Union Square is 17 minutes, so we can meet Kimberly from 8:00AM to 8:30AM.\n\nNext, we should meet Margaret at Presidio since she is available from 10:15AM to 3:15PM. The travel distance from Bayview to Presidio is 31 minutes, so we can meet Margaret from 10:30AM to 11:00AM.\n\nAfter meeting Margaret, we can travel to North Beach to meet Barbara from 1:45PM to 8:15PM. The travel distance from Presidio to North Beach is 18 minutes, so we can meet Barbara from 2:00PM to 3:00PM, which satisfies the minimum meeting time of 60 minutes.\n\nIn the evening, we can travel to Haight-Ashbury to meet Kevin from 8:00PM to 8:45PM. The travel distance from North Beach to Haight-Ashbury is 18 minutes, so we can meet Kevin from 8:18PM to 8:48PM.\n\nHere is the meeting schedule in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kimberly\", \"start_time\": \"08:00\", \"end_time\": \"08:30\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Margaret\", \"start_time\": \"10:30\", \"end_time\": \"11:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Barbara\", \"start_time\": \"14:00\", \"end_time\": \"15:00\"},\n    {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Kevin\", \"start_time\": \"20:18\", \"end_time\": \"20:48\"}\n  ]\n}",
