    "execution_output": "To solve this problem, we'll consider the constraints and optimize the schedule to meet as many friends as possible.\n\nFirst, let's prioritize meeting Barbara since she's available for the longest duration. We can meet Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15AM to 11:15AM (120 minutes), which is before her availability ends.\n\nNext, we can meet Betty at Presidio from 11:15AM to 12:00PM (45 minutes), since we need to meet her for at least 45 minutes and her availability starts at 10:15AM.\n\nHowever, we need to meet David for at least 90 minutes, which is after 1:00PM. We can meet David at Richmond District from 3:00PM to 5:30PM (2.5 hours), which is the minimum duration required to meet him.\n\nHere's the optimized schedule:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule allows us to meet Barbara for 120 minutes, Betty for 45 minutes, and David for 90 minutes, while considering the travel times between locations.",
