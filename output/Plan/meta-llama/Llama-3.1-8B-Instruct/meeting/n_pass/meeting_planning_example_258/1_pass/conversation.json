We can meet Barbara at Fisherman's Wharf from 9:15AM to 11:15AM (120 minutes), which is before her availability ends.\n\nNext, we can meet Betty at Presidio from 11:15AM to 12:00PM (45 minutes), since we need to meet her for at least 45 minutes and her availability starts at 10:15AM.\n\nHowever, we need to meet David for at least 90 minutes, which is after 1:00PM. We can meet David at Richmond District from 3:00PM to 5:30PM (2.5 hours), which is the minimum duration required to meet him.\n\nHere's the optimized schedule:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"David\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule allows us to meet Barbara for 120 minutes, Betty for 45 minutes, and David for 90 minutes, while considering the travel times between locations."
