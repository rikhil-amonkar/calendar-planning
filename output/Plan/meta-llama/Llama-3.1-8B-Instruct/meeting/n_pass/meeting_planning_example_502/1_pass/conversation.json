Meet Joseph at Pacific Heights from 8:15AM to 9:15AM (since we need to meet him for at least 60 minutes and his meeting ends at 9:30AM, we should start early to meet the 60 minutes requirement).\n\n2. After meeting Joseph, we need to go to Rebecca who is at Fisherman's Wharf from 8:00AM to 11:15AM. However, we can't meet her at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:15AM because her meeting time starts at 8:00AM. We can't meet her earlier because we have to meet Joseph for 60 minutes. We need to go to Fisherman's Wharf first and then meet Rebecca from 9:15AM to 10:45AM (to meet her for at least 30 minutes).\n\n3. Next, we need to go to Stephanie who is at Golden Gate Park from 11:00AM to 3:00PM. We can't meet her at Golden Gate Park at 10:45AM because her meeting time starts at 11:00AM. We can go to Golden Gate Park and meet her from 11:00AM to 1:00PM (to meet her for at least 105 minutes).\n\n4. After meeting Stephanie, we need to go to Karen who is at Chinatown from 1:45PM to 4:30PM. We can go to Chinatown and meet her from 1:45PM to 2:00PM (to meet her for at least 15 minutes).\n\n5. Finally, we need to go to Brian who is at Union Square from 3:00PM to 5:15PM. We can go to Union Square and meet him from 3:00PM to 4:30PM (to meet him for at least 30 minutes).\n\n6. We still have time to meet Steven who is at North Beach from 2:30PM to 8:45PM.
