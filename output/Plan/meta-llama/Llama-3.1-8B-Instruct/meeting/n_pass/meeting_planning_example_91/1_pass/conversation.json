Since we arrive at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM and want to meet Daniel for a minimum of 75 minutes, let's start by meeting Daniel.\n\nWe know Daniel will be at Richmond District from 7:00 PM to 8:15 PM. To meet Daniel for at least 75 minutes, we should arrive at Richmond District by 6:45 PM. \n\nWe can visit the Richmond District before meeting Daniel. Since the travel distance is 14 minutes, we can visit the Richmond District at 6:00 PM, meet Daniel, and then head back to Russian Hill.\n\nHowever, we can do better by considering other friends. Let's assume we can meet other friends at the Richmond District before meeting Daniel. \n\nWe can visit the Richmond District at 10:00 AM and meet someone there. We can then head back to Russian Hill, meet someone else, and then visit the Richmond District again.\n\nHere's a possible schedule:\n\n1. 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Meet Sarah at Richmond District.\n2. 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Head back to Russian Hill and meet John.\n3. 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Have lunch.\n4. 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM: Visit the Richmond District and meet Emily.\n5. 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Head back to Russian Hill and meet Michael.\n6. 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Visit the Richmond District and get ready to meet Daniel.\n7. 7:00 PM - 8:15 PM: Meet Daniel at Richmond District.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"John\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"free\",\n      \"person\": \"N/A\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Emily\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Michael\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"free\",\n      \"person\": \"N/A\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Daniel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule allows us to meet Sarah, John, Emily, Michael, and Daniel, maximizing the number of friends we can meet in a day."
