Since you arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM and need to travel to Nob Hill (which takes 11 minutes), you can plan to arrive at Nob Hill just in time for the meeting with Kenneth. \n\nHere\u2019s the JSON itinerary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- You arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. \n- Kenneth is available at Nob Hill from 2:15 PM to 7:45 PM. \n- The earliest you can meet Kenneth is at 2:15 PM, and the meeting lasts for 90 minutes (until 3:45 PM). \n- The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes, but since you have ample time before the meeting, you can leave Fisherman's Wharf at any time that ensures you arrive at Nob Hill by 2:15 PM. \n\nThis schedule maximizes the time spent with Kenneth while adhering to the constraints.",
