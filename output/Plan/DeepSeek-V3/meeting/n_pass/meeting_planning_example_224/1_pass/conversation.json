        "content": "SOLUTION: To optimize meeting as many friends as possible within the given constraints, we need to schedule meetings with Melissa, Nancy, and Emily while accounting for travel times. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n1. Start at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Melissa (25 minutes travel, arrive at 9:25 AM). Meet Melissa for 15 minutes (9:25 AM - 9:40 AM).\n3. Travel from Golden Gate Park to Richmond District (7 minutes travel, arrive at 9:47 AM). However, Emily is only available from 4:45 PM, so this won't work. Instead, we can stay at Golden Gate Park until closer to Emily's availability.\n4. Alternatively, after meeting Melissa, we can travel to Presidio to meet Nancy, but Nancy is only available from 7:45 PM, which is too early. \n5. The best approach is to meet Melissa first, then travel to Richmond District to meet Emily, and finally travel to Presidio to meet Nancy.\n\nHere's the detailed schedule:\n\n- Meet Melissa at Golden Gate Park from 9:25 AM to 9:40 AM (15 minutes).\n- Travel to Richmond District (7 minutes, arrive at 9:47 AM). Emily is not available until 4:45 PM, so we have to wait or do something else. This is not optimal.\n  \nInstead, let's adjust:\n\n- Meet Melissa at Golden Gate Park from 9:25 AM to 9:40 AM (15 minutes).\n- Stay at Golden Gate Park until closer to Emily's availability, then travel to Richmond District at 4:38 PM (7 minutes travel, arrive at 4:45 PM).\n- Meet Emily from 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM (120 minutes).\n- Travel to Presidio (7 minutes, arrive at 6:52 PM).\n- Meet Nancy from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM (105 minutes).\n\nFinal schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:25\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:40\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Emily\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
