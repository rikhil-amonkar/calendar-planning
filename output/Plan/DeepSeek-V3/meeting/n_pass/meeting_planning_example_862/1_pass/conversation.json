Travel time to Presidio is 10 minutes (arrive at 10:55 AM, but Brian is available at 10:15 AM, so adjust to meet Brian first after Elizabeth).\n   \n   Wait, this seems conflicting.

This doesn't work, so adjust to meet Brian later.\n  \nBetter schedule:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Deborah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Explanation:\n1. **Elizabeth (Marina District)**: Start at 9:00 AM, meet until 10:45 AM (105 minutes).\n2. **Stephanie (North Beach)**: Travel from Marina to North Beach (11 minutes), arrive at 10:56 AM, meet from 11:15 AM to 12:30 PM (75 minutes).\n3. **Helen (Golden Gate Park)**: Travel from North Beach to Golden Gate Park (23 minutes), arrive at 12:53 PM, meet from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM (120 minutes).\n4. **Laura (Alamo Square)**: Travel from Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square (9 minutes), arrive at 3:09 PM, meet from 3:15 PM to 4:30 PM (75 minutes).\n5. **Mary (Embarcadero)**: Travel from Alamo Square to Embarcadero (16 minutes), arrive at 4:46 PM, meet from 4:45 PM to 6:45 PM (120 minutes).\n6. **Karen (Russian Hill)**: Travel from Embarcadero to Russian Hill (8 minutes), arrive at 6:53 PM, meet from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM (90 minutes).\n7. **Deborah (Financial District)**: Travel from Russian Hill to Financial District (11 minutes), arrive at 8:41 PM, meet from 8:45 PM to 10:30 PM (105 minutes, but Deborah is only available until 8:45 PM). \n\nThis doesn't work for Deborah. Adjust Karen's meeting to end at 8:15 PM (her availability), then meet Deborah from 8:15 PM to 10:00 PM (but Deborah is only available until 8:45 PM). \n\nFinal corrected schedule:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- Deborah cannot be met due to time constraints (her window is too short after Karen).\n- Sandra (Richmond District) is skipped due to time constraints.\n- Stephanie (North Beach) is skipped to prioritize others.\n- This schedule meets 6 friends (Elizabeth, Brian, Helen, Laura, Mary, Karen) while satisfying all constraints except Deborah and Sandra."
