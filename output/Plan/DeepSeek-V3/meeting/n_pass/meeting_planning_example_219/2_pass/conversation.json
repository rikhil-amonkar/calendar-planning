Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Location and Time**: Start at The Castro at 9:00 AM.\n2. **Meet Emily at Alamo Square**:\n   - Emily is available from 11:45 AM to 3:15 PM.\n   - Minimum meeting time: 105 minutes (1 hour 45 minutes).\n   - Travel time from The Castro to Alamo Square: 8 minutes.\n   - To maximize time with Emily, arrive at Alamo Square at 11:45 AM (leave The Castro at 11:37 AM).\n   - Meet Emily from 11:45 AM to 1:30 PM (105 minutes).\n3. **Travel to Union Square to meet Barbara**:\n   - Barbara is available from 4:45 PM to 6:15 PM.\n   - Minimum meeting time: 60 minutes.\n   - Travel time from Alamo Square to Union Square: 14 minutes.\n   - Leave Alamo Square at 1:30 PM, arrive at Union Square at 1:44 PM.\n   - Since Barbara isn't available until 4:45 PM, we have free time until then.\n   - Meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:45 PM (60 minutes).\n4. **Travel to Chinatown to meet William**:\n   - William is available from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM.\n   - Minimum meeting time: 105 minutes.\n   - Travel time from Union Square to Chinatown: 7 minutes.\n   - Leave Union Square at 5:45 PM, arrive at Chinatown at 5:52 PM.\n   - Meet William from 5:52 PM to 7:00 PM (68 minutes). \n   - This doesn't meet the 105-minute requirement, so we need to adjust.\n\n### Revised Schedule:\nTo meet William for 105 minutes, we must arrive at Chinatown by 5:15 PM (his start time) and leave at 7:00 PM (his end time). This means:\n- Leave Union Square by 5:08 PM (7 minutes travel time to Chinatown).\n- Meet Barbara from 4:45 PM to 5:08 PM (23 minutes), which doesn't meet the 60-minute requirement.\n\nThis conflict means we cannot meet all three friends for the minimum required times. Therefore, we must prioritize two friends and adjust the third meeting. \n\n### Optimal Schedule:\nPrioritize Emily and William, as their minimum meeting times are longer. Skip Barbara.\n\n1.
