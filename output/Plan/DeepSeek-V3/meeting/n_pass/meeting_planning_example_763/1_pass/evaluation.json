    "execution_output": "To solve this problem, we need to create a schedule that maximizes the number of friends you can meet while respecting the time constraints and travel times between locations. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **List all friends with their availability and minimum meeting times**:\n   - Richard (Embarcadero): 3:15PM - 6:45PM (min 90 mins)\n   - Mark (Pacific Heights): 3:00PM - 5:00PM (min 45 mins)\n   - Matthew (Russian Hill): 5:30PM - 9:00PM (min 90 mins)\n   - Rebecca (Haight-Ashbury): 2:45PM - 6:00PM (min 60 mins)\n   - Melissa (Golden Gate Park): 1:45PM - 5:30PM (min 90 mins)\n   - Margaret (Fisherman's Wharf): 2:45PM - 8:15PM (min 15 mins)\n   - Emily (Sunset District): 3:45PM - 5:00PM (min 45 mins)\n   - George (The Castro): 2:00PM - 4:15PM (min 75 mins)\n\n2. **Prioritize friends with tighter time windows or longer minimum meeting times**:\n   - George (The Castro) has a tight window (2:00PM - 4:15PM) and a long minimum meeting time (75 mins). This should be scheduled early.\n   - Melissa (Golden Gate Park) has a long availability but a long minimum meeting time (90 mins). Schedule after George.\n   - Rebecca (Haight-Ashbury) has a medium window and a medium minimum meeting time (60 mins). Schedule after Melissa.\n   - Mark (Pacific Heights) has a short window (3:00PM - 5:00PM) and a medium minimum meeting time (45 mins). Schedule after Rebecca.\n   - Richard (Embarcadero) has a long window but a long minimum meeting time (90 mins). Schedule after Mark.\n   - Matthew (Russian Hill) has a long window but a long minimum meeting time (90 mins). Schedule last.\n   - Emily (Sunset District) has a very short window (3:45PM - 5:00PM) and a medium minimum meeting time (45 mins). Try to fit in if possible.\n   - Margaret (Fisherman's Wharf) has a long window and a very short minimum meeting time (15 mins). Can be fit in flexibly.\n\n3. **Build the schedule**:\n   - Start at Chinatown at 9:00AM. The first meeting is George at The Castro at 2:00PM. Travel time from Chinatown to The Castro is 22 mins, so leave Chinatown at 1:38PM to arrive by 2:00PM.\n   - Meet George from 2:00PM - 3:15PM (75 mins).\n   - Next, meet Melissa at Golden Gate Park. Travel time from The Castro to Golden Gate Park is 11 mins, so leave The Castro at 3:15PM, arrive at Golden Gate Park by 3:26PM. Meet Melissa from 3:26PM - 4:56PM (90 mins).\n   - Next, meet Rebecca at Haight-Ashbury. Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Haight-Ashbury is 7 mins, so leave Golden Gate Park at 4:56PM, arrive at Haight-Ashbury by 5:03PM. Meet Rebecca from 5:03PM - 6:00PM (57 mins, but this is less than the desired 60 mins. Adjust to leave Golden Gate Park earlier at 4:50PM to arrive by 4:57PM, meet Rebecca from 4:57PM - 6:00PM (63 mins).\n   - Next, meet Matthew at Russian Hill. Travel time from Haight-Ashbury to Russian Hill is 17 mins, so leave Haight-Ashbury at 6:00PM, arrive at Russian Hill by 6:17PM. Meet Matthew from 6:17PM - 7:47PM (90 mins).\n   - This schedule misses Mark, Richard, Emily, and Margaret. Let's try another approach.\n\n4. **Alternative schedule**:\n   - Meet George at The Castro from 2:00PM - 3:15PM (75 mins).\n   - Travel to Golden Gate Park (11 mins), arrive by 3:26PM. Meet Melissa from 3:26PM - 4:56PM (90 mins).\n   - Travel to Haight-Ashbury (7 mins), arrive by 5:03PM. Meet Rebecca from 5:03PM - 6:00PM (57 mins).\n   - Travel to Russian Hill (17 mins), arrive by 6:17PM. Meet Matthew from 6:17PM - 7:47PM (90 mins).\n   - This still misses others. Let's try prioritizing Richard and Mark.\n\n5. **Final schedule**:\n   - Meet George at The Castro from 2:00PM - 3:15PM (75 mins).\n   - Travel to Pacific Heights (16 mins), arrive by 3:31PM. Meet Mark from 3:31PM - 4:16PM (45 mins).\n   - Travel to Embarcadero (10 mins), arrive by 4:26PM. Meet Richard from 4:26PM - 5:56PM (90 mins).\n   - Travel to Russian Hill (8 mins), arrive by 6:04PM. Meet Matthew from 6:04PM - 7:34PM (90 mins).\n   - This meets George, Mark, Richard, and Matthew. Let's try to fit in Melissa.\n\n6. **Best possible schedule** (meets 5 friends):\n   - Meet George at The Castro from 2:00PM - 3:15PM (75 mins).\n   - Travel to Golden Gate Park (11 mins), arrive by 3:26PM. Meet Melissa from 3:26PM - 4:56PM (90 mins).\n   - Travel to Pacific Heights (16 mins), arrive by 5:12PM. Meet Mark from 5:12PM - 5:57PM (45 mins, but Mark's window ends at 5:00PM. Not possible. Adjust).\n   - Instead, after Melissa, travel to Haight-Ashbury (7 mins), arrive by 5:03PM. Meet Rebecca from 5:03PM - 6:00PM (57 mins).\n   - Travel to Russian Hill (17 mins), arrive by 6:17PM. Meet Matthew from 6:17PM - 7:47PM (90 mins).\n   - This meets George, Melissa, Rebecca, and Matthew.\n\n   The optimal schedule meets 4 friends.
