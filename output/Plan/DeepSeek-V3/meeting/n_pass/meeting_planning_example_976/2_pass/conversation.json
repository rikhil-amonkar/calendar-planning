Added meetings with Sarah and Charles\n2. Adjusted meeting times to fit all 10 friends\n3. Maintained all minimum meeting durations\n4. Kept meetings within each friend's availability window\n\nNote that this schedule still requires staying out very late to meet all friends. If this isn't practical, we might need to prioritize some friends over others or reduce some meeting durations below the requested minimums."
