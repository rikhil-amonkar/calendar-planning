Met with all 9 friends as required\n\nThe schedule now meets all constraints while optimizing the order to minimize travel time between locations. Key adjustments:\n- Shortened some meetings slightly to fit Melissa in\n- Pushed back Robert's meeting to allow time for Melissa\n- Adjusted David and Mark's meetings accordingly\n- Kept evening meetings (Deborah, Karen, Laura) at same times since they're time-constrained"
