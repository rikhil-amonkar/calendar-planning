    "execution_output": "To solve this problem, we need to create a schedule that allows us to meet both Jason and Kenneth for the minimum required durations while accounting for travel times between locations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Location**: Start at Pacific Heights at 9:00 AM.\n2. **Meet Jason at Presidio**: \n   - Travel time from Pacific Heights to Presidio: 11 minutes.\n   - Earliest arrival at Presidio: 9:11 AM, but Jason is only available from 10:00 AM to 4:15 PM.\n   - To meet Jason for 90 minutes, the latest we can start the meeting is 2:45 PM (since 2:45 PM + 90 minutes = 4:15 PM).\n   - Let's aim to meet Jason from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (90 minutes).\n   - Depart Pacific Heights at 9:49 AM to arrive at Presidio by 10:00 AM (9:49 AM + 11 minutes = 10:00 AM).\n3. **Meet Kenneth at Marina District**:\n   - Kenneth is available from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM, and we need to meet for 45 minutes.\n   - Latest we can start the meeting is 4:00 PM (4:00 PM + 45 minutes = 4:45 PM).\n   - Travel time from Presidio to Marina District: 10 minutes.\n   - To arrive at Marina District by 3:30 PM, we must leave Presidio by 3:20 PM (3:20 PM + 10 minutes = 3:30 PM).\n   - However, we are meeting Jason until 11:30 AM, so we have time to return to Pacific Heights or go directly to Marina District later.\n   - Alternative: After meeting Jason, go to Marina District directly:\n     - Leave Presidio at 11:30 AM, arrive at Marina District at 11:40 AM (11:30 AM + 10 minutes = 11:40 AM).\n     - Kenneth is not available until 3:30 PM, so this is too early.\n   - Better: After meeting Jason, return to Pacific Heights, then go to Marina District later:\n     - Leave Presidio at 11:30 AM, arrive at Pacific Heights at 11:41 AM (11:30 AM + 11 minutes = 11:41 AM).\n     - Then, leave Pacific Heights at 3:23 PM to arrive at Marina District by 3:30 PM (3:23 PM + 7 minutes = 3:30 PM).\n     - Meet Kenneth from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM (45 minutes).\n\n### Final Schedule:\n- Meet Jason from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM at Presidio.\n- Travel to Pacific Heights (arrive by 11:41 AM).\n- Travel to Marina District (arrive by 3:30 PM).\n- Meet Kenneth from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM at Marina District.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
