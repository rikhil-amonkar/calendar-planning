    "execution_output": "To solve this problem, we need to create a schedule that allows us to meet all three friends (David, Timothy, and Robert) while respecting the time constraints and travel times between locations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Location**: Start at the Financial District at 9:00 AM.\n2. **Timothy's Availability**: Timothy is available from 9:00 AM to 3:30 PM in Pacific Heights. Since we start at the Financial District, we can go directly to Pacific Heights (13 minutes travel time) and meet Timothy first.\n   - Depart Financial District at 9:00 AM, arrive at Pacific Heights at 9:13 AM.\n   - Meet Timothy for 75 minutes: 9:13 AM to 10:28 AM.\n3. **David's Availability**: David is available from 10:45 AM to 3:30 PM in Fisherman's Wharf. After meeting Timothy, we need to travel from Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf (13 minutes travel time).\n   - Depart Pacific Heights at 10:28 AM, arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 10:41 AM.\n   - David is available at 10:45 AM, so wait until 10:45 AM.\n   - Meet David for 15 minutes: 10:45 AM to 11:00 AM.\n4. **Robert's Availability**: Robert is available from 12:15 PM to 7:45 PM in the Mission District. After meeting David, we can travel to the Mission District (22 minutes travel time).\n   - Depart Fisherman's Wharf at 11:00 AM, arrive at Mission District at 11:22 AM.\n   - Robert is not available until 12:15 PM, so wait until 12:15 PM.\n   - Meet Robert for 90 minutes: 12:15 PM to 1:45 PM.\n\nThis schedule meets all constraints and allows us to meet all three friends.
