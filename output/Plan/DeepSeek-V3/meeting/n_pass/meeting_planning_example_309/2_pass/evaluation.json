    "execution_output": "To meet all four friends (Nancy, Mary, Jessica, and Rebecca), we must adjust the schedule to include Rebecca, even though her availability is early in the day. Since we arrive at the Financial District at 9:00 AM and Rebecca is only available from 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM, we cannot meet her under the current constraints. \n\nHowever, if we assume that the arrival time at the Financial District is flexible (or that we can start earlier), here\u2019s a revised schedule that includes all four friends:\n\n### Revised Schedule (Assuming Early Start):\n1. **Meet Rebecca at Fisherman's Wharf (7:00 AM - 8:30 AM)**:\n   - Arrive at Fisherman's Wharf by 7:00 AM (starting earlier than 9:00 AM).\n   - Meet Rebecca from 7:00 AM to 7:45 AM (45 minutes).\n   - Travel to Financial District (11 minutes). Arrive at 7:56 AM.\n   - Wait at Financial District until 9:00 AM (original arrival time).\n\n2. **Proceed with the original plan**:\n   - Travel to Chinatown (5 minutes). Arrive at 9:05 AM.\n   - Meet Nancy from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM (90 minutes).\n   - Travel to Bayview (22 minutes). Arrive at 11:22 AM.\n   - Meet Jessica from 11:22 AM to 12:07 PM (45 minutes).\n   - Travel to Alamo Square (16 minutes). Arrive at 12:23 PM.\n   - Meet Mary from 12:23 PM to 1:38 PM (75 minutes).\n\n### JSON Schedule:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"07:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"07:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:22\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:07\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:23\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:38\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Key Assumption:\n- You can start your day earlier (before 9:00 AM) to meet Rebecca. If this is not possible, then meeting all four friends is impossible under the given constraints. \n\n### If Early Start is Not Allowed:\nIf you *must* start at 9:00 AM in the Financial District and cannot meet Rebecca, then the original solution (meeting Nancy, Jessica, and Mary) is the only feasible option. The constraint \"must meet with exactly 4 people\" cannot be satisfied without violating Rebecca's availability. \n\n### Final Answer (Assuming Flexibility):\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"07:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"07:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:22\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:07\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:23\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:38\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nIf the 9:00 AM arrival is strict, please clarify, and I will provide an alternative solution. Otherwise, this schedule meets all four friends by starting earlier.",
