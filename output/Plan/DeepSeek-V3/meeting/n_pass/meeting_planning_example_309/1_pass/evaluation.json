    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible within the given constraints, we need to carefully plan the order of visits and ensure that travel times and meeting durations are accounted for. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n1. Start at the Financial District at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Chinatown (5 minutes) to meet Nancy. Arrive at 9:05 AM, but Nancy is only available from 9:30 AM. So, wait until 9:30 AM and meet Nancy until 11:00 AM (90 minutes).\n3. Travel to Bayview from Chinatown (22 minutes). Arrive at 11:22 AM, but Jessica is available from 11:15 AM to 1:45 PM. Meet Jessica from 11:22 AM to 12:07 PM (45 minutes).\n4. Travel to Alamo Square from Bayview (16 minutes). Arrive at 12:23 PM. Meet Mary from 12:23 PM to 1:38 PM (75 minutes).\n5. Rebecca is only available from 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM, which is before our arrival in the Financial District, so we cannot meet her.\n\nHere is the schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:22\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:07\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:23\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:38\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule allows us to meet Nancy, Jessica, and Mary while satisfying all constraints. Rebecca cannot be met due to her availability being before our arrival.",
