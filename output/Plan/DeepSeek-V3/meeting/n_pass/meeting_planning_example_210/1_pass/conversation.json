        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to schedule meetings with Emily, Joseph, and Melissa while considering travel times and their availability. The goal is to meet all three friends while satisfying the minimum meeting durations and travel constraints. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: You start at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. The earliest meeting is with Melissa at the Financial District at 3:45 PM, so you have free time until then. However, we can optimize the schedule to meet all friends.\n\n2. **Travel Times**:\n   - Fisherman's Wharf to Financial District: 11 minutes.\n   - Financial District to Presidio: 22 minutes.\n   - Presidio to Richmond District: 7 minutes.\n   - Richmond District to Financial District: 22 minutes (but not needed here).\n\n3. **Meeting Durations**:\n   - Melissa: 75 minutes (Financial District, 3:45 PM - 9:45 PM).\n   - Emily: 105 minutes (Presidio, 4:15 PM - 9:00 PM).\n   - Joseph: 120 minutes (Richmond District, 5:15 PM - 10:00 PM).\n\n4. **Optimal Schedule**:\n   - First, meet Melissa at Financial District from 3:45 PM to 5:00 PM (75 minutes).\n   - Travel from Financial District to Presidio (22 minutes), arriving at 5:22 PM.\n   - Meet Emily from 5:22 PM to 7:07 PM (105 minutes).\n   - Travel from Presidio to Richmond District (7 minutes), arriving at 7:14 PM.\n   - Meet Joseph from 7:14 PM to 9:14 PM (120 minutes).\n\nThis schedule meets all constraints and ensures you meet all three friends for the required durations.\n\n### SOLUTION:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Melissa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Emily\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:22\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:07\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:14\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:14\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
