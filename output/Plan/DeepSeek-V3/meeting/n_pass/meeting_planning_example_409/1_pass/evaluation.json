    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible while satisfying the minimum meeting durations, we can follow this itinerary:\n\n1. Start at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM. Since Laura is available at Nob Hill from 8:45 AM to 4:15 PM, we can meet her first. The travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill is 11 minutes, so we can arrive at Nob Hill by 9:11 AM. Meet Laura for 30 minutes until 9:41 AM.\n\n2. From Nob Hill, we can travel to Embarcadero to meet Patricia later in the evening. However, Patricia is only available from 5:30 PM, so we have time to meet others first. \n\n3. Next, we can travel to Bayview to meet Thomas. The travel time from Nob Hill to Bayview is 19 minutes, so we can arrive at Bayview by 10:00 AM. However, Thomas is only available from 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM, so we cannot meet him now. Instead, we can plan to meet him later in the afternoon.\n\n4. Since Laura is still available at Nob Hill until 4:15 PM, we can return to Nob Hill to meet her again if needed, but it's better to plan for other friends.\n\n5. Next, we can travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Stephanie in the evening. The travel time from Nob Hill to Golden Gate Park is 17 minutes, but Stephanie is only available from 6:30 PM, so we cannot meet her now.\n\n6. Alternatively, we can travel to Marina District to meet Betty in the evening. The travel time from Nob Hill to Marina District is 11 minutes, but Betty is only available from 6:45 PM, so we cannot meet her now.\n\n7. Given the constraints, the best plan is to meet Laura first, then wait until the afternoon to meet Thomas, followed by Patricia, Betty, and Stephanie in the evening.\n\nHere is the optimized schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:11\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:41\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"Nob Hill\",\n      \"to\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:41\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Thomas\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"to\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:49\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Patricia\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:49\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:34\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"to\": \"Marina District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:34\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:46\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:46\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:31\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"Marina District\",\n      \"to\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:31\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:47\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:47\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:17\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule meets all the minimum duration requirements for each friend and optimizes travel time between locations.",
