Travel time to next destination (Joshua at Financial District) is 23 minutes (from Presidio to Financial District), arriving at 1:08 PM. However, Joshua is only available from 2:30 PM, so there's a gap.\n3. **Joshua (Financial District)**: Meet from 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM (90 minutes). Travel time to next destination (Mary at Marina District) is 15 minutes (from Financial District to Marina District), arriving at 4:15 PM.\n4. **Mary (Marina District)**: Meet from 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM (45 minutes). Travel time to next destination (Patricia at Nob Hill) is 11 minutes (from Marina District to Nob Hill), arriving at 4:56 PM.\n5. **Patricia (Nob Hill)**: Meet from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM (120 minutes). Travel time to next destination (Charles at Richmond District) is 14 minutes (from Nob Hill to Richmond District), arriving at 7:14 PM.\n6. **Charles (Richmond District)**: Meet from 7:15 PM to 7:30 PM (15 minutes).
