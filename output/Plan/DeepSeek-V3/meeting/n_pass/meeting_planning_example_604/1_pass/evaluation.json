    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the schedule to meet as many friends as possible while respecting the constraints, we need to carefully plan the order of visits and travel times. Here's the optimal itinerary:\n\n1. **Meet William at Embarcadero**: Since William is only available from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and we arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM, we cannot meet William because his availability ends at 9:00 AM. This meeting is impossible given the constraints.\n\n2. **Meet Stephanie at Nob Hill**: Stephanie is available from 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM. We can leave Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM and arrive at Nob Hill at 9:11 AM (11-minute travel time). We can meet her from 9:11 AM to 9:56 AM (45 minutes).\n\n3. **Meet Joseph at Alamo Square**: Joseph is available from 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM. We can leave Nob Hill at 9:56 AM and arrive at Alamo Square at 10:07 AM (11-minute travel time). However, Joseph isn't available until 11:30 AM, so we have free time until then. We can meet him from 11:30 AM to 11:45 AM (15 minutes).\n\n4. **Meet Karen at Russian Hill**: Karen is available from 2:30 PM to 7:45 PM. We can leave Alamo Square at 11:45 AM and arrive at Russian Hill at 11:58 AM (13-minute travel time). However, Karen isn't available until 2:30 PM, so we have free time until then. We can meet her from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM (30 minutes).\n\n5. **Meet Kimberly at North Beach**: Kimberly is available from 3:45 PM to 7:15 PM. We can leave Russian Hill at 3:00 PM and arrive at North Beach at 3:05 PM (5-minute travel time). We can meet her from 3:05 PM to 3:35 PM (30 minutes).\n\n6. **Meet Laura at The Castro**: Laura is available from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM. We can leave North Beach at 3:35 PM and arrive at The Castro at 3:57 PM (22-minute travel time). However, Laura isn't available until 7:45 PM, so we have free time until then. We can meet her from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM (105 minutes).\n\n7. **Meet Daniel at Golden Gate Park**: Daniel is available from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. We can leave The Castro at 9:30 PM and arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:41 PM (11-minute travel time). We can meet him from 9:41 PM to 9:45 PM (4 minutes), but this doesn't meet the minimum 15-minute requirement. Therefore, this meeting is not feasible.\n\n### Final Itinerary:\nWe can meet Stephanie, Joseph, Karen, Kimberly, and Laura. The meeting with Daniel is not feasible, and the meeting with William is impossible due to timing constraints.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:11\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:56\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:05\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:35\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
