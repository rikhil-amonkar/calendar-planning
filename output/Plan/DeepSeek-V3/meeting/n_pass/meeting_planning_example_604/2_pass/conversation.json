Here's the optimal itinerary:\n\n1. **Meet William at Embarcadero**: Since William is only available from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and we arrive at Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM, we cannot meet William because his availability ends at 9:00 AM. This meeting is impossible given the constraints.\n\n2. **Meet Stephanie at Nob Hill**: Stephanie is available from 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM. We can leave Fisherman's Wharf at 9:00 AM and arrive at Nob Hill at 9:11 AM (11-minute travel time). We can meet her from 9:11 AM to 9:56 AM (45 minutes).\n\n3. **Meet Joseph at Alamo Square**: Joseph is available from 11:30 AM to 12:45 PM. We can leave Nob Hill at 9:56 AM and arrive at Alamo Square at 10:07 AM (11-minute travel time). However, Joseph isn't available until 11:30 AM, so we have free time until then. We can meet him from 11:30 AM to 11:45 AM (15 minutes).\n\n4. **Meet Karen at Russian Hill**: Karen is available from 2:30 PM to 7:45 PM. We can leave Alamo Square at 11:45 AM and arrive at Russian Hill at 11:58 AM (13-minute travel time). However, Karen isn't available until 2:30 PM, so we have free time until then. We can meet her from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM (30 minutes).\n\n5. **Meet Kimberly at North Beach**: Kimberly is available from 3:45 PM to 7:15 PM. We can leave Russian Hill at 3:00 PM and arrive at North Beach at 3:05 PM (5-minute travel time). We can meet her from 3:05 PM to 3:35 PM (30 minutes).\n\n6. **Meet Laura at The Castro**: Laura is available from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM. We can leave North Beach at 3:35 PM and arrive at The Castro at 3:57 PM (22-minute travel time). However, Laura isn't available until 7:45 PM, so we have free time until then. We can meet her from 7:45 PM to 9:30 PM (105 minutes).\n\n7. **Meet Daniel at Golden Gate Park**: Daniel is available from 9:15 PM to 9:45 PM. We can leave The Castro at 9:30 PM and arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:41 PM (11-minute travel time). We can meet him from 9:41 PM to 9:45 PM (4 minutes), but this doesn't meet the minimum 15-minute requirement. Therefore, this meeting is not feasible.\n\n### Final Itinerary:\nWe can meet Stephanie, Joseph, Karen, Kimberly, and Laura.
