    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize meeting as many friends as possible while respecting the constraints, we need to carefully plan the schedule considering travel times and meeting durations. Here's the optimal itinerary:\n\n1. Start at Financial District at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet Joseph at Pacific Heights (60 min): Since Joseph is only available until 9:30 AM, we need to leave immediately to meet him. Travel time is 13 min, so we arrive at 9:13 AM and meet until 10:13 AM.\n3. Meet Rebecca at Fisherman's Wharf (30 min): Travel time from Pacific Heights to Fisherman's Wharf is 13 min, so we arrive at 10:26 AM. Rebecca is available until 11:15 AM, so we can meet from 10:26 AM to 10:56 AM.\n4. Meet Stephanie at Golden Gate Park (105 min): Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Golden Gate Park is 25 min, so we arrive at 11:21 AM. Stephanie is available until 3:00 PM, so we can meet from 11:21 AM to 1:06 PM.\n5. Meet Karen at Chinatown (15 min): Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Chinatown is 23 min, so we arrive at 1:29 PM. Karen is available until 4:30 PM, so we can meet from 1:29 PM to 1:44 PM.\n6. Meet Steven at North Beach (120 min): Travel time from Chinatown to North Beach is 3 min, so we arrive at 1:47 PM. Steven is available until 8:45 PM, so we can meet from 1:47 PM to 3:47 PM.\n7. Meet Brian at Union Square (30 min): Travel time from North Beach to Union Square is 7 min, so we arrive at 3:54 PM. Brian is available until 5:15 PM, so we can meet from 3:54 PM to 4:24 PM.\n\nHere is the itinerary in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:13\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:13\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:26\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:56\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:21\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:06\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:29\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:44\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Steven\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:47\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:47\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:54\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:24\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule meets all friends while satisfying the minimum meeting duration constraints.",
