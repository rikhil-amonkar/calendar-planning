Here's the best schedule:\n\n1. Start at the Financial District at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Barbara first, as she is available all day, and Kenneth's window is later.\n   - Travel time: 23 minutes (Financial District to Golden Gate Park).\n   - Arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:23 AM.\n   - Meet Barbara for 45 minutes (minimum requirement): 9:23 AM to 10:08 AM.\n3. Travel to Chinatown to meet Kenneth.\n   - Travel time: 23 minutes (Golden Gate Park to Chinatown).\n   - Arrive at Chinatown at 10:31 AM.\n   - Kenneth is available from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, so we must wait until 12:00 PM to meet him.\n   - Meet Kenneth for 90 minutes (minimum requirement): 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM.\n\nThis schedule ensures you meet both friends for the minimum required time without overlapping their availability windows.\n\nJSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:23\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:08\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
