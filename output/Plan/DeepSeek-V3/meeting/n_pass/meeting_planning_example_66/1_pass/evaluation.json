You arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel from Nob Hill to Presidio takes 17 minutes, so you can leave Nob Hill at 10:58 AM to arrive at Presidio by 11:15 AM (when Robert becomes available).\n3. Meet Robert from 11:15 AM to 1:15 PM (120 minutes).\n4. Travel back from Presidio to Nob Hill takes 18 minutes, so you can leave Presidio at 1:15 PM and arrive at Nob Hill by 1:33 PM.\n\nHere\u2019s the JSON representation of the itinerary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule ensures you meet Robert for the minimum required 120 minutes while accounting for travel time. No other friends are mentioned, so this is the only meeting scheduled.",
