Since you arrive at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM and it takes 7 minutes to travel to Pacific Heights, you can arrive at Pacific Heights by 9:07 AM. Barbara is available until 10:00 PM, so you can meet her for the required 60 minutes starting at 9:07 AM.\n\nHere\u2019s the JSON representation of the itinerary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:07\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:07\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
