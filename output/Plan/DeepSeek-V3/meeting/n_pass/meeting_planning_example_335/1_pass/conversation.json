        "content": "SOLUTION:\nTo optimize meeting as many friends as possible, we need to consider the following constraints and travel times:\n\n1. **Helen (North Beach)**: Available 9:00AM-5:00PM, minimum 15 minutes. Since you start at Pacific Heights at 9:00AM, you can meet Helen first (travel time: 9 minutes). Earliest start time: 9:09AM. Let's meet her for 15 minutes (9:09AM-9:24AM).\n2. **Kevin (Mission District)**: Available 10:45AM-2:45PM, minimum 45 minutes. Travel time from North Beach to Mission District: 18 minutes. Earliest arrival: 9:24AM + 18 minutes = 9:42AM. Kevin is available at 10:45AM, so you can wait until then. Meet Kevin from 10:45AM-11:30AM (45 minutes).\n3. **Betty (Financial District)**: Available 7:00PM-9:45PM, minimum 90 minutes. Travel time from Mission District to Financial District: 17 minutes. Latest departure from Mission District: 9:45PM - 90 minutes - 17 minutes = 7:58PM. But Amanda is also available in the evening, so we need to prioritize.\n4. **Amanda (Alamo Square)**: Available 7:45PM-9:00PM, minimum 60 minutes. Travel time from Mission District to Alamo Square: 11 minutes. Earliest arrival: 11:30AM + 11 minutes = 11:41AM, but Amanda is only available in the evening. So after Kevin, you have free time until evening. \n\nTo meet both Betty and Amanda:\n- After Kevin, go to Alamo Square (travel time: 11 minutes from Mission District). Arrive at Alamo Square by 11:41AM, but Amanda is only available in the evening. So you can wait or explore until evening.\n- Meet Amanda from 7:45PM-8:45PM (60 minutes).\n- Travel to Financial District (Alamo Square to Financial District: 17 minutes). Arrive by 9:02PM, but Betty's latest start time is 8:15PM (9:45PM - 90 minutes). So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternative:\n- After Kevin, go to Financial District (travel time: 17 minutes). Arrive by 11:47AM, but Betty is only available from 7:00PM. So you can wait until evening.\n- Meet Betty from 7:00PM-8:30PM (90 minutes).\n- Travel to Alamo Square (Financial District to Alamo Square: 17 minutes). Arrive by 8:47PM, but Amanda is only available until 9:00PM. You can meet Amanda from 8:47PM-9:00PM (13 minutes), which doesn't meet the 60-minute minimum.\n\nThus, the best schedule is to meet Helen, Kevin, and Betty, skipping Amanda.\n\nFinal schedule:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:09\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:24\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:24\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:42\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"person\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:47\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
