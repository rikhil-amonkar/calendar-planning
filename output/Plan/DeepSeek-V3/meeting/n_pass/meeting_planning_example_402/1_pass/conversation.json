Start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00AM.\n2. Travel to Marina District (16 minutes) to meet Matthew from 9:16AM to 9:31AM (15 minutes).\n3. Travel to Union Square (16 minutes) to meet Robert from 9:47AM to 10:02AM (15 minutes).\n4. Travel to Financial District (9 minutes) to meet Joseph from 10:11AM to 10:41AM (30 minutes). Note: Joseph is available from 2:15PM, but this is a placeholder. Adjusting to meet Joseph later.\n   - Actually, Joseph is only available from 2:15PM, so this won't work. Instead, after meeting Robert, we can explore other options.\n   - Revised: After meeting Robert at Union Square, travel to Haight-Ashbury (18 minutes) to meet Sarah later, but Sarah is only available from 5:00PM. This is not optimal.\n   - Better: After meeting Robert, travel to Sunset District (26 minutes) to meet Patricia later, but Patricia is only available from 5:00PM. Not optimal.\n   - Alternative: After meeting Robert, have free time until Joseph is available at 2:15PM.\n5. Meet Joseph at Financial District from 2:15PM to 2:45PM (30 minutes).\n6. Travel to Sunset District (31 minutes) to meet Patricia from 3:16PM to 4:01PM (45 minutes). But Patricia is only available from 5:00PM. Adjust to meet Patricia from 5:00PM to 5:45PM.\n7.
