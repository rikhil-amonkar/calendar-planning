    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible while respecting the constraints, we need to carefully plan the order of visits and travel times. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n1. Start at Mission District at 9:00AM.\n2. Meet Daniel at Nob Hill (8:15AM-11:00AM) for at least 15 minutes. Travel time: 12 minutes. Arrive at Nob Hill by 9:12AM, meet until 9:27AM.\n3. Travel to Pacific Heights (12:00PM-6:00PM) to meet Timothy. Travel time: 8 minutes. Arrive at Pacific Heights by 9:35AM, but Timothy isn't available until 12:00PM. This is too early, so we need to adjust.\n   \n   Instead, after meeting Daniel, we can go to Betty at Richmond District (1:15PM-3:45PM). Travel time from Nob Hill to Richmond District: 14 minutes. Arrive at Richmond District by 9:41AM, but Betty isn't available until 1:15PM. This is also too early.\n\n   Alternatively, after meeting Daniel, we can go to Kevin at Chinatown (12:00PM-7:00PM). Travel time from Nob Hill to Chinatown: 6 minutes. Arrive at Chinatown by 9:33AM, but Kevin isn't available until 12:00PM. Still too early.\n\n   The best option is to meet Daniel, then go to Pacific Heights to meet Timothy at 12:00PM. Travel time from Nob Hill to Pacific Heights: 8 minutes. Arrive at Pacific Heights by 9:35AM, wait until 12:00PM to meet Timothy. This is inefficient due to the long wait time.\n\n   A better approach is to meet Daniel first, then go to Betty at Richmond District at 1:15PM. Travel time from Nob Hill to Richmond District: 14 minutes. Arrive at Richmond District by 1:15PM, meet until 1:45PM.\n4. After meeting Betty, go to Kevin at Chinatown. Travel time: 20 minutes. Arrive at Chinatown by 2:05PM, meet until 2:35PM.\n5. After meeting Kevin, go to Timothy at Pacific Heights. Travel time: 10 minutes. Arrive at Pacific Heights by 2:45PM, meet until 4:15PM.\n6. After meeting Timothy, go to Steven at Marina District. Travel time: 6 minutes. Arrive at Marina District by 4:21PM, meet until 5:51PM.\n7. After meeting Steven, go to Lisa at The Castro. Travel time: 21 minutes. Arrive at The Castro by 6:12PM, but Lisa isn't available until 7:15PM. This is too early.\n   \n   Instead, after meeting Steven, we can go to Ashley at Golden Gate Park (8:45PM-9:45PM). Travel time: 18 minutes. Arrive at Golden Gate Park by 6:09PM, but Ashley isn't available until 8:45PM. Too early.\n\n   Alternatively, after meeting Steven, we can go to Elizabeth at Presidio (9:15PM-10:15PM). Travel time: 10 minutes. Arrive at Presidio by 6:01PM, but Elizabeth isn't available until 9:15PM. Too early.\n\n   The best option is to meet Steven until 5:51PM, then go to The Castro to meet Lisa at 7:15PM. Travel time: 21 minutes. Arrive at The Castro by 6:12PM, wait until 7:15PM to meet Lisa until 9:15PM (120 minutes).\n8. After meeting Lisa, go to Elizabeth at Presidio. Travel time: 20 minutes. Arrive at Presidio by 9:35PM, meet until 10:20PM (45 minutes).\n9. After meeting Elizabeth, go to Ashley at Golden Gate Park. Travel time: 12 minutes. Arrive at Golden Gate Park by 10:32PM, but Ashley's availability ends at 9:45PM. Cannot meet Ashley.\n\nFinal schedule:\n- Meet Daniel at Nob Hill from 9:12AM to 9:27AM.\n- Meet Betty at Richmond District from 1:15PM to 1:45PM.\n- Meet Kevin at Chinatown from 2:05PM to 2:35PM.\n- Meet Timothy at Pacific Heights from 2:45PM to 4:15PM.\n- Meet Steven at Marina District from 4:21PM to 5:51PM.\n- Meet Lisa at The Castro from 7:15PM to 9:15PM.\n- Meet Elizabeth at Presidio from 9:35PM to 10:20PM.\n\nJSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Daniel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:12\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:27\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:05\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:35\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Timothy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Steven\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:21\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:51\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Lisa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Elizabeth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:35\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:20\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
