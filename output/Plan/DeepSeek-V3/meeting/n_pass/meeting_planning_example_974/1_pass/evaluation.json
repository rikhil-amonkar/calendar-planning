    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible while respecting the constraints, we need to carefully plan the order of visits, considering travel times and overlapping availability. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"William\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:50\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:50\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Charles\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:55\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:25\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Jeffrey (Richmond District)**: Start at 12:00 PM (earliest availability) and meet for 45 minutes.

The chosen schedule maximizes the number of friends met while fulfilling all minimum time requirements.\n- Travel times are accounted for between meetings, and all meetings are scheduled within the friends' availability windows.",
