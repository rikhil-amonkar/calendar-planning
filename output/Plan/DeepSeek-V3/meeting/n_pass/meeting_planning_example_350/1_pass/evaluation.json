    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible within the given constraints, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM**.\n2. **Betty** is available earliest (until 5:15 PM) and requires the longest meeting time (90 minutes). We should prioritize meeting her first.\n3. **Mary** is available from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM and requires 45 minutes.\n4. **Charles** is available from 11:15 AM to 3:00 PM and requires 120 minutes.\n5. **Lisa** is available from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM and requires 75 minutes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Schedule:\n1. **From Bayview to Haight-Ashbury (Betty)**:\n   - Travel time: 19 minutes.\n   - Arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 9:19 AM.\n   - Meet Betty from 9:19 AM to 10:49 AM (90 minutes).\n\n2. **From Haight-Ashbury to Pacific Heights (Mary)**:\n   - Travel time: 12 minutes.\n   - Arrive at Pacific Heights at 11:01 AM.\n   - Meet Mary from 11:01 AM to 11:46 AM (45 minutes).\n\n3. **From Pacific Heights to Financial District (Charles)**:\n   - Travel time: 13 minutes.\n   - Arrive at Financial District at 11:59 AM.\n   - Meet Charles from 11:59 AM to 1:59 PM (120 minutes).\n\n4. **From Financial District to Mission District (Lisa)**:\n   - Travel time: 17 minutes.\n   - Arrive at Mission District at 2:16 PM.\n   - However, Lisa is only available from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM, so this meeting is not possible within the same day. \n\nGiven the constraints, the earliest we can meet Lisa is at 8:30 PM, but we cannot fit the 75-minute meeting and the travel time from Financial District to Mission District (17 minutes) within her availability window (8:30 PM to 10:00 PM). Therefore, we cannot meet Lisa on the same day.\n\n### Final Schedule (excluding Lisa):\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Betty\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:19\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:49\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:01\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:46\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Charles\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:59\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:59\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We meet Betty first because her window closes earliest (5:15 PM) and she requires the longest meeting time.\n- After meeting Betty, we travel to Mary, who has a flexible window (10:00 AM to 7:00 PM) and a shorter meeting time.\n- Finally, we meet Charles, whose window is tight (11:15 AM to 3:00 PM) but fits after meeting Mary.\n- Lisa cannot be met on the same day due to her late availability and the travel time constraints. \n\nThus, the optimal schedule allows us to meet Betty, Mary, and Charles.",
