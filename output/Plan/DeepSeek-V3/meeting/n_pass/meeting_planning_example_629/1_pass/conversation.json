Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n1. Start at Russian Hill at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet Margaret in Chinatown first (closest, 9 minutes travel).\n3. Meet Kimberly in Golden Gate Park (longest required meeting time, 120 minutes).\n4. Meet Kenneth in Bayview (60 minutes).\n5. Meet Nancy in Pacific Heights (15 minutes).\n6.

This could be used for rest or additional activities. Also, the travel time from Presidio to Richmond District is short (7 minutes), so the arrival is at 16:56, but Helen's availability starts at 19:45. This gap is unavoidable given the constraints. \n\nAll meeting duration and travel time constraints are satisfied in this schedule."
