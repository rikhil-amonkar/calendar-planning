    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: \n\nTo optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible within the given constraints, we need to carefully plan the order of meetings and travel times. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n1. Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet John at Pacific Heights (15 minutes minimum). Travel time from Nob Hill to Pacific Heights is 8 minutes.\n3. Meet Jeffrey at Presidio (105 minutes minimum). Travel time from Pacific Heights to Presidio is 11 minutes. Jeffrey is only available until 10:00 AM, so this is not feasible. Instead, we must go directly to Presidio from Nob Hill to meet Jeffrey.\n4. After meeting Jeffrey, travel to Pacific Heights to meet John (if time permits).\n5. Then, travel to North Beach to meet Steven (45 minutes minimum).\n6. Finally, travel to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Barbara (30 minutes minimum).\n\nGiven the constraints, here's the feasible schedule:\n\n- Arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Presidio (17 minutes), arrive at 9:17 AM.\n- Meet Jeffrey from 9:17 AM to 11:02 AM (105 minutes).\n- Travel to Pacific Heights (11 minutes), arrive at 11:13 AM.\n- Meet John from 11:13 AM to 11:28 AM (15 minutes).\n- Travel to North Beach (9 minutes), arrive at 11:37 AM.\n- Meet Steven from 1:30 PM to 2:15 PM (45 minutes).\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (6 minutes), arrive at 2:21 PM.\n- Meet Barbara from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM (30 minutes).\n\nHowever, this schedule leaves a large gap between 2:21 PM and 6:00 PM, which is not optimal. Let's try to adjust:\n\nAlternative schedule:\n- Arrive at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n- Travel to Presidio (17 minutes), arrive at 9:17 AM.\n- Meet Jeffrey from 9:17 AM to 11:02 AM (105 minutes).\n- Travel to Pacific Heights (11 minutes), arrive at 11:13 AM.\n- Meet John from 11:13 AM to 11:28 AM (15 minutes).\n- Travel to North Beach (9 minutes), arrive at 11:37 AM.\n- Meet Steven from 11:37 AM to 12:22 PM (45 minutes).\n- Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (6 minutes), arrive at 12:28 PM.\n- Meet Barbara from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM (30 minutes).\n\nThis still leaves a gap from 12:28 PM to 6:00 PM. It seems impossible to meet all friends without gaps due to Barbara's availability starting at 6:00 PM. \n\nFinal optimized schedule (meeting all constraints):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:17\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:02\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"John\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:13\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:28\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Steven\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
