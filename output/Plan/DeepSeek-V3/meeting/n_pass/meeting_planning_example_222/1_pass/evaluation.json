    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize the schedule and meet all friends for the minimum required time, we can follow this itinerary:\n\n1. Start at Nob Hill at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to North Beach (8 minutes) to meet Helen from 9:08 AM to 11:08 AM (120 minutes).\n3. Travel back to Nob Hill (7 minutes) to reset the starting point, arriving at 11:15 AM.\n4. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf (11 minutes) to meet Kimberly from 11:26 AM to 12:11 PM (45 minutes).\n5. Travel back to Nob Hill (11 minutes), arriving at 12:22 PM.\n6. Travel to Bayview (19 minutes) to meet Patricia from 12:41 PM to 2:41 PM (120 minutes).\n\nThis schedule ensures all meetings meet the minimum duration requirements and accounts for travel time. Here is the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:08\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:08\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:26\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:11\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Patricia\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:41\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:41\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The schedule assumes that the friends are available during the adjusted times (e.g., Kimberly is willing to meet earlier than her stated availability). If strict adherence to their availability windows is required, the schedule would need to be adjusted, potentially making it impossible to meet all friends for the minimum durations in a single day. For example, Patricia's availability starts at 6:00 PM, which would conflict with Kimberly's meeting time if strict adherence is enforced. In that case, you might have to drop one of the meetings or reduce the duration. \n\nIf strict adherence is required, an alternative schedule might be:\n- Meet Helen from 9:08 AM to 11:08 AM.\n- Meet Kimberly from 4:30 PM to 5:15 PM.\n- Meet Patricia from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM.\n\nThis would require waiting between meetings, but it respects the friends' availability windows. Here's the JSON for the strict schedule:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:08\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:08\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Patricia\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
