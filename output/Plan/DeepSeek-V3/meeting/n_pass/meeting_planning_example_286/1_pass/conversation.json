        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to schedule meetings with Rebecca, Karen, and Carol while respecting the travel times between locations and the time constraints of each friend's availability. The goal is to meet all friends for the minimum required time while optimizing the schedule to maximize the number of meetings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Initial Location and Time**: Start at Union Square at 9:00 AM.\n2. **Carol's Availability**: \n   - Location: Sunset District\n   - Available: 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM\n   - Minimum meeting time: 30 minutes\n   - Travel time from Union Square to Sunset District: 26 minutes\n   - Earliest arrival at Sunset District: 9:00 AM + 26 minutes = 9:26 AM\n   - Can meet Carol anytime between 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM. Let's meet her from 10:15 AM - 10:45 AM (30 minutes).\n   - Depart Sunset District at 10:45 AM.\n\n3. **Travel to Mission District to meet Rebecca**:\n   - Travel time from Sunset District to Mission District: 24 minutes\n   - Arrival at Mission District: 10:45 AM + 24 minutes = 11:09 AM\n   - Rebecca is available from 11:30 AM - 8:15 PM. Earliest meeting start is 11:30 AM.\n   - Wait until 11:30 AM, then meet Rebecca for 120 minutes (until 1:30 PM).\n   - Depart Mission District at 1:30 PM.\n\n4. **Travel to Bayview to meet Karen**:\n   - Travel time from Mission District to Bayview: 15 minutes\n   - Arrival at Bayview: 1:30 PM + 15 minutes = 1:45 PM\n   - Karen is available from 12:45 PM - 3:00 PM. Latest meeting end is 3:00 PM.\n   - Can meet Karen from 1:45 PM - 3:00 PM (75 minutes), but the minimum required is 120 minutes. This doesn't work.\n   - Alternative: Leave Rebecca earlier to meet Karen for 120 minutes.\n     - Meet Rebecca from 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM (90 minutes), but this is less than the required 120 minutes.\n     - This doesn't work either.\n   - Another approach: Skip Carol and meet Rebecca and Karen.\n     - From Union Square, go to Bayview to meet Karen first, then Mission District to meet Rebecca.\n     - But Karen is only available from 12:45 PM - 3:00 PM, and Rebecca is available from 11:30 AM - 8:15 PM.\n     - This might not work because meeting Karen first would require arriving at Bayview by 12:45 PM, which is possible, but then meeting Rebecca afterward would be tight.\n\n5. **Optimal Schedule**:\n   - Meet Carol from 10:15 AM - 10:45 AM (Sunset District).\n   - Travel to Mission District (24 minutes), arrive at 11:09 AM, wait until 11:30 AM, meet Rebecca until 1:30 PM.\n   - Travel to Bayview (15 minutes), arrive at 1:45 PM, meet Karen until 3:00 PM (only 75 minutes, which doesn't meet the 120-minute requirement).\n   - Since meeting Karen for 120 minutes isn't possible in this schedule, we must prioritize Rebecca and Carol.\n   - Final schedule: Meet Carol and Rebecca, skip Karen.\n\n### Final Answer:\nSince it's impossible to meet all three friends for the required minimum times, the best schedule is to meet Carol and Rebecca.\n\n```json\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Rebecca\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
