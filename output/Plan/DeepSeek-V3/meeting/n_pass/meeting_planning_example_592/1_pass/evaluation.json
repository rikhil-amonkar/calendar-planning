    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: \n\nTo optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible while satisfying the minimum meeting durations, we need to consider the travel times and the availability windows of each friend. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n1. Start at North Beach at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet Jeffrey at Union Square first, as he is available from 9:30 AM and requires a long meeting (120 minutes). Travel time from North Beach to Union Square is 7 minutes, so arrive at 9:07 AM. Start meeting at 9:30 AM (when Jeffrey is available) until 11:30 AM.\n3. Next, meet Mark at Golden Gate Park. Travel time from Union Square to Golden Gate Park is 22 minutes, so arrive at 11:52 AM. Mark is available until 5:45 PM, so meet from 11:52 AM to 12:07 PM (15 minutes minimum).\n4. Next, meet Robert at Chinatown. Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Chinatown is 23 minutes, so arrive at 12:30 PM. Robert is available until 4:45 PM, so meet from 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM (90 minutes minimum).\n5. Next, meet Sandra at Nob Hill. Travel time from Chinatown to Nob Hill is 8 minutes, so arrive at 2:08 PM. Sandra is available until 3:30 PM, so meet from 2:08 PM to 2:23 PM (15 minutes minimum).\n6. Next, meet Carol at Mission District. Travel time from Nob Hill to Mission District is 13 minutes, so arrive at 2:36 PM. Carol is not available until 6:15 PM, so this is not possible. Instead, we can adjust the schedule to meet Carol later.\n7. After meeting Sandra, we can wait until Carol is available. The next available friend is James at Pacific Heights from 8:00 PM. Travel time from Nob Hill to Pacific Heights is 8 minutes, so arrive at 2:31 PM. But James is not available until 8:00 PM, so this doesn't work. Instead, we can meet Carol at Mission District from 6:15 PM. Travel time from Nob Hill to Mission District is 13 minutes, so leave Nob Hill at 6:02 PM to arrive at 6:15 PM. Meet Carol from 6:15 PM to 6:30 PM (15 minutes minimum).\n8. Finally, meet James at Pacific Heights. Travel time from Mission District to Pacific Heights is 16 minutes, so leave Mission District at 7:44 PM to arrive at 8:00 PM. Meet James from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM (120 minutes minimum).\n\nHere is the schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:52\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:07\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Robert\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:08\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:23\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"James\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule meets all friends while satisfying the minimum meeting durations and travel constraints.",
