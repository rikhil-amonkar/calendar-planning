The minimum meeting durations desired.\n4. The starting point (Nob Hill at 9:00 AM).\n\nHere\u2019s the optimized schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"Chinatown\",\n      \"to\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:37\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sarah\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:37\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:07\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"Union Square\",\n      \"to\": \"The Castro\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:07\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:24\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:24\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:54\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"The Castro\",\n      \"to\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:54\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:12\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:12\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:12\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"Russian Hill\",\n      \"to\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:12\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:19\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Daniel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:19\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:34\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"Pacific Heights\",\n      \"to\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:34\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:50\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:50\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:50\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"Golden Gate Park\",\n      \"to\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:50\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:13\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Thomas\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:13\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:28\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"North Beach\",\n      \"to\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:28\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:33\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"from\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"to\": \"Haight-Ashbury\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:35\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:35\",\n      \"end_time\": \"23:35\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Richard (Chinatown)**: Start at 9:00 AM (right after arrival at Nob Hill, since Chinatown is close to Nob Hill).\n2. **Sarah (Union Square)**: Travel to Union Square after meeting Richard. Meet Sarah for 90 minutes.\n3. **Kenneth (The Castro)**: Travel to The Castro after meeting Sarah. Meet Kenneth for 30 minutes.\n4. **Karen (Russian Hill)**: Travel to Russian Hill after meeting Kenneth. Meet Karen for 120 minutes.\n5. **Daniel (Pacific Heights)**: Travel to Pacific Heights after meeting Karen. Meet Daniel for 15 minutes.\n6. **Mark (Golden Gate Park)**: Travel to Golden Gate Park after meeting Daniel. Meet Mark for 120 minutes.\n7. **Thomas (North Beach)**: Travel to North Beach after meeting Mark. Meet Thomas for 15 minutes.\n8. **Mary (Embarcadero)**: Travel to Embarcadero after meeting Thomas. Meet Mary from 8:00 PM to 9:15 PM (75 minutes).\n9. **Joseph (Haight-Ashbury)**: Travel to Haight-Ashbury after meeting Mary. Meet Joseph from 9:35 PM to 11:35 PM (120 minutes).\n\n### Notes:\n- The schedule maximizes the number of friends met while respecting all constraints.\n- Travel times are accounted for between meetings.\n- Some friends (like David at Marina District) could not be included without violating other constraints (e.g., overlapping with Mary or Joseph).\n- The schedule assumes no delays and exact travel times. Adjustments may be needed in practice."
