    "execution_output": "To solve this problem, we need to create a schedule that allows us to meet both Carol and Jessica for the minimum required durations while considering the travel times between districts. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at Richmond District at 9:00 AM.\n2. **Carol's Availability**: Carol is at Marina District from 11:30 AM to 3:00 PM. We need to meet her for at least 60 minutes.\n3. **Jessica's Availability**: Jessica is at Pacific Heights from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM. We need to meet her for at least 45 minutes.\n4. **Travel Times**:\n   - Richmond District to Marina District: 9 minutes.\n   - Marina District to Pacific Heights: 7 minutes.\n   - Pacific Heights to Richmond District: 12 minutes (not needed here since we're not returning).\n\n### Possible Schedule:\n- **Travel to Marina District**: Leave Richmond at 11:21 AM to arrive at Marina by 11:30 AM (9 minutes travel).\n- **Meet Carol**: From 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM (60 minutes).\n- **Travel to Pacific Heights**: Leave Marina at 3:23 PM to arrive at Pacific Heights by 3:30 PM (7 minutes travel).\n- **Meet Jessica**: From 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM (45 minutes).\n\nThis schedule meets all constraints:\n- Carol is met for 60 minutes within her availability.\n- Jessica is met for 45 minutes within her availability.\n- Travel times are accounted for.\n\n### Final Schedule in JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Carol\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"15:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSOLUTION:\n```json\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Carol\", \"start_time\": \"11:30\", \"end_time\": \"12:30\"}, {\"action\": \"meet\", \"person\": \"Jessica\", \"start_time\": \"15:30\", \"end_time\": \"16:15\"}]}\n```",
