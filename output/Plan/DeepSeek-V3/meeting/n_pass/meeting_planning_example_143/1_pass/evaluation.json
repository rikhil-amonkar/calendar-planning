    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the schedule to meet both Karen and Mark for the required minimum durations, we need to consider the travel times and the available time slots for each friend. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n1. Start at North Beach at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Embarcadero to meet Mark. The travel time is 6 minutes, so arrive at Embarcadero by 9:06 AM. However, Mark is only available from 1:00 PM to 5:45 PM, so we cannot meet him earlier. Instead, we can stay at North Beach or explore until it's time to travel to Embarcadero to meet Mark.\n3. Leave North Beach at 12:54 PM to arrive at Embarcadero by 1:00 PM (6-minute travel time).\n4. Meet Mark from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM (120 minutes, the minimum required).\n5. Leave Embarcadero at 3:00 PM to travel to Pacific Heights to meet Karen. The travel time is 11 minutes, so arrive at Pacific Heights by 3:11 PM. However, Karen is only available from 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM, so we cannot meet her earlier. Instead, we can stay at Embarcadero or explore until it's time to travel to Pacific Heights to meet Karen.\n6. Leave Embarcadero at 6:34 PM to arrive at Pacific Heights by 6:45 PM (11-minute travel time).\n7. Meet Karen from 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM (90 minutes, the minimum required).\n\nHere is the schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"15:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule ensures that you meet both friends for the minimum required durations while accounting for travel times.",
