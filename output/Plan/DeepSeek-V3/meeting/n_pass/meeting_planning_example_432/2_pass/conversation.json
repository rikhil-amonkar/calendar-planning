Otherwise, the maximum achievable is **4/5 friends**.  \n\n---\n**Final Answer (Best Possible Under Constraints):**\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:02\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:17\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:27\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:57\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"note\": \"Cannot meet David; problem is unsolvable for 5 people.\"\n}\n```"
