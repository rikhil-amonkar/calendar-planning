    "execution_output": "After carefully re-evaluating the constraints, I realize that meeting David is impossible given the arrival time at Golden Gate Park (9:00 AM) and his availability (until 9:00 AM at Embarcadero, which takes 25 minutes to reach). Since the problem requires meeting exactly 5 people, but one is unmeetable, I must conclude that this is an unsolvable scheduling problem as currently defined.\n\nHowever, if we interpret the constraints slightly differently - perhaps assuming David could be met at Embarcadero exactly at 9:00 AM (arriving precisely when he leaves) - here's the only possible schedule that attempts to meet all 5 friends:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Embarcadero\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"9:25\",\n      \"note\": \"Arrive exactly as David leaves - cannot actually meet\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Mission District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"9:25\",\n      \"end_time\": \"9:42\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Financial District\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:02\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:02\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:17\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Fisherman's Wharf\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:17\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:27\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:27\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:57\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"travel\",\n      \"destination\": \"Bayview\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:57\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:23\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"note\": \"Cannot truly meet David; problem remains unsolvable for 5 people given current constraints. This schedule shows the attempt but fails the 5-person requirement.\"\n}\n```\n\nKey Issues:\n1. David cannot actually be met (arrival at 9:25 AM vs his 9:00 AM departure)\n2. All other friends are successfully met with required minimum durations\n3. The \"must meet 5 people\" constraint cannot be satisfied\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Adjust David's availability window to start at 9:30 AM or later\n2. Or relax the \"must meet exactly 5\" requirement to \"meet as many as possible\"\n3. Or allow the meeting with David to be just a brief hello at 9:00 AM (though this violates the 30-minute minimum)\n\nWithout these adjustments, the problem has no valid solution that meets all stated constraints. The maximum achievable is meeting 4 out of 5 friends.",
