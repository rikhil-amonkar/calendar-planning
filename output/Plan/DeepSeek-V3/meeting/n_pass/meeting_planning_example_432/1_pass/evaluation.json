    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible within the given constraints, we need to carefully plan the order of meetings and travel times. Here's the optimal itinerary:\n\n1. Start at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet David at Embarcadero (earliest possible meeting, but David is only available until 9:00 AM, and we arrive at Golden Gate Park at 9:00 AM. Travel time to Embarcadero is 25 minutes, so we cannot meet David).\n3. Next, meet Barbara at Financial District (available from 10:30 AM to 4:30 PM). Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Financial District is 26 minutes, so we can arrive by 9:26 AM but must wait until 10:30 AM to meet Barbara. However, this is inefficient.\n4. Alternatively, meet Kevin at Mission District (available from 11:15 AM to 3:15 PM). Travel time from Golden Gate Park to Mission District is 17 minutes, so we can arrive by 9:17 AM and wait until 11:15 AM to meet Kevin for 30 minutes (until 11:45 AM).\n5. Then, travel to Financial District to meet Barbara. Travel time from Mission District to Financial District is 17 minutes, so we can arrive by 12:02 PM and meet Barbara until 4:30 PM (but we only need 15 minutes).\n6. Then, travel to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Joseph. Travel time from Financial District to Fisherman's Wharf is 10 minutes, so we can arrive by 4:40 PM and meet Joseph until 5:30 PM (50 minutes, but we need 90 minutes, so this doesn't work).\n7. Alternatively, after meeting Barbara for 15 minutes (until 12:17 PM), travel to Fisherman's Wharf (10 minutes, arrive by 12:27 PM) and meet Joseph until 2:57 PM (90 minutes). Then, travel to Bayview to meet Jeffrey. Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Bayview is 26 minutes, so arrive by 3:23 PM, but Jeffrey is only available from 5:30 PM, so we must wait until then and meet until 6:30 PM (60 minutes).\n\nHere's the final optimized schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:02\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:17\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:27\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:57\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jeffrey\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule meets all friends except David (due to time constraints) and satisfies all minimum meeting duration requirements.",
