Since Fisherman's Wharf is only 10 minutes away, you can meet Mark from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM (30 minutes). This fits within his availability (8:15 AM - 10:00 AM).\n\n2. **Ashley (Richmond District)**: After meeting Mark, you travel to the Richmond District (21 minutes from Financial District). You arrive by 9:51 AM, but Ashley is available from 9:45 AM, so you meet her from 9:45 AM to 10:30 AM (45 minutes).\n\n3. **Joseph (Marina District)**: Next, you travel to the Marina District (11 minutes from Richmond District). You arrive by 10:41 AM, but Joseph is available from 10:45 AM, so you meet him from 10:45 AM to 12:15 PM (90 minutes).\n\n4. **Stephanie (Presidio)**: From the Marina District, you travel to the Presidio (10 minutes). You arrive by 12:25 PM, but Stephanie is available from 12:15 PM, so you meet her from 12:15 PM to 1:30 PM (75 minutes).\n\n5. **Lisa (Haight-Ashbury)**: After Stephanie, you have free time until Lisa's availability at 3:30 PM. You travel to Haight-Ashbury (15 minutes from Presidio) and meet her from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM (45 minutes).\n\n6. **Patricia (Union Square)**: From Haight-Ashbury, you travel to Union Square (19 minutes). You arrive by 4:34 PM, but Patricia is available from 4:30 PM, so you meet her from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM (120 minutes).\n\n7. **William (Russian Hill)**: Finally, you travel to Russian Hill (13 minutes from Union Square). You arrive by 6:43 PM, but William is available from 6:45 PM, so you meet him from 6:45 PM to 7:45 PM (60 minutes).\n\n### Notes:\n- **Betty (Bayview)**: Could not be included without sacrificing other meetings due to time constraints.\n- **Brian (The Castro)**: Could not be included without overlapping with other meetings.\n- **Karen (Sunset District)**: Could not be included due to the long meeting time (105 minutes) conflicting with other priorities.\n\nThis schedule maximizes the number of friends met while respecting travel times and meeting duration constraints.",
