    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible, we need to consider the travel times and the constraints provided. Here's the best possible itinerary:\n\n1. **Kevin**: Since you arrive at Presidio at 9:00 AM and Kevin is only available until 8:45 AM, it's impossible to meet Kevin given the current constraints. Therefore, Kevin cannot be included in the itinerary.\n\n2. **Helen**: You can meet Helen at North Beach from 11:00 AM to 12:15 PM (45 minutes minimum is satisfied).\n\n3. **Barbara**: You can meet Barbara at Alamo Square from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM (120 minutes minimum is satisfied). Travel time from North Beach to Alamo Square is 16 minutes, so you'd need to leave North Beach by 4:44 PM to arrive at Alamo Square by 5:00 PM.\n\n4. **Mary**: You can meet Mary at Nob Hill from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM (45 minutes minimum is satisfied). However, this overlaps with Barbara's meeting. Since Barbara's meeting is longer and has a higher minimum time requirement, it's better to prioritize Barbara and skip Mary.\n\n5. **Emily**: You can meet Emily at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:15 PM to 7:00 PM (30 minutes minimum is satisfied). However, this conflicts with Barbara's meeting. Since Barbara's meeting is longer and has a higher priority, it's better to skip Emily.\n\n6. **Mark**: You can meet Mark at Marina District from 6:15 PM to 7:45 PM (75 minutes minimum is satisfied). Travel time from Alamo Square to Marina District is 15 minutes, so you'd need to leave Alamo Square by 6:00 PM to arrive at Marina District by 6:15 PM. This would mean leaving Barbara's meeting early at 6:00 PM (only meeting her for 60 minutes instead of 120), which doesn't satisfy her minimum time requirement. Therefore, it's better to skip Mark.\n\n7. **Laura**: You can meet Laura at Sunset District from 7:00 PM to 9:15 PM (75 minutes minimum is satisfied). Travel time from Alamo Square to Sunset District is 16 minutes, so you'd need to leave Alamo Square by 6:44 PM to arrive at Sunset District by 7:00 PM. This would mean leaving Barbara's meeting early at 6:44 PM (only meeting her for 104 minutes instead of 120), which doesn't satisfy her minimum time requirement. Therefore, it's better to skip Laura.\n\n8. **Michelle**: You can meet Michelle at Golden Gate Park from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM (15 minutes minimum is satisfied). Travel time from Alamo Square to Golden Gate Park is 9 minutes, so you'd need to leave Alamo Square by 7:51 PM to arrive at Golden Gate Park by 8:00 PM. This would mean leaving Barbara's meeting early at 7:00 PM (meeting her for 120 minutes), which satisfies her minimum time requirement. Then you can meet Michelle from 8:00 PM to 8:15 PM.\n\nGiven these constraints, the best possible itinerary is to meet Helen, Barbara, and Michelle.
