    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\n\nAfter carefully re-evaluating the constraints, I realize that meeting all 8 friends is impossible because Kevin's availability (7:15AM-8:45AM) completely precedes your arrival time (9:00AM). This makes the \"must meet exactly 8 people\" constraint fundamentally unsatisfiable given the current parameters.\n\nHowever, if we assume there might be a typo in Kevin's availability (perhaps it should be PM instead of AM), here's what the schedule could look like to meet all 8 friends:\n\n### Revised Itinerary (Assuming Kevin's availability is actually 7:15PM-8:45PM):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Helen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Emily\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mary\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Barbara\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Mark\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"23:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"23:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"00:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Michelle\",\n      \"start_time\": \"01:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"01:15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Key Notes:\n1. This schedule assumes:\n   - Kevin's availability is actually 7:15PM-8:45PM (not AM)\n   - All meetings can extend late into the night\n   - Some meetings are shortened from their minimum requirements to fit everyone\n\n2. Fundamental Issues:\n   - The original constraint with Kevin's AM availability makes meeting all 8 impossible\n   - Even with PM availability, this schedule requires:\n     - Cutting Barbara's meeting short (120min \u2192 90min)\n     - Meeting very late at night (until 1:15AM)\n     - Not meeting some friends for their full minimum duration\n\n3. Recommended Actions:\n   - Verify Kevin's availability time (likely should be PM)\n   - Consider relaxing some minimum duration requirements\n   - Allow meetings to extend later into the evening\n\nWithout adjusting Kevin's availability time, it's mathematically impossible to meet all 8 friends given the current constraints. The only feasible solution is to meet 7 friends as shown in previous responses, or to adjust Kevin's availability to a time after 9:00AM.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Provide the optimal 7-friend solution again, or\n2. Suggest how to adjust constraints to make an 8-friend solution possible?",
