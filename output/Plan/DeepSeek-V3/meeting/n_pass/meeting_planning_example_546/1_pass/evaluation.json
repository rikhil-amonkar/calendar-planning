    "execution_output": "SOLUTION: To optimize meeting as many friends as possible within the given constraints, we need to carefully schedule the meetings considering travel times and availability. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n1. Start at Embarcadero at 9:00AM.\n2. Meet Lisa at Union Square (10 min travel, 9:10AM arrival). Meet for 45 minutes until 9:55AM.\n3. Travel to Pacific Heights (15 min travel, 10:10AM arrival). Meet Nancy for 90 minutes until 11:40AM.\n4. Travel to Nob Hill (8 min travel, 11:48AM arrival). Meet Andrew for 60 minutes until 12:48PM.\n5. Travel to Financial District (9 min travel, 12:57PM arrival). Meet Joshua for 15 minutes until 1:12PM.\n6. Travel back to Nob Hill (9 min travel, 1:21PM arrival). Meet Andrew again for the remaining time if needed or explore other options.\n7. Travel to Bayview (19 min travel, 1:40PM arrival). Meet John for 75 minutes until 2:55PM.\n8. Travel to Richmond District (25 min travel, 3:20PM arrival). Meet Kenneth for 30 minutes until 3:50PM.\n\nHowever, this initial schedule doesn't fully account for all constraints (e.g., Kenneth is only available from 9:15PM to 10:00PM, not earlier). Let me adjust the schedule to fit all constraints properly.\n\nHere's the corrected optimal schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Lisa\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:10\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:55\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:10\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:40\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Andrew\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:48\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:48\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joshua\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:57\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:12\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"John\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"18:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kenneth\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Start by meeting Lisa at Union Square right after arrival (9:10AM-9:55AM).\n- Travel to Pacific Heights to meet Nancy (10:10AM-11:40AM).\n- Travel to Nob Hill to meet Andrew (11:48AM-12:48PM).\n- Travel to Financial District to meet Joshua (12:57PM-1:12PM).\n- Afternoon is free until John becomes available at Bayview at 4:45PM (meet until 6:00PM).\n- Finally, meet Kenneth at Richmond District from 9:15PM to 9:45PM.\n\nThis schedule meets all minimum time requirements and fits within everyone's availability.",
