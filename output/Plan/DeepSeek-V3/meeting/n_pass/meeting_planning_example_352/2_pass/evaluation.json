    "execution_output": "To meet all four friends (Karen, Joseph, Sandra, and Nancy) within the given constraints, we need to optimize the schedule carefully. Here\u2019s the revised plan:\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n1. **Karen's Meeting (Nob Hill, 9:15 PM - 9:45 PM)**:\n   - Since Karen is only available late in the day, we must ensure the other meetings are scheduled earlier to allow time to reach Nob Hill by 9:15 PM.\n   - Travel from any location to Nob Hill must complete by 9:15 PM.\n\n2. **Joseph's Meeting (Haight-Ashbury, 12:30 PM - 7:45 PM)**:\n   - Requires 90 minutes, so we must schedule this meeting early enough to leave time for travel to Nob Hill afterward.\n   - Travel from Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill takes 15 minutes, so the latest we can leave Haight-Ashbury is 9:00 PM to arrive by 9:15 PM.\n\n3. **Nancy's Meeting (Marina District, 11:00 AM - 8:15 PM)**:\n   - Requires 105 minutes (1 hour 45 minutes). We must schedule this meeting early enough to leave time for Joseph's meeting and travel.\n\n4. **Sandra's Meeting (Chinatown, 7:15 AM - 7:15 PM)**:\n   - Requires 75 minutes. Since we start at Union Square at 9:00 AM, we can meet Sandra first (travel to Chinatown: 7 minutes).\n\n### Revised Schedule:\n1. **Meet Sandra (Chinatown)**:\n   - Start: 9:07 AM (arrive at Chinatown at 9:07 AM after 7-minute travel from Union Square).\n   - End: 10:22 AM (75 minutes).\n\n2. **Travel to Marina District (12 minutes)**:\n   - Depart Chinatown at 10:22 AM, arrive at Marina District at 10:34 AM.\n   - Wait until 11:00 AM (Nancy's availability starts).\n\n3. **Meet Nancy (Marina District)**:\n   - Start: 11:00 AM.\n   - End: 12:45 PM (105 minutes).\n\n4. **Travel to Haight-Ashbury (16 minutes)**:\n   - Depart Marina District at 12:45 PM, arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 1:01 PM.\n\n5. **Meet Joseph (Haight-Ashbury)**:\n   - Start: 1:01 PM.\n   - End: 2:31 PM (90 minutes).\n\n6. **Travel to Nob Hill (15 minutes)**:\n   - Depart Haight-Ashbury at 2:31 PM, arrive at Nob Hill at 2:46 PM.\n   - Wait until 9:15 PM (Karen's availability starts).\n\n7. **Meet Karen (Nob Hill)**:\n   - Start: 9:15 PM.\n   - End: 9:45 PM (30 minutes).\n\n### Final Solution:\nThis schedule meets all four friends while respecting travel times and minimum meeting durations. Here\u2019s the JSON output:\n\n```json\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:07\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:22\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:01\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:31\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Karen\",\n      \"start_time\": \"21:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"21:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- The long wait at Nob Hill (from 2:46 PM to 9:15 PM) is unavoidable due to Karen's late availability. If possible, you could use this time for other activities (e.g., exploring Nob Hill).\n- All travel times and meeting durations are strictly adhered to. No constraints are violated.",
