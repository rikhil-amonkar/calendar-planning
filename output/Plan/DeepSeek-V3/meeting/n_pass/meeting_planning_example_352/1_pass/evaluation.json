    "execution_output": "To solve this problem, we need to create a schedule that allows us to meet all four friends (Karen, Joseph, Sandra, and Nancy) for the minimum required time while considering travel times between locations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Location**: You start at Union Square at 9:00 AM.\n2. **Meeting Priorities**:\n   - Sandra is available the earliest (7:15 AM - 7:15 PM) and requires 75 minutes. The earliest you can meet her is at 9:00 AM (after arriving at Union Square, travel to Chinatown takes 7 minutes). So, you can meet Sandra from 9:07 AM to 10:22 AM.\n   - Nancy is available from 11:00 AM - 8:15 PM and requires 105 minutes (1 hour 45 minutes). After meeting Sandra, you can travel from Chinatown to Marina District (12 minutes), arriving at 10:34 AM. However, Nancy is only available at 11:00 AM, so you can meet her from 11:00 AM to 12:45 PM.\n   - Joseph is available from 12:30 PM - 7:45 PM and requires 90 minutes. After meeting Nancy, you can travel from Marina District to Haight-Ashbury (16 minutes), arriving at 1:01 PM. You can meet Joseph from 1:01 PM to 2:31 PM.\n   - Karen is available from 9:15 PM - 9:45 PM and requires 30 minutes. After meeting Joseph, you can travel from Haight-Ashbury to Nob Hill (15 minutes), arriving at 2:46 PM. However, Karen is only available at 9:15 PM, so you must wait until then. This is not feasible in a single day, so we need to adjust the schedule to fit Karen's meeting.\n\n### Revised Schedule:\n- Meet Sandra first (9:07 AM - 10:22 AM).\n- Travel to Marina District (12 minutes), arrive at 10:34 AM, wait until 11:00 AM, meet Nancy (11:00 AM - 12:45 PM).\n- Travel to Haight-Ashbury (16 minutes), arrive at 1:01 PM, meet Joseph (1:01 PM - 2:31 PM).\n- Travel to Nob Hill (15 minutes), arrive at 2:46 PM. Since Karen is only available at 9:15 PM, this schedule doesn't allow meeting her. \n\n### Alternative Approach:\nTo meet Karen, we must prioritize her meeting time (9:15 PM - 9:45 PM) and adjust other meetings accordingly. However, given the constraints, it's impossible to meet all four friends in one day because Karen's availability is too late in the day and conflicts with other meetings. \n\n### Final Solution:\nThe optimal schedule is to meet Sandra, Nancy, and Joseph, but skip Karen due to time constraints.\n\n```json\nSOLUTION:\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:07\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:22\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Nancy\",\n      \"start_time\": \"11:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"12:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:01\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:31\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
