Here's the best schedule I could devise:\n\n1. Start at The Castro at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Bayview to meet Rebecca (19 minutes). Arrive at 9:19 AM. Meet until 10:49 AM (90 minutes).\n3. Travel to Alamo Square to meet James (16 minutes). Arrive at 11:05 AM. Meet until 12:35 PM (90 minutes).\n4. Travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Melissa (9 minutes). Arrive at 12:44 PM. Meet until 2:14 PM (90 minutes).\n5. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Sarah (24 minutes). Arrive at 2:38 PM. Meet until 4:08 PM (90 minutes).\n6. Travel to Pacific Heights to meet Amanda (13 minutes). Arrive at 4:21 PM. However, Amanda is only available from 6:30 PM, so we need to adjust. \n\nThe above schedule doesn't account for Amanda's availability. Let's try again:\n\n1. Start at The Castro at 9:00 AM.\n2. Travel to Bayview to meet Rebecca (19 minutes). Arrive at 9:19 AM. Meet until 10:49 AM (90 minutes).\n3. Travel to Alamo Square to meet James (16 minutes). Arrive at 11:05 AM. Meet until 12:35 PM (90 minutes).\n4. Travel to Golden Gate Park to meet Melissa (9 minutes). Arrive at 12:44 PM. Meet until 2:14 PM (90 minutes).\n5. Travel to Fisherman's Wharf to meet Sarah (24 minutes). Arrive at 2:38 PM. Meet until 4:08 PM (90 minutes).\n6. Travel to Pacific Heights to meet Amanda (13 minutes). Arrive at 4:21 PM. Wait until 6:30 PM. Meet Amanda from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM (90 minutes).\n\nThis schedule meets all friends for the minimum required time.
