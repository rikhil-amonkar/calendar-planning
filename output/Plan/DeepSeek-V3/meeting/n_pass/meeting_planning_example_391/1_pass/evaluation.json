    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nTo optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible within the given constraints, we need to consider the travel times and the availability windows of each friend. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n1. **Meet Kimberly (Russian Hill)**:\n   - Available from 8:45 AM to 12:30 PM.\n   - Travel from Sunset District to Russian Hill: 24 minutes.\n   - Earliest arrival: 9:00 AM + 24 minutes = 9:24 AM.\n   - Minimum meeting time: 30 minutes.\n   - Latest departure: 12:30 PM - 30 minutes = 12:00 PM.\n   - Schedule: 9:24 AM to 9:54 AM (30 minutes).\n\n2. **Meet Kevin (Alamo Square)**:\n   - Available from 8:15 AM to 9:30 PM.\n   - Travel from Russian Hill to Alamo Square: 15 minutes.\n   - Depart Russian Hill at 9:54 AM, arrive Alamo Square at 10:09 AM.\n   - Minimum meeting time: 75 minutes.\n   - Latest departure: 9:30 PM - 75 minutes = 8:15 PM.\n   - Schedule: 10:09 AM to 11:24 AM (75 minutes).\n\n3. **Meet Joseph (Presidio)**:\n   - Available from 6:30 PM to 7:15 PM.\n   - Travel from Alamo Square to Presidio: 18 minutes.\n   - Depart Alamo Square at 11:24 AM, but Joseph is not available until 6:30 PM. This leaves a large gap. Instead, we can adjust the meeting with Kevin to end earlier to accommodate Joseph.\n   - Alternative: Meet Kevin from 10:09 AM to 11:24 AM (75 minutes), then free time until Joseph.\n   - Depart Alamo Square at 11:24 AM, but Joseph is at 6:30 PM. This is not optimal. Instead, we can meet Joseph first after Kimberly.\n   - Revised plan:\n     - After Kimberly (9:24 AM to 9:54 AM), travel to Presidio: Russian Hill to Presidio is 14 minutes.\n     - Arrive Presidio at 10:08 AM, but Joseph is not available until 6:30 PM. This doesn't work.\n   - Another option: Meet Kevin first, then Kimberly, then Joseph.\n     - Travel Sunset to Alamo Square: 17 minutes. Arrive at 9:17 AM.\n     - Meet Kevin: 9:17 AM to 10:32 AM (75 minutes).\n     - Travel Alamo Square to Russian Hill: 13 minutes. Arrive at 10:45 AM.\n     - Meet Kimberly: 10:45 AM to 11:15 AM (30 minutes).\n     - Travel Russian Hill to Presidio: 14 minutes. Arrive at 11:29 AM, but Joseph is not available until 6:30 PM. Still a gap.\n   - Best option: Meet Kimberly first, then Kevin, then Joseph, then Thomas.\n     - Kimberly: 9:24 AM to 9:54 AM.\n     - Kevin: 10:09 AM to 11:24 AM.\n     - Joseph: 6:30 PM to 7:15 PM (45 minutes).\n     - Travel Presidio to Financial District: 23 minutes. Arrive at 7:38 PM.\n     - Meet Thomas: 7:38 PM to 8:23 PM (45 minutes).\n\nFinal schedule:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kimberly\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:24\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:54\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Kevin\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:09\",\n      \"end_time\": \"11:24\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Joseph\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Thomas\",\n      \"start_time\": \"19:38\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:23\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
