    "execution_output": "SOLUTION:\nTo optimize meeting as many friends as possible within the given constraints, we need to carefully plan the schedule considering travel times and meeting durations. Here's the optimal itinerary:\n\n1. Start at Sunset District at 9:00 AM.\n2. Meet Margaret at Russian Hill (30 min minimum) - earliest possible after arrival.\n3. Meet Daniel at Golden Gate Park (15 min minimum) - after Margaret.\n4. Meet Charles at Alamo Square (90 min minimum) - in the evening.\n5. Meet Stephanie at Mission District (90 min minimum) - late evening.\n\nHere's the JSON schedule:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Margaret\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:24\",\n      \"end_time\": \"09:54\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Daniel\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:15\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Charles\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"19:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"20:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"22:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Travel from Sunset to Russian Hill takes 24 min (arrive at 9:24 AM). Meet Margaret until 9:54 AM.\n- Travel from Russian Hill to Golden Gate Park takes 21 min (arrive at 10:15 AM). Meet Daniel until 10:30 AM.\n- The rest of the day is free until Charles' availability at 6:00 PM. Travel from Golden Gate Park to Alamo Square takes 9 min, but since Charles is only available from 6:00 PM, we can arrive by then.\n- Meet Charles from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM (90 min).\n- Travel from Alamo Square to Mission District takes 10 min (arrive by 7:40 PM), but Stephanie is only available from 8:30 PM, so we wait until then.\n- Meet Stephanie from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM (90 min).\n\nThis schedule meets all friends with the minimum required durations while respecting travel times.",
