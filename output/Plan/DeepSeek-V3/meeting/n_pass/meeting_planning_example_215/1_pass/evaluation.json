    "execution_output": "To solve this problem, we need to create a schedule that allows us to meet all three friends (Jessica, Sandra, and Jason) while respecting the time constraints and travel times between locations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Location and Time**: Start at Bayview at 9:00 AM.\n2. **Jason's Meeting**: \n   - Jason is at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM. We need to meet him for at least 30 minutes.\n   - The latest we can arrive is 4:15 PM to meet him until 4:45 PM.\n   - Travel time from Bayview to Fisherman's Wharf is 25 minutes, so we must leave Bayview by 3:50 PM to arrive by 4:15 PM.\n   - However, this leaves a lot of idle time before the meeting. Alternatively, we can explore other locations before heading to Fisherman's Wharf.\n3. **Jessica's Meeting**:\n   - Jessica is at Embarcadero from 4:45 PM to 7:00 PM. We need to meet her for at least 30 minutes.\n   - The earliest we can meet her is 4:45 PM until 5:15 PM.\n   - Travel time from Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero is 8 minutes, so we can leave Fisherman's Wharf at 4:37 PM to arrive by 4:45 PM.\n   - This means we must finish meeting Jason by 4:37 PM, which is possible since his window ends at 4:45 PM (we can meet him from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM).\n4. **Sandra's Meeting**:\n   - Sandra is at Richmond District from 6:30 PM to 9:45 PM. We need to meet her for at least 120 minutes.\n   - The earliest we can meet her is 6:30 PM until 8:30 PM.\n   - Travel time from Embarcadero to Richmond District is 21 minutes, so we must leave Embarcadero by 6:09 PM to arrive by 6:30 PM.\n   - This means we must finish meeting Jessica by 6:09 PM. Since we can meet her from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM, this works.\n5. **Alternative Check**:\n   - If we meet Jessica later (e.g., 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM), we won't have enough time to meet Sandra for 120 minutes before her window ends at 9:45 PM (but we'd arrive at 6:51 PM, leaving only until 8:51 PM, which is acceptable). However, the earlier schedule is more straightforward.\n\n### Final Schedule:\n- Meet Jason at Fisherman's Wharf from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM.\n- Travel to Embarcadero (8 minutes), arrive by 4:38 PM.\n- Meet Jessica at Embarcadero from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM.\n- Travel to Richmond District (21 minutes), arrive by 6:06 PM.\n- Meet Sandra at Richmond District from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSOLUTION: The optimal schedule is to meet Jason from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM at Fisherman's Wharf, Jessica from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM at Embarcadero, and Sandra from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM at Richmond District. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:30\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jessica\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:45\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"18:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"20:30\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
