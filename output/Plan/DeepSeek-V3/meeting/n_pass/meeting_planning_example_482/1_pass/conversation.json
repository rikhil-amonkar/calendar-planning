        "content": "SOLUTION:\n\nTo optimize the schedule and meet as many friends as possible within the given constraints, we need to carefully plan the order of visits and ensure that the travel times and meeting durations fit into the available time slots. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n1. **Meet Richard at Pacific Heights**: Since Richard is only available until 10:15 AM and we arrive at Haight-Ashbury at 9:00 AM, we should go directly to Pacific Heights (12 minutes travel time). We can meet Richard from 9:12 AM to 10:15 AM (63 minutes), which is slightly less than the desired 75 minutes but the maximum possible given his availability.\n\n2. **Meet Stephanie at Mission District**: After meeting Richard, travel to Mission District (16 minutes from Pacific Heights). Arrive at 10:31 AM and meet Stephanie until 1:45 PM (194 minutes, well over the 90-minute minimum).\n\n3. **Meet Brian at Russian Hill**: After meeting Stephanie, travel to Russian Hill (15 minutes from Mission District). Arrive at 2:00 PM and meet Brian until 4:00 PM (120 minutes, exactly the desired duration).\n\n4. **Meet Sandra at Bayview**: After meeting Brian, travel to Bayview (23 minutes from Russian Hill). Arrive at 4:23 PM and meet Sandra until 4:38 PM (15 minutes, the minimum desired duration).\n\n5. **Meet Jason at Fisherman's Wharf**: After meeting Sandra, travel to Fisherman's Wharf (26 minutes from Bayview). Arrive at 5:04 PM and meet Jason until 5:45 PM (41 minutes, slightly less than the desired 60 minutes but the maximum possible given the remaining time).\n\nHere is the schedule in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Richard\",\n      \"start_time\": \"09:12\",\n      \"end_time\": \"10:15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Stephanie\",\n      \"start_time\": \"10:31\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:45\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Brian\",\n      \"start_time\": \"14:00\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Sandra\",\n      \"start_time\": \"16:23\",\n      \"end_time\": \"16:38\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Jason\",\n      \"start_time\": \"17:04\",\n      \"end_time\": \"17:45\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis schedule allows you to meet all five friends, though some meetings are slightly shorter than desired due to time constraints. Adjustments could be made if you prioritize certain friends over others."
