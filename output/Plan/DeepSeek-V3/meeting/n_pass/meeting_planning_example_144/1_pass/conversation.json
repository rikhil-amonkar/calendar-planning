Travel to the Financial District to meet Anthony first (20 minutes travel time, arriving at 9:20 AM). However, Anthony is only available from 12:30 PM to 2:45 PM, so this isn't feasible. Instead, we'll wait until Anthony's availability.\n3. Travel to the Mission District to meet Laura (7 minutes travel time, arriving at 9:07 AM). However, Laura is only available from 12:15 PM, so this isn't feasible either.\n4. The optimal schedule is to wait at The Castro until it's time to travel to meet Anthony first, then meet Laura afterward.\n\nHere's the detailed schedule:\n\n- Leave The Castro at 11:40 AM (to arrive at Financial District by 12:00 PM, but Anthony is only available at 12:30 PM, so adjust departure to 12:10 PM to arrive at 12:30 PM).\n- Meet Anthony from 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM (30 minutes).\n- Leave Financial District at 1:00 PM, travel to Mission District (17 minutes), arrive at 1:17 PM.\n- Meet Laura from 1:17 PM to 2:32 PM (75 minutes).\n\nFinal JSON schedule:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Anthony\",\n      \"start_time\": \"12:30\",\n      \"end_time\": \"13:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"meet\",\n      \"person\": \"Laura\",\n      \"start_time\": \"13:17\",\n      \"end_time\": \"14:32\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
