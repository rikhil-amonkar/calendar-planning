Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Cities and Required Stays:\n1. **Dubrovnik**: 4 days\n2. **Split**: 3 days\n3. **Milan**: 3 days (with wedding between Day 11-13)\n4. **Porto**: 4 days\n5. **Krakow**: 2 days (with friends between Day 8-9)\n6. **Munich**: 5 days (annual show from Day 4-8)\n\n### Direct Flight Connections:\n- Munich \u2013 Porto\n- Split \u2013 Milan\n- Milan \u2013 Porto\n- Munich \u2013 Krakow\n- Munich \u2013 Milan\n- Dubrovnik \u2013 Munich\n- Krakow \u2013 Split\n- Krakow \u2013 Milan\n- Munich \u2013 Split\n\n### Constraints:\n- Wedding in Milan between Day 11-13.\n- Friends in Krakow between Day 8-9.\n- Annual show in Munich from Day 4-8.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Identify Fixed Blocks**:\n   - Munich show: Day 4-8 (must be in Munich these days).\n   - Krakow friends: Day 8-9 (must be in Krakow these days).\n   - Milan wedding: Day 11-13 (must be in Milan these days).\n\n2. **Determine Possible Orders**:\n   - Before Munich (Day 1-3): Could be Dubrovnik or another city, but Dubrovnik is only connected to Munich directly.\n   - After Krakow (Day 10): Need to get to Milan by Day 11.\n   - After Milan (Day 14-16): Could be Porto or another remaining city.\n\n3. **Start Filling the Itinerary**:\n   - **Day 1-3**: Start in Dubrovnik (4 days total, but we can't stay all 4 here because Munich starts on Day 4). Maybe stay Day 1-3 in Dubrovnik, then fly to Munich on Day 4.\n     - Dubrovnik: Day 1-3 (3 days), then fly to Munich on Day 4 (counts for both).\n     - But Dubrovnik needs 4 days, so maybe Day 1-4 in Dubrovnik, fly to Munich on Day 4. But Munich show starts on Day 4, so Day 4 would be in both Dubrovnik and Munich, which is fine.\n     - So Dubrovnik: Day 1-4 (including flight day).\n     - Munich: Day 4-8 (show is covered).\n   - **Day 8-9**: Must be in Krakow. From Munich, can fly directly to Krakow on Day 8.\n     - Krakow: Day 8-9 (2 days total, including flight day).\n   - **Day 10**: Need to get to Milan by Day 11. From Krakow, can fly to Milan or Split.\n     - Krakow to Milan is direct, but Milan wedding is Day 11-13, so maybe arrive in Milan on Day 10.\n     - Milan: Day 10-13 (4 days total, but only need 3. So maybe arrive Day 11.\n     - Alternatively, spend Day 10 in another city, but we've already done Dubrovnik, Munich, Krakow. Remaining: Split, Porto.\n     - From Krakow, can fly to Split (direct), then Split to Milan (direct).\n     - Split needs 3 days. Maybe:\n       - Day 10-12 in Split, fly to Milan on Day 13 (but wedding is Day 11-13).\n       - Doesn't work. Maybe:\n       - Day 10 in Split, fly to Milan on Day 11.\n         - Split: Day 10 (1 day), but need 3.\n       - Not working. Maybe better to go directly to Milan from Krakow on Day 10.\n         - Milan: Day 10-13 (4 days), but only need 3. So maybe fly out on Day 13.\n   - **Day 13-16**: Need to assign Porto (4 days) and Split (3 days).\n     - From Milan, can fly to Porto or Split.\n     - Porto needs 4 days, Split needs 3. We have 4 days left (Day 13-16).\n     - Maybe Porto: Day 13-16 (4 days), but then no time for Split.\n     - Or Split: Day 13-15, fly to Porto on Day 16 (but Porto needs 4 days).\n     - Not enough days left. Maybe adjust earlier.\n   - Alternative: After Krakow (Day 9), go to Split, then Milan.\n     - Krakow to Split is direct.\n     - Split: Day 9-11 (3 days), fly to Milan on Day 12.\n     - Milan: Day 12-14 (3 days), but wedding is Day 11-13. Doesn't match.\n   - Another try:\n     - Dubrovnik: Day 1-4\n     - Munich: Day 4-8\n     - Krakow: Day 8-9\n     - From Krakow, fly to Split on Day 10.\n       - Split: Day 10-12 (3 days)\n     - Fly to Milan on Day 13.\n       - Milan: Day 13-15 (3 days), but wedding is Day 11-13. Doesn't fit.\n   - Maybe start with Split first:\n     - But Split is only connected to Milan, Krakow, Munich.\n     - Not straightforward.\n\n4. **Re-evaluate Initial Assignments**:\n   - Maybe assign Munich as Day 4-8, then Krakow Day 8-9, then Split Day 10-12, Milan Day 12-14, Porto Day 14-17 (but only 16 days).\n     - Porto would be Day 14-16 (3 days), but needs 4.\n   - Not working. Maybe reduce Munich by a day? But show is Day 4-8 (5 days), and Munich is 5 days total, so can't.\n   - Maybe Dubrovnik is not first. Try starting in Munich:\n     - But show is Day 4-8, so can't be in Munich before Day 4 unless we overlap.\n   - Maybe:\n     - Day 1-3: Split\n     - Day 4-8: Munich\n     - Day 8-9: Krakow\n     - Day 10-12: Dubrovnik\n     - Day 13-15: Milan\n     - Day 16: Porto (but needs 4)\n     - Not enough.\n\n5. **Final Attempt**:\n   - Dubrovnik: Day 1-4 (4 days)\n   - Munich: Day 4-8 (5 days, includes flight day)\n   - Krakow: Day 8-9 (2 days)\n   - Split: Day 10-12 (3 days)\n   - Milan: Day 12-14 (3 days, wedding on Day 12-13)\n   - Porto: Day 14-17 (but only to Day 16) \u2192 3 days, needs 4.\n   - Not enough for Porto.\n\n   Maybe:\n   - Dubrovnik: Day 1-4\n   - Munich: Day 4-8\n   - Krakow: Day 8-9\n   - Milan: Day 10-12 (wedding Day 11-12)\n   - Split: Day 13-15\n   - Porto: Day 15-18 \u2192 over.\n   - Not working.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   After several attempts, here's a feasible itinerary:\n   - **Dubrovnik**: Day 1-4 (4 days, fly to Munich on Day 4)\n   - **Munich**: Day 4-8 (5 days, includes Day 4 from Dubrovnik)\n   - **Krakow**: Day 8-9 (2 days, fly from Munich on Day 8)\n   - **Split**: Day 10-12 (3 days, fly from Krakow on Day 10)\n   - **Milan**: Day 12-14 (3 days, fly from Split on Day 12; wedding Day 12-13)\n   - **Porto**: Day 14-17 (but only to Day 16) \u2192 Actually, Day 14-16 is 3 days, but Porto needs 4. Not possible.\n\n   Realizing we can't fit Porto fully, maybe adjust:\n   - **Dubrovnik**: Day 1-4\n   - **Munich**: Day 4-8\n   - **Krakow**: Day 8-9\n   - **Milan**: Day 10-12 (wedding Day 11-12)\n   - **Split**: Day 13-15\n   - **Porto**: Day 15-16 (2 days) \u2192 Still short.\n\n   Seems impossible to fit all cities with given constraints. Maybe omit one city or adjust durations.\n\n   Given the constraints, here's the closest possible (omitting Porto's full duration):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Dubrovnik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-9\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-12\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-14\", \"place\": \"Milan\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-16\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nBut Porto is only 3 days here (14,15,16). Alternatively, maybe Split is not fully covered.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the only feasible plan that meets most constraints (though Porto is short by 1 day) is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Dubrovnik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-9\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-12\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-14\", \"place\": \"Milan\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-16\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\nAfter carefully considering all constraints and flight connections, here's the optimal itinerary that meets most requirements (with Porto slightly short by one day due to tight scheduling):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Dubrovnik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-9\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-12\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-14\", \"place\": \"Milan\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-16\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Dubrovnik**: Day 1-4 (4 days, fly to Munich on Day 4)\n- **Munich**: Day 4-8 (5 days, includes flight day; covers show from Day 4-8)\n- **Krakow**: Day 8-9 (2 days, fly from Munich on Day 8; meets friends on Day 8-9)\n- **Split**: Day 10-12 (3 days, fly from Krakow on Day 10)\n- **Milan**: Day 12-14 (3 days, fly from Split on Day 12; wedding on Day 12-13)\n- **Porto**: Day 14-16 (3 days, fly from Milan on Day 14; short by 1 day from required 4)\n\nThis is the closest possible itinerary given the constraints. To fully meet Porto's 4-day requirement, you might need to adjust one other city's stay by reducing it by a day."

Let\u2019s fix this by reworking the schedule to ensure no gaps/overlaps and all stays are fulfilled.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Fixed Blocks**:\n   - **Munich show**: Day 4-8 (must be in Munich).\n   - **Krakow friends**: Day 8-9 (must include these days).\n   - **Milan wedding**: Day 11-13 (must be in Milan).\n\n2. **Key Adjustments**:\n   - After Krakow (Day 9), immediately fly to the next city to avoid gaps.\n   - Assign **Split** before Milan to use its direct flight to Milan.\n   - Extend **Porto** by shifting other stays.\n\n3. **New Itinerary**:\n   - **Dubrovnik**: Day 1-4 (fly to Munich on Day 4).\n   - **Munich**: Day 4-8 (includes flight day; show covered).\n   - **Krakow**: Day 8-9 (fly to Split on Day 9).\n   - **Split**: Day 9-11 (fly to Milan on Day 11).\n   - **Milan**: Day 11-13 (wedding covered).\n   - **Porto**: Day 13-16 (4 days, fly from Milan on Day 13).\n\n### Why This Works:\n- **No gaps**: Flights are on the same day as the last day in a city (e.g., fly out of Krakow on Day 9 to Split).\n- **All stays fulfilled**:\n  - Dubrovnik: 4 days (Day 1-4).\n  - Munich: 5 days (Day 4-8, includes flight day).\n  - Krakow: 2 days (Day 8-9, includes flight day).\n  - Split: 3 days (Day 9-11, includes flight day).\n  - Milan: 3 days (Day 11-13, includes flight day).\n  - Porto: 4 days (Day 13-16).\n- **Flight connections**:\n  - Dubrovnik \u2192 Munich (direct).\n  - Munich \u2192 Krakow (direct).\n  - Krakow \u2192 Split (direct).\n  - Split \u2192 Milan (direct).\n  - Milan \u2192 Porto (direct).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Dubrovnik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-9\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-11\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-13\", \"place\": \"Milan\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-16\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Dubrovnik (Day 1-4)**:\n   - Stay 4 days, fly to Munich on Day 4 (counts for both cities).\n2. **Munich (Day 4-8)**:\n   - 5 days (includes Day 4 arrival; covers show from Day 4-8).\n3. **Krakow (Day 8-9)**:\n   - Fly from Munich on Day 8, stay 2 days (includes flight day; friends on Day 8-9).\n4. **Split (Day 9-11)**:\n   - Fly from Krakow on Day 9, stay 3 days (includes flight day).\n5. **Milan (Day 11-13)**:\n   - Fly from Split on Day 11, stay 3 days (wedding on Day 11-13).\n6. **Porto (Day 13-16)**:\n   - Fly from Milan on Day 13, stay 4 days (full duration met).\n\nThis plan satisfies all constraints, flight connections, and avoids gaps/overlaps."
