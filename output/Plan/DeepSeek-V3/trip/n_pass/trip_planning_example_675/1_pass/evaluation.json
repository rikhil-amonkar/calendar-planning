    "execution_output": "Alright, let's tackle this European city trip planning step by step. We have six cities to visit over 16 days, with specific durations and constraints for each. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Cities and Required Stays:\n1. **Dubrovnik**: 4 days\n2. **Split**: 3 days\n3. **Milan**: 3 days (with wedding between Day 11-13)\n4. **Porto**: 4 days\n5. **Krakow**: 2 days (with friends between Day 8-9)\n6. **Munich**: 5 days (with annual show between Day 4-8)\n\n### Direct Flight Connections:\n- Munich \u2013 Porto\n- Split \u2013 Milan\n- Milan \u2013 Porto\n- Munich \u2013 Krakow\n- Munich \u2013 Milan\n- Dubrovnik \u2013 Munich\n- Krakow \u2013 Split\n- Krakow \u2013 Milan\n- Munich \u2013 Split\n\n### Constraints:\n1. **Munich's Show**: Must be in Munich from Day 4 to Day 8 (inclusive). That's 5 days (Day 4,5,6,7,8).\n   - Since Munich requires 5 days total, and we're already there for 5 consecutive days, no additional Munich days are needed.\n2. **Krakow Friends**: Must be in Krakow between Day 8-9.\n   - Since we're in Munich until Day 8, we must fly to Krakow on Day 8.\n   - Day 8 is counted in both Munich and Krakow.\n   - Krakow requires 2 days, so Day 8-9 (but Day 8 is the travel day from Munich).\n3. **Milan Wedding**: Must be in Milan between Day 11-13.\n   - So, Milan must include Day 11,12,13.\n   - Milan requires 3 days total, which can be covered by these 3 days.\n4. Other cities' stays must fit around these fixed constraints.\n\n### Step-by-Step Itinerary:\n\n**Initial Fixed Blocks:**\n- Munich: Day 4-8 (show)\n- Krakow: Day 8-9 (friends)\n- Milan: Day 11-13 (wedding)\n\nNow, let's place the other cities around these.\n\n**Total Days: 16**\n\n**Remaining Cities to Place: Dubrovnik (4), Split (3), Porto (4)**\n\n**Available Day Ranges:**\n- Before Munich: Day 1-3\n- Between Munich/Krakow and Milan: Day 10\n- After Milan: Day 14-16\n\nBut we have to connect flights properly.\n\n**Starting Point:**\nWe can start in any city that has flights to others. Let's consider starting in Dubrovnik since it's only connected to Munich.\n\n**Option: Start in Dubrovnik (Day 1-4)**\n- Dubrovnik: Day 1-4 (4 days)\n   - On Day 4, fly to Munich (direct flight exists).\n   - Munich: Day 4-8 (already fixed)\n   - Krakow: Day 8-9\n   - Now, after Krakow (Day 9), where can we go?\n     - From Krakow, can fly to Split, Milan, or Munich.\n     - Next is Milan on Day 11, so need to be in Milan by Day 11.\n     - Maybe go to Split from Krakow.\n   - Split: Let's say Day 9-12\n     - From Split, can fly to Milan directly.\n     - But Milan is needed from Day 11-13.\n     - If Split is Day 9-12, then on Day 12 fly to Milan.\n     - But Milan is only needed from Day 11, so overlap:\n       - Split: Day 9-11 (3 days: 9,10,11)\n       - On Day 11, fly to Milan (Split-Milan direct)\n       - Milan: Day 11-13\n   - Then after Milan (Day 13), where to go?\n     - From Milan, can fly to Porto or Split.\n     - Need to do Porto (4 days), and we have Day 14-16 left (3 days), but Porto needs 4.\n     - Issue: Not enough days left after Milan for Porto.\n   - Maybe adjust Split to be shorter, but it needs 3 days.\n\nAlternative: Maybe start in Porto.\n\n**Option: Start in Porto (Day 1-4)**\n- Porto: Day 1-4\n   - From Porto, can fly to Munich or Milan.\n   - Next is Munich show from Day 4-8.\n   - Fly Porto to Munich on Day 4.\n   - Munich: Day 4-8\n   - Krakow: Day 8-9\n   - Then from Krakow, where?\n     - Need to be in Milan by Day 11.\n     - From Krakow, can go to Split: Split Day 9-12\n       - Then Milan Day 12-14 (but wedding is Day 11-13)\n       - Doesn't fit.\n     - Or Krakow to Milan: but wedding is Day 11-13, and it's only Day 9.\n       - Milan Day 9-12 (but wedding is 11-13), so overlap.\n       - Not ideal.\n   - Seems messy.\n\n**Better Option: Start in Dubrovnik, adjust Split and Porto.**\n\n- Dubrovnik: Day 1-4\n   - Fly to Munich on Day 4.\n- Munich: Day 4-8\n   - Fly to Krakow on Day 8.\n- Krakow: Day 8-9\n   - Fly to Split on Day 9.\n- Split: Day 9-12 (but needs only 3 days: 9,10,11)\n   - On Day 11, fly to Milan.\n- Milan: Day 11-13\n   - From Milan, fly to Porto on Day 13.\n- Porto: Day 13-16 (4 days: 13,14,15,16)\n\nCheck days:\n- Dubrovnik: 1,2,3,4 (4)\n- Munich: 4,5,6,7,8 (5)\n- Krakow: 8,9 (2)\n- Split: 9,10,11 (3)\n- Milan: 11,12,13 (3)\n- Porto: 13,14,15,16 (4)\nTotal: 16 days.\n\nCheck flights:\n- Dubrovnik to Munich: Direct (OK)\n- Munich to Krakow: Direct (OK)\n- Krakow to Split: Direct (OK)\n- Split to Milan: Direct (OK)\n- Milan to Porto: Direct (OK)\n\nAll constraints:\n- Munich show Day 4-8: Covered.\n- Krakow friends Day 8-9: Covered (Day 8 in Munich and Krakow, Day 9 in Krakow and Split).\n- Milan wedding Day 11-13: Covered (Day 11 in Split and Milan, Day 12-13 in Milan).\n- All city stays meet required days.\n\n### Final Itinerary in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Dubrovnik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-9\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-11\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-13\", \"place\": \"Milan\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-16\", \"place\": \"Porto\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
