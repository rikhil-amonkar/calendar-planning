        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this European city-hopping adventure step by step. We have 10 cities to visit over 25 days, with specific constraints on when and how long to stay in each, and only certain direct flights between them. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. List the Cities and Required Stays:\n- **Valencia**: 2 days, must be between day 3-4 (so days 3-4 or 4-5, but since we need to meet friends between day 3-4, likely days 3-4).\n- **Oslo**: 3 days, meet friend between day 13-15.\n- **Lyon**: 4 days.\n- **Prague**: 3 days.\n- **Paris**: 4 days.\n- **Nice**: 4 days.\n- **Seville**: 5 days, annual show days 5-9 (so must be in Seville from day 5-9).\n- **Tallinn**: 2 days.\n- **Mykonos**: 5 days, wedding between day 21-25.\n- **Lisbon**: 2 days.\n\n### 2. Understand Flight Connections:\nFrom the given list, let's note direct flights for each city (this will help in sequencing):\n\n- **Lisbon**: Paris, Seville, Prague, Nice, Valencia, Oslo, Lyon\n- **Paris**: Lisbon, Oslo, Valencia, Nice, Lyon, Tallinn, Seville, Prague\n- **Lyon**: Nice, Prague, Paris, Valencia, Oslo, Lisbon\n- **Nice**: Lyon, Paris, Oslo, Mykonos, Lisbon\n- **Oslo**: Tallinn, Paris, Prague, Nice, Lyon, Lisbon\n- **Prague**: Lyon, Lisbon, Paris, Oslo, Tallinn, Valencia\n- **Seville**: Lisbon, Paris, Valencia\n- **Tallinn**: Oslo, Paris, Prague\n- **Valencia**: Paris, Lisbon, Lyon, Prague, Seville\n- **Mykonos**: Nice\n\n### 3. Fix the Non-Negotiable Stays:\n- **Seville**: Must be days 5-9 (5 days).\n- **Mykonos**: Wedding days 21-25 (5 days). Must fly from Nice (only direct flight is Nice-Mykonos).\n- **Valencia**: Meet friends between day 3-4. So likely days 3-4 (since day 4 is also part of Oslo or another city if we fly out on day 4).\n  \nGiven Seville is days 5-9, and Valencia is days 3-4, let's see how to get from Valencia to Seville. From the flights, Valencia-Seville is direct, so we can fly on day 5 (but day 5 is start of Seville). So Valencia is days 3-4, fly to Seville on day 5 (but day 5 is Seville, so overlap? Wait, flight day counts for both.\n\nWait, if we're in Valencia days 3-4, then on day 5 we're in Seville. So flight is day 5, which is first day in Seville and last day in Valencia? That doesn't add up because Valencia is only 2 days (3-4). Maybe Valencia is days 2-3, then fly to Seville on day 4 (but Seville starts day 5). Hmm.\n\nAlternative: Valencia days 4-5 (meet friends between day 3-4, so day 4 is in Valencia), then fly to Seville on day 5 (first day in Seville). So Valencia is days 4-5, Seville is days 5-9.\n\nBut then what's before Valencia? Let's say start in Lisbon (2 days), then fly to Valencia on day 3 (Lisbon-Valencia direct), so Lisbon days 1-2, Valencia days 3-4, fly to Seville on day 5 (Valencia-Seville direct), Seville days 5-9.\n\nThen from Seville, where to next? Seville has flights to Lisbon, Paris, Valencia. Lisbon is already visited, Valencia too, so Paris. Fly to Paris on day 10 (last day in Seville is day 9, so day 10 is flight to Paris and first day there). Paris is 4 days, so days 10-13.\n\nFrom Paris, where next? Oslo is needed between day 13-15. Paris-Oslo direct, so fly to Oslo on day 14 (Paris days 10-13, Oslo starts day 14). Oslo is 3 days, so days 14-16 (but need to meet friend between day 13-15, so Oslo should include day 13. Maybe adjust Paris to days 10-12, Oslo days 13-15.\n\nThen from Oslo, where? Oslo has flights to Tallinn, Paris, Prague, Nice, Lyon, Lisbon. Next is Lyon (4 days), Prague (3), Nice (4), Tallinn (2). Let's do Tallinn next (2 days), then Prague (3), then Lyon (4), then Nice (4), then Mykonos (5).\n\nOslo to Tallinn direct, so fly on day 16 (Oslo days 13-15, Tallinn days 16-17).\nTallinn to Prague direct, fly on day 18 (Prague days 18-20).\nPrague to Lyon direct, fly on day 21 (Lyon days 21-24).\nBut Mykonos wedding is days 21-25, so conflict. Need to be in Mykonos by day 21. So Lyon must end before day 21. Maybe rearrange.\n\nAlternative after Oslo: Oslo to Prague (days 13-15 Oslo, fly to Prague on day 16, Prague days 16-18).\nPrague to Lyon, fly on day 19, Lyon days 19-22.\nBut Mykonos is days 21-25, so need to be in Nice by day 20 to fly to Mykonos on day 21 (Nice-Mykonos only flight). So Lyon can't be until day 22. Maybe Lyon is days 19-22, but then Nice is days 23-26 which exceeds 25. Not working.\n\nAlternative: After Oslo, go to Nice, then Mykonos. Oslo-Nice direct, so Oslo days 13-15, Nice days 16-19, fly to Mykonos on day 20 (but wedding is days 21-25, so Mykonos days 20-24). Then days left? Original plan had Lyon 4, Prague 3, Tallinn 2 not yet placed. After Mykonos, day 25 is last, but we have days left. Maybe start differently.\n\nAlternative start: Start in Prague (3 days), then to Oslo (3), then Tallinn (2), then Paris (4), then Lyon (4), then Nice (4), then Mykonos (5). But then where to fit Seville, Valencia, Lisbon.\n\nThis is getting messy. Maybe better to list all cities and assign days step by step, ensuring flights connect.\n\n### 4. Construct the Itinerary Step-by-Step:\n\nLet me try this sequence:\n\n1. **Lisbon**: 2 days (days 1-2)\n   - Next: fly to Valencia (Lisbon-Valencia direct)\n2. **Valencia**: 2 days (days 3-4)\n   - Meet friends between day 3-4\n   - Next: fly to Seville (Valencia-Seville direct) on day 5\n3. **Seville**: 5 days (days 5-9)\n   - Annual show days 5-9\n   - Next: fly to Paris (Seville-Paris direct) on day 10\n4. **Paris**: 4 days (days 10-13)\n   - Next: fly to Oslo (Paris-Oslo direct) on day 14\n5. **Oslo**: 3 days (days 14-16)\n   - Meet friend between day 13-15 (so day 14 is in Oslo)\n   - Next: fly to Tallinn (Oslo-Tallinn direct) on day 17\n6. **Tallinn**: 2 days (days 17-18)\n   - Next: fly to Prague (Tallinn-Prague direct) on day 19\n7. **Prague**: 3 days (days 19-21)\n   - Next: fly to Lyon (Prague-Lyon direct) on day 22\n8. **Lyon**: 4 days (days 22-25)\n   - But Mykonos wedding is days 21-25, so conflict. Need to be in Mykonos by day 21.\n   \nIssue: Mykonos needs to be days 21-25, but we're in Prague until day 21. Only flight from Prague is to Lyon, Tallinn, Oslo, Paris, Valencia, Lisbon. No direct to Nice or Mykonos. So need to adjust.\n\nAlternative after Oslo:\n\n5. **Oslo**: 3 days (days 14-16)\n   - Next: fly to Nice (Oslo-Nice direct) on day 17\n6. **Nice**: 4 days (days 17-20)\n   - Next: fly to Mykonos (Nice-Mykonos direct) on day 21\n7. **Mykonos**: 5 days (days 21-25)\n   - Wedding days 21-25\n   \nNow, remaining cities: Lyon (4), Prague (3), Tallinn (2). We've used days 1-25, but missing these. Maybe start differently.\n\nAlternative start with Prague:\n\n1. **Prague**: 3 days (days 1-3)\n   - Next: fly to Valencia (Prague-Valencia direct) on day 4\n2. **Valencia**: 2 days (days 4-5)\n   - Meet friends between day 3-4 (so day 4 is in Valencia)\n   - Next: fly to Seville (Valencia-Seville direct) on day 6\n3. **Seville**: 5 days (days 6-10)\n   - Annual show days 5-9 \u2192 but we're in Seville days 6-10, so show is days 6-10, but original is days 5-9. Conflict.\n   \nNot working. Maybe another approach.\n\n### 5. Final Itinerary Attempt:\n\nHere's a working sequence:\n\n1. **Lisbon**: days 1-2\n   - Fly to Valencia (Lisbon-Valencia)\n2. **Valencia**: days 3-4\n   - Fly to Seville (Valencia-Seville)\n3. **Seville**: days 5-9\n   - Fly to Paris (Seville-Paris)\n4. **Paris**: days 10-13\n   - Fly to Oslo (Paris-Oslo)\n5. **Oslo**: days 14-16\n   - Fly to Tallinn (Oslo-Tallinn)\n6. **Tallinn**: days 17-18\n   - Fly to Prague (Tallinn-Prague)\n7. **Prague**: days 19-21\n   - Fly to Lyon (Prague-Lyon)\n8. **Lyon**: days 22-25\n   - But missing Nice and Mykonos. Need to fit Nice before Mykonos.\n\nAdjust:\n\nAfter Oslo (days 14-16), fly to Nice (Oslo-Nice):\n6. **Nice**: days 17-20\n   - Fly to Mykonos (Nice-Mykonos)\n7. **Mykonos**: days 21-25\n\nNow missing Prague (3), Lyon (4), Tallinn (2). Maybe skip Tallinn or adjust.\n\nAlternative: include Tallinn after Oslo, then Prague, then Lyon, but then Nice and Mykonos don't fit.\n\nGiven time, here's a feasible itinerary missing some cities or adjusting stays, but here's one that fits most:\n\n### Final JSON Itinerary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Lisbon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-9\", \"place\": \"Seville\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-13\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-16\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-20\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21-25\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis covers 7 cities. To include all, we'd need to adjust stays or overlap, which may not fit the constraints. The above meets most key constraints (Seville show, Valencia meet, Oslo meet, Mykonos wedding) but misses Prague, Lyon, Tallinn due to time. A more optimized sequence could include them by reducing stays elsewhere if possible."
