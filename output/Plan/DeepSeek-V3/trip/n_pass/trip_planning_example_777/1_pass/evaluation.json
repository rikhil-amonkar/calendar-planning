    "execution_output": "Alright, let's tackle this European city-hopping adventure step by step. We have six cities to visit over 15 days, with specific durations and constraints for each. Here's how I'll approach planning the itinerary:\n\n### Cities and Required Stays:\n1. **Dublin**: 5 days\n2. **Helsinki**: 3 days (with friends between day 3 and day 5)\n3. **Riga**: 3 days\n4. **Reykjavik**: 2 days\n5. **Vienna**: 2 days (annual show from day 2 to day 3)\n6. **Tallinn**: 5 days (wedding between day 7 and day 11)\n\n### Direct Flight Connections:\nFrom the given connections, let's list possible direct flights between cities:\n- Helsinki \u2194 Riga\n- Riga \u2192 Tallinn\n- Riga \u2194 Vienna\n- Riga \u2194 Dublin\n- Vienna \u2194 Riga\n- Reykjavik \u2194 Vienna\n- Helsinki \u2194 Dublin\n- Tallinn \u2194 Dublin\n- Reykjavik \u2194 Helsinki\n- Reykjavik \u2194 Dublin\n- Helsinki \u2194 Tallinn\n- Vienna \u2194 Dublin\n\n### Constraints:\n1. **Vienna's Annual Show**: Must be in Vienna from day 2 to day 3. This means:\n   - Arrive in Vienna by day 2.\n   - Stay at least until day 3 (since the show is from day 2 to day 3, implying day 2 is the start and day 3 is the end).\n\n2. **Helsinki with Friends**: Must be in Helsinki between day 3 and day 5 (i.e., days 4 and 5 could be in Helsinki if we're there from day 3 to day 5).\n\n3. **Tallinn Wedding**: Must be in Tallinn between day 7 and day 11.\n\n### Planning Steps:\n\n**Day 1: Start somewhere.**\nLet's consider starting in a city that has good connections to others. Possible starting points could be Dublin, Reykjavik, or Vienna (since we need to be in Vienna by day 2).\n\nOption 1: Start in Vienna on day 1.\n- Day 1-2: Vienna (but the show is from day 2 to day 3, so we'd need to be there until day 3.\nWait, the show is from day 2 to day 3, meaning:\n- Day 2: show starts\n- Day 3: show ends\nSo we need to be in Vienna from day 2 to day 3. That means we can arrive on day 2 or before.\n\nAlternative: Start in another city on day 1, then fly to Vienna by day 2.\n\nPossible starting cities with flights to Vienna:\n- Reykjavik\n- Riga\n- Dublin\n\nLet's try starting in Dublin on day 1.\n\n**Option: Start in Dublin**\n- Day 1: Dublin\nFrom Dublin, can fly to Vienna directly (yes, according to connections).\n- Day 2: Fly to Vienna (counts as day in both Dublin and Vienna)\nBut we need to be in Vienna from day 2 to day 3, so:\n- Day 1: Dublin\n- Day 2: Dublin (morning) \u2192 Vienna (afternoon) (counts as day in Vienna)\n- Day 3: Vienna (show ends)\nBut we've only spent 1 full day in Vienna (day 3), but we need 2 days in Vienna total. Maybe:\n- Day 1: Dublin\n- Day 2: Dublin \u2192 Vienna (arrive day 2)\n- Day 3: Vienna (show ends)\n- Day 4: Vienna (but we've already had day 2 and 3 in Vienna, totaling 2 days (day 2 arrival and day 3). So day 4 would be extra.\n\nWait, counting:\n- Arrive Vienna day 2: counts as day in Vienna\n- Day 3: Vienna\nTotal Vienna: 2 days (day 2 and 3), which fits the 2-day requirement.\n\nThen from Vienna, where to next? Need to go to Helsinki to meet friends between day 3 and day 5.\n\nFrom Vienna, can fly to:\n- Riga\n- Reykjavik\n- Dublin\n\nNo direct to Helsinki from Vienna. So need to go via another city.\n\nFrom Vienna to Riga, then Riga to Helsinki.\n\nBut let's see timing:\nCurrent plan:\n- Day 1: Dublin\n- Day 2: Dublin \u2192 Vienna\n- Day 3: Vienna\nNow day 4: need to be in Helsinki by day 5 at latest to meet friends between day 3 and day 5.\n\nFrom Vienna to Riga (day 4), then Riga to Helsinki (day 5):\n- Day 4: Vienna \u2192 Riga\n- Day 5: Riga \u2192 Helsinki\nBut friends are between day 3 and day 5, so need to be in Helsinki by day 3 to day 5. This plan only gets us there by day 5, which is the end of the window.\n\nAlternative: from Vienna, fly to Reykjavik, then Reykjavik to Helsinki.\n\nBut Reykjavik is only 2 days total, and we haven't allocated that yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start in Reykjavik.\n\n**Alternative Start: Reykjavik**\n- Day 1: Reykjavik\nFrom Reykjavik, can fly to Vienna directly.\n- Day 2: Reykjavik \u2192 Vienna (arrive day 2, in time for show)\n- Day 3: Vienna\nNow need to go to Helsinki by day 5.\nFrom Vienna, can go to Riga, then Helsinki:\n- Day 4: Vienna \u2192 Riga\n- Day 5: Riga \u2192 Helsinki\nThis gets us to Helsinki by day 5, which is the end of the window for meeting friends (day 3-5). Not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, from Vienna to Dublin, then Dublin to Helsinki:\n- Day 4: Vienna \u2192 Dublin\n- Day 5: Dublin \u2192 Helsinki\nBut Dublin is 5 days total, and we'd have only spent day 1 in Reykjavik, day 2-3 in Vienna, day 4 in Dublin, day 5 to Helsinki. Dublin would need more days later.\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe better to start in Vienna.\n\n**Option: Start in Vienna**\n- Day 1: Vienna\n- Day 2: Vienna (show starts)\n- Day 3: Vienna (show ends)\nNow need to go to Helsinki by day 5.\nFrom Vienna, can go to Riga:\n- Day 4: Vienna \u2192 Riga\n- Day 5: Riga \u2192 Helsinki\nThis gets us to Helsinki by day 5, meeting the window (day 3-5), but only arriving on day 5.\nNot great for meeting friends between day 3-5.\n\nAlternatively, from Vienna to Reykjavik:\n- Day 4: Vienna \u2192 Reykjavik\n- Day 5: Reykjavik \u2192 Helsinki\nSame issue.\n\nMaybe better to adjust Helsinki's meeting window interpretation: \"between day 3 and day 5\" could mean any time within that span, not necessarily starting or ending there. So arriving by day 5 is okay if we stay past day 5.\n\nBut let's think differently: maybe Helsinki is not the first city after Vienna.\n\nAlternative plan:\nStart in Dublin:\n- Day 1-2: Dublin\n- Day 3: Dublin \u2192 Vienna (but show is day 2-3, so too late.\n\nNot working.\n\nAlternative: start in Riga.\n- Day 1: Riga\nFrom Riga, can fly to Vienna:\n- Day 2: Riga \u2192 Vienna (arrive day 2 for show)\n- Day 3: Vienna\nNow need to go to Helsinki by day 5.\nFrom Vienna to Riga:\n- Day 4: Vienna \u2192 Riga\n- Day 5: Riga \u2192 Helsinki\nAgain, arrives Helsinki day 5.\n\nThis seems unavoidable unless we start in Helsinki, but then can't be in Vienna for show.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with starting in Riga:\n- Day 1: Riga\n- Day 2: Riga \u2192 Vienna\n- Day 3: Vienna\n- Day 4: Vienna \u2192 Riga\n- Day 5: Riga \u2192 Helsinki\nNow in Helsinki day 5. Need 3 days in Helsinki:\n- Day 5-7: Helsinki\nThen wedding in Tallinn between day 7-11.\nFrom Helsinki, can fly to Tallinn directly:\n- Day 8: Helsinki \u2192 Tallinn (but wedding is day 7-11, so need to be there by day 7.\nWait, if in Helsinki day 5-7, then day 7 can be travel to Tallinn:\n- Day 7: Helsinki \u2192 Tallinn (counts as day in both)\nThen Tallinn wedding day 7-11:\n- Day 7-11: Tallinn (but need 5 days total in Tallinn, so up to day 11 is 5 days (7,8,9,10,11))\nThen from Tallinn, can fly to Dublin:\n- Day 12: Tallinn \u2192 Dublin\nDublin needs 5 days total, already have day 12:\n- Day 12-16: But only 15 days, so up to day 15:\nDay 12-15: Dublin (4 days), but need 5 total. So need one more day earlier.\nWait, total days in Dublin:\nCurrently:\n- Day 12-15: 4 days (12,13,14,15)\nNeed one more day earlier. Maybe adjust earlier stays.\n\nAlternative: from Tallinn, can go to Reykjavik:\nNeed 2 days in Reykjavik:\n- Day 12: Tallinn \u2192 Reykjavik\n- Day 13: Reykjavik\n- Day 14: Reykjavik \u2192 Dublin\n- Day 15: Dublin\nBut Dublin only gets 2 days (14,15), need 5.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe initial assumption is off.\n\nLet me try another approach: start in Reykjavik.\n\n**Start in Reykjavik:**\n- Day 1-2: Reykjavik (2 days)\nFrom Reykjavik, can fly to Vienna:\n- Day 3: Reykjavik \u2192 Vienna (but show is day 2-3, too late.\nNo good.\n\nStart in Helsinki:\n- Day 1: Helsinki\nFrom Helsinki, can fly to Vienna:\n- Day 2: Helsinki \u2192 Vienna (arrive day 2 for show)\n- Day 3: Vienna\nNow need to meet friends in Helsinki between day 3-5, but we're in Vienna on day 3.\nCan fly back:\n- Day 4: Vienna \u2192 Riga\n- Day 5: Riga \u2192 Helsinki\nNow in Helsinki day 5, friends between day 3-5, so day 5 is okay if they're there then.\n- Day 5-7: Helsinki (3 days total: day 5,6,7)\nThen to Tallinn for wedding day 7-11:\n- Day 8: Helsinki \u2192 Tallinn (but wedding starts day 7, so need to be there by day 7)\nSo day 7: Helsinki \u2192 Tallinn (counts as day in both)\n- Day 7-11: Tallinn (5 days: 7,8,9,10,11)\nThen from Tallinn, can fly to Dublin:\n- Day 12: Tallinn \u2192 Dublin\n- Day 12-15: Dublin (4 days), need 5 total. Missing one day.\nAlternatively, from Tallinn to Riga:\n- Day 12: Tallinn \u2192 Riga\nRiga needs 3 days:\n- Day 12-14: Riga\nThen to Dublin:\n- Day 15: Riga \u2192 Dublin\nBut Dublin only gets day 15, need 5. Not working.\n\nAlternative: from Tallinn to Reykjavik:\nBut Reykjavik already done at start.\n\nThis is getting convoluted. Maybe initial approach with starting in Riga is best, accepting that Helsinki friends are met on day 5.\n\nFinalizing starting in Riga:\n- Day 1: Riga\n- Day 2: Riga \u2192 Vienna\n- Day 3: Vienna\n- Day 4: Vienna \u2192 Riga\n- Day 5: Riga \u2192 Helsinki\n- Day 5-7: Helsinki\n- Day 7: Helsinki \u2192 Tallinn\n- Day 7-11: Tallinn\nNow need to fit Dublin (5 days) and Reykjavik (2 days).\nFrom Tallinn, can go to Dublin:\n- Day 12: Tallinn \u2192 Dublin\n- Day 12-15: Dublin (4 days), need 5. Missing one day.\nAlternatively, from Tallinn to Reykjavik:\n- Day 12: Tallinn \u2192 Reykjavik\n- Day 13: Reykjavik\n- Day 14: Reykjavik \u2192 Dublin\n- Day 15: Dublin\nDublin gets 2 days (14,15), need 5. Not enough.\n\nAlternative: adjust earlier stays. Maybe reduce Riga days.\nRiga needs 3 days: currently day 1, day 4, so need one more.\nWait, current Riga days:\n- Day 1: Riga\n- Day 4: Vienna \u2192 Riga\n- Day 5: Riga \u2192 Helsinki\nSo Riga has day 1 and 4, need one more. Maybe extend to day 6:\n- Day 5: Riga\n- Day 6: Riga \u2192 Helsinki\nThen Helsinki day 6-8\nTallinn day 8-12\nThen from Tallinn:\n- Day 13: Tallinn \u2192 Dublin\n- Day 13-15: Dublin (3 days), still missing 2.\n\nThis isn't adding up. Maybe initial constraints are too tight.\n\nAfter several iterations, here's a feasible itinerary:\n\n### Final Itinerary:\n1. **Day 1-2**: Dublin (2 days)\n   - Fly to Vienna on day 2 (arrive day 2 for show)\n2. **Day 2-3**: Vienna (2 days: day 2 arrival and day 3)\n3. **Day 4**: Vienna \u2192 Riga\n4. **Day 4-6**: Riga (3 days: day 4 arrival, day 5, day 6)\n5. **Day 7**: Riga \u2192 Helsinki\n6. **Day 7-9**: Helsinki (3 days: day 7 arrival, day 8, day 9)\n   - Meets friends between day 3-5? Not quite, but closest possible.\n7. **Day 10**: Helsinki \u2192 Tallinn\n8. **Day 10-14**: Tallinn (5 days: day 10 arrival to day 14)\n   - Wedding between day 7-11 is covered (day 10-11)\n9. **Day 15**: Tallinn \u2192 Dublin\n   - Dublin gets day 2, day 15 (only 2 days), but need 5. Not working.\n\nGiven the constraints, it's impossible to satisfy all stays perfectly. Here's the closest possible, prioritizing key constraints (Vienna show, Helsinki friends, Tallinn wedding):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Dublin\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-3\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-6\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-14\", \"place\": \"Tallinn\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15\", \"place\": \"Dublin\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n*Note: Dublin only gets 3 days (day 1,2,15), Reykjavik is missed due to tight constraints.* \n\nA fully compliant itinerary isn't possible without exceeding 15 days or missing some stays. Adjusting some stays or flight days might be necessary in practice.",
