You cannot visit Dublin because:\n   - The only direct flight to Dublin is from Riga\n   - You'd need to fly Riga\u2192Dublin\u2192Riga to include Dublin, but there's no direct flight back from Dublin to Riga (only Riga to Dublin is listed)\n   - This would require more days than available (12) to accommodate all stays\n2. The itinerary satisfies:\n   - 5 days in Riga (Day 1-5)\n   - Flight from Riga to Vilnius on Day 5 (counts for both cities)\n   - 7 days in Vilnius (Day 5-12, including the flight day)\n   - Total of 12 days (5 in Riga + 7 in Vilnius, with Day 5 counted twice)",
