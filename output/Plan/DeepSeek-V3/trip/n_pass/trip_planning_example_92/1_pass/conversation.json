You plan to stay in Vilnius for 7 days. You would like to visit Dublin for 2 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nDublin and Riga, from Riga to Vilnius.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

You cannot visit Dublin because:\n   - The only direct flight to Dublin is from Riga\n   - You'd need to fly Riga\u2192Dublin\u2192Riga to include Dublin, but there's no direct flight back from Dublin to Riga (only Riga to Dublin is listed)\n   - This would require more days than available (12) to accommodate all stays\n2. The itinerary satisfies:\n   - 5 days in Riga (Day 1-5)\n   - Flight from Riga to Vilnius on Day 5 (counts for both cities)\n   - 7 days in Vilnius (Day 5-12, including the flight day)\n   - Total of 12 days (5 in Riga + 7 in Vilnius, with Day 5 counted twice)"
