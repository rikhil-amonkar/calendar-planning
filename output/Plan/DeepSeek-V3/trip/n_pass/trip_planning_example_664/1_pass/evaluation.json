    "execution_output": "Alright, let's tackle this European city trip planning step by step. We have six cities to visit over 18 days, with specific stay durations and some time-bound events in certain cities. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Cities and Their Stay Durations:\n1. **Tallinn**: 2 days\n2. **Bucharest**: 4 days (with relatives between Day 1-4)\n3. **Seville**: 5 days (with friends between Day 8-12)\n4. **Stockholm**: 5 days\n5. **Munich**: 5 days (wedding between Day 4-8)\n6. **Milan**: 2 days\n\n### Direct Flight Connections:\n- Milan \u2194 Stockholm\n- Munich \u2194 Stockholm\n- Bucharest \u2194 Munich\n- Munich \u2194 Seville\n- Stockholm \u2194 Tallinn\n- Munich \u2194 Milan\n- Munich \u2194 Tallinn\n- Seville \u2194 Milan\n\n### Constraints:\n1. **Bucharest**: Must be visited first since relatives are between Day 1-4.\n   - So, Bucharest: Day 1-4 (4 days)\n2. **Munich Wedding**: Between Day 4-8.\n   - Since Bucharest ends on Day 4, and the wedding starts on Day 4, we must fly from Bucharest to Munich on Day 4.\n   - Munich: Day 4-8 (5 days, including Day 4)\n3. **Seville Friends**: Between Day 8-12.\n   - Munich ends on Day 8, so fly to Seville on Day 8.\n   - Seville: Day 8-12 (5 days, including Day 8)\n4. **Other Cities**:\n   - After Seville (ends Day 12), we have 6 days left (Days 13-18).\n   - We need to visit Stockholm (5 days), Tallinn (2 days), and Milan (2 days), totaling 9 days, but only 6 left. This suggests overlaps or that some visits are already partially covered.\n   - Wait, let's tally total days allocated so far:\n     - Bucharest: 4\n     - Munich: 5 (but overlaps with Bucharest's last day, so total unique days: 4 + 4 = 8)\n     - Seville: 5 (overlaps with Munich's last day, so total unique days: 8 + 4 = 12)\n     - Remaining days: 18 - 12 = 6 days.\n   - Need to fit Stockholm (5), Tallinn (2), Milan (2) into 6 days, meaning overlaps.\n   - Possible sequence:\n     - From Seville (ends Day 12), fly to Milan (direct flight exists).\n     - Milan: Day 12-13 (2 days, including Day 12)\n     - Then fly to Stockholm (direct flight exists).\n     - Stockholm: Day 13-17 (5 days, including Day 13)\n     - Then fly to Tallinn (direct flight exists).\n     - Tallinn: Day 17-18 (2 days, including Day 17)\n   - This sums up:\n     - Milan: 2 days (Day 12-13)\n     - Stockholm: 5 days (Day 13-17)\n     - Tallinn: 2 days (Day 17-18)\n     - Total unique days: 12 (previous) + 1 (Milan) + 4 (Stockholm) + 1 (Tallinn) = 18 days.\n\n### Verifying All Visits:\n- Bucharest: Day 1-4 (relatives between Day 1-4) \u2714\n- Munich: Day 4-8 (wedding between Day 4-8) \u2714\n- Seville: Day 8-12 (friends between Day 8-12) \u2714\n- Milan: Day 12-13 \u2714\n- Stockholm: Day 13-17 \u2714\n- Tallinn: Day 17-18 \u2714\n\n### Checking Flight Connections:\n- Bucharest \u2192 Munich: direct \u2714\n- Munich \u2192 Seville: direct \u2714\n- Seville \u2192 Milan: direct \u2714\n- Milan \u2192 Stockholm: direct \u2714\n- Stockholm \u2192 Tallinn: direct \u2714\n\nAll flights are direct as required.\n\n### Final Itinerary in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\",\n      \"place\": \"Bucharest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\",\n      \"place\": \"Munich\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 8-12\",\n      \"place\": \"Seville\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 12-13\",\n      \"place\": \"Milan\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 13-17\",\n      \"place\": \"Stockholm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 17-18\",\n      \"place\": \"Tallinn\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Day Counts:\n- **Bucharest (Day 1-4)**: 4 days (Day 1, 2, 3, 4)\n- **Munich (Day 4-8)**: Day 4 is counted for both Bucharest and Munich. So Munich is Day 4,5,6,7,8 (5 days)\n- **Seville (Day 8-12)**: Day 8 is counted for both Munich and Seville. Seville is Day 8,9,10,11,12 (5 days)\n- **Milan (Day 12-13)**: Day 12 is counted for both Seville and Milan. Milan is Day 12,13 (2 days)\n- **Stockholm (Day 13-17)**: Day 13 is counted for both Milan and Stockholm. Stockholm is Day 13,14,15,16,17 (5 days)\n- **Tallinn (Day 17-18)**: Day 17 is counted for both Stockholm and Tallinn. Tallinn is Day 17,18 (2 days)\n\nThis satisfies all the given constraints and ensures that each city is visited for the required number of days with direct flights between them.",
