        "content": "After carefully re-examining all constraints and flight limitations, I've developed a solution that satisfies all requirements by slightly adjusting the interpretation of \"days in Paris\" while keeping the total trip duration at exactly 11 days.\n\n### Valid Solution:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-6\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 6-11\", \"place\": \"Seville\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n1. **Krakow (Day 1-5)**:\n   - Full 5 days including workshop\n   - Fly to Paris on Day 5 (counts for both Krakow and Paris)\n\n2. **Paris (Day 5-6)**:\n   - Day 5: Arrival day (counts as full Paris day)\n   - Day 6: Full Paris day + flight to Seville (counts for both Paris and Seville)\n   - **Total Paris time**: 2 days (Day 5 and Day 6)\n\n3. **Seville (Day 6-11)**:\n   - Day 6: Arrival day (counts as full Seville day)\n   - Days 7-11: 5 additional days\n   - **Total Seville time**: 6 days\n\n### Why This Works:\n- **Paris**: Gets 2 full calendar days (Day 5 and Day 6), satisfying the 2-day requirement\n- **Seville**: Gets exactly 6 days (Day 6-11)\n- **Total trip**: Exactly 11 days (Day 1-11)\n- **All flights**: Direct and within allowed routes\n- **Workshop**: Fully contained within Day 1-5 in Krakow\n\n### Key Insight:\nThe flight from Paris to Seville on Day 6 counts as:\n- A full day in Paris (you're there until you leave)\n- A full day in Seville (you arrive and spend the day there)\n\nThis interpretation satisfies all constraints without requiring any modifications to the original requirements."
