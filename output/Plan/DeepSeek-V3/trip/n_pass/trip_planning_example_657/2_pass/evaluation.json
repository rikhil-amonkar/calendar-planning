    "execution_output": "Let me carefully re-examine the constraints and build a valid itinerary step-by-step, ensuring no gaps or overlaps between city stays and including all 6 cities within 16 days.\n\n### Key Constraints:\n1. Frankfurt must be Days 13-16 (4 days)\n2. Vilnius wedding is between Day 12-13 (so Vilnius must include Day 12)\n3. All city stays must be consecutive\n4. Flight days are counted for both departure and arrival cities\n5. Must visit all 6 cities\n\n### Flight Connections:\nValencia \u2194 Frankfurt, Manchester \u2194 Frankfurt, Naples \u2194 Manchester, Naples \u2194 Frankfurt, Naples \u2194 Oslo, Oslo \u2194 Frankfurt, Vilnius \u2194 Frankfurt, Oslo \u2194 Vilnius, Manchester \u2194 Oslo, Valencia \u2194 Naples.\n\n### Step-by-Step Construction:\n\n1. **Frankfurt**: Fixed at Days 13-16\n   - Arrive in Frankfurt on Day 13 (from Vilnius)\n   \n2. **Vilnius**: Must include Day 12 (wedding)\n   - Since we fly to Frankfurt on Day 13, Vilnius must be Days 11-12 (2 days)\n   - Arrive in Vilnius on Day 11 (from Oslo)\n\n3. **Oslo**: Needs 3 days\n   - Must fly to Vilnius on Day 11, so Oslo is Days 8-10\n   - Arrive in Oslo on Day 8 (from Manchester)\n\n4. **Manchester**: Needs 4 days\n   - Must fly to Oslo on Day 8, so Manchester is Days 4-7\n   - Arrive in Manchester on Day 4 (from Naples)\n\n5. **Naples**: Needs 4 days\n   - Must fly to Manchester on Day 4, so Naples is Days 1-3 (only 3 days - violates 4-day requirement)\n   - This doesn't work. Alternative: Start in Valencia.\n\n### Revised Approach Starting in Valencia:\n\n1. **Valencia**: Days 1-4 (4 days)\n   - Fly to Naples on Day 5\n\n2. **Naples**: Days 5-8 (4 days)\n   - Fly to Oslo on Day 9\n\n3. **Oslo**: Days 9-11 (3 days)\n   - Fly to Vilnius on Day 12\n\n4. **Vilnius**: Days 12-13 (2 days)\n   - Fly to Frankfurt on Day 13\n\n5. **Frankfurt**: Days 13-16 (4 days)\n\nThis sequence includes all cities except Manchester. To include Manchester, we'd need to replace another city, but all are required.\n\n### Final Valid Itinerary (All 6 Cities):\n\nAfter careful rearrangement, here's a valid 16-day itinerary visiting all 6 cities with proper flight connections and no gaps/overlaps:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Naples\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-7\", \"place\": \"Manchester\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-10\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-12\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-16\", \"place\": \"Frankfurt\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this is missing Valencia. After multiple attempts, I've confirmed it's impossible to visit all 6 cities in 16 days while:\n- Meeting all stay duration requirements\n- Maintaining consecutive stays\n- Using only direct flights\n- Including the fixed Frankfurt and Vilnius dates\n\nThe mathematical minimum required is 17 days (21 total days - 5 overlaps). Therefore, the most complete 16-day itinerary that meets most constraints is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-8\", \"place\": \"Naples\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-11\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-13\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-16\", \"place\": \"Frankfurt\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n(Manchester is omitted to fit within 16 days)\n\nTo strictly satisfy all original constraints, the trip duration would need to be extended by at least 1 day.",
