Remaining: 17 - 11 = 6 days.  \nCities left: Lisbon (4), Reykjavik (3), Santorini (3). Need 10 days but only have 6. Not feasible.\n\n**Alternative Option**: Brussels \u2192 Lisbon (Day 3)  \n- Lisbon: Day 3-6 (4 days)  \n- Then Lisbon \u2192 Venice (Day 6)  \n  - But Venice must include Days 5-7, so this is too late.

Lisbon \u2192 Reykjavik (Day 16)  \n   - Reykjavik: Day 16-17 (2 days)  \n\nThis is the closest possible, but Reykjavik is short by 1 day.

Reykjavik is slightly short, but all other requirements are met. If we must strictly satisfy all durations, we\u2019d need to drop one city or adjust stays further, but the problem requires visiting all 7.  \n\n### Alternative Strictly Valid Itinerary (If Reykjavik Can Be 2 Days):\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Brussels\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-5\", \"place\": \"London\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-7\", \"place\": \"Venice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-11\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-13\", \"place\": \"Santorini\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-16\", \"place\": \"Lisbon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-17\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nThis avoids gaps/overlaps and satisfies all fixed dates, though Reykjavik is slightly short. If this is unacceptable, please clarify which city\u2019s duration can be adjusted. Otherwise, this is the optimal solution."
