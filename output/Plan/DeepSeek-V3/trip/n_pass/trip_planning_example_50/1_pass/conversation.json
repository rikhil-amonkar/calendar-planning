You plan to stay in Munich for 3 days. You would like to visit Mykonos for 7 days.\n\nHere are the cities that have direct flights:\nMunich and Mykonos, from Vilnius to Munich.\n\nFind a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.\n\nPlease output the trip plan in the following JSON format:\n{\"itinerary\": [{\"day_range\": \"Day X-Y\", \"place\": \"<CITY>\"}]}. Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

        "content": "Here's the trip plan in the requested JSON format, adhering to the given constraints and flight connections:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\",\n      \"place\": \"Vilnius\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 4-7\",\n      \"place\": \"Munich\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 7-12\",\n      \"place\": \"Mykonos\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Vilnius (Days 1-4)**: You start in Vilnius and spend 4 full days there (Days 1, 2, 3, and 4). On Day 4, you fly to Munich. Day 4 counts for both Vilnius and Munich.\n2. **Munich (Days 4-7)**: You arrive in Munich on Day 4 and stay for 3 days (Days 4, 5, and 6). On Day 7, you fly to Mykonos. Day 7 counts for both Munich and Mykonos.\n3. **Mykonos (Days 7-12)**: You arrive in Mykonos on Day 7 and stay for 6 days (Days 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12). \n\nThis satisfies:\n- 4 days in Vilnius (Days 1-4),\n- 3 days in Munich (Days 4-6, with Day 4 counted for both Vilnius and Munich),\n- 6 days in Mykonos (Days 7-12, with Day 7 counted for both Munich and Mykonos). \n\nThe total is 12 days (4 + 3 + 6 - 1 overlap day = 12). \n\nNote: The original request for 7 days in Mykonos is not possible within 12 days while also spending 4 days in Vilnius and 3 days in Munich. The above plan maximizes time in Mykonos while fitting the other constraints. If you strictly need 7 days in Mykonos, the total trip would require 14 days (4 + 3 + 7 - 2 overlap days = 12). Let me know if you'd like an adjusted plan."
