Let me rework the itinerary to fix these issues while ensuring all constraints are met.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Mykonos must be first (Day 1-3)** due to the wedding.\n2. **Prague must include Day 7-9** for relatives.\n3. All city stays must meet the required days, accounting for flight days overlapping.\n4. No gaps or overlaps in the day ranges.\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n- Reduce Zurich's stay to fit other cities (but Zurich requires 5 days, so this isn't possible).\n- Alternatively, adjust the order to fit Valencia earlier.\n\n### Corrected Itinerary:\nHere\u2019s a feasible plan that avoids gaps and meets all constraints (though Valencia still cannot get 5 days without exceeding 22 days):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Zurich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-13\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},  // Flight from Prague to Riga on Day 9 (no gap)\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-15\", \"place\": \"Nice\"}, // Flight from Riga to Nice on Day 14\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-20\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"}, // Flight from Nice to Bucharest on Day 16\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21-22\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"}   // Flight from Bucharest to Valencia on Day 21\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Issues Remaining:\n1. **Valencia only gets 2 days** (needs 5). This is unavoidable without exceeding 22 days or violating other constraints.\n2. **Nice gets 2 days** (correct), but the flight from Riga to Nice on Day 14 means:\n   - Riga ends on Day 13 (5 days: 9-13).\n   - Nice starts on Day 14 (flight day) and ends on Day 15 (2 days total).\n\n### Why This Is the Best Possible:\n- Total days used: 22 (Mykonos: 3, Zurich: 5, Prague: 3, Riga: 5, Nice: 2, Bucharest: 5, Valencia: 2).\n- All flights are direct and respect the constraints.\n- The only violation is Valencia's duration, but this is mathematically unavoidable given the other requirements.\n\n### Alternative (Drop One City):\nIf you\u2019re open to dropping one city (e.g., Nice), here\u2019s a 22-day plan that fits all other constraints:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Zurich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-13\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-18\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-22\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"}  // Valencia gets 4 days (still short)\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe original problem is unsolvable as stated because:\n- The sum of required days (28) exceeds the available days (22) even with overlapping flight days.\n- Valencia cannot get 5 days without violating other constraints.\n\n**Final Answer (Closest Possible):**\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Zurich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-13\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-15\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-20\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21-22\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n*Note: Valencia is short by 3 days. To fully satisfy all constraints, consider either:*\n1. *Extending the trip beyond 22 days, or*\n2. *Reducing the stay in one city (e.g., Zurich or Riga).*"
