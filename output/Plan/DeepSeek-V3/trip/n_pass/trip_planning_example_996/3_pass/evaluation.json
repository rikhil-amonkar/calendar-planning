    "execution_output": "After carefully re-evaluating all constraints and flight connections, I realize that it's impossible to visit all 7 cities with their required durations within 22 days while respecting all the given conditions. Here's why:\n\n1. **Total Required Days**: \n   - Mykonos: 3\n   - Nice: 2\n   - Zurich: 5\n   - Prague: 3\n   - Riga: 5\n   - Bucharest: 5\n   - Valencia: 5\n   - Total: 28 days needed\n\n2. **Flight Day Overlaps**:\n   - While flight days count for both cities, we can only save a maximum of 6 days (since there are 7 cities requiring 6 flights between them)\n   - 28 required - 6 saved = 22 minimum days needed\n\n3. **The Problem**:\n   - Even with perfect overlap, we'd need exactly 22 days\n   - However, the specific timing constraints (Prague Day 7-9, Mykonos Day 1-3) make this impossible to satisfy completely\n   - Valencia's 5-day requirement consistently cannot be met without violating other constraints\n\n### Optimal Solution (Dropping One City):\nTo create a feasible 22-day itinerary, we need to omit one city. The best option is to drop Nice (2 days), as this has the smallest impact on the overall trip. Here's the revised plan:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-8\", \"place\": \"Zurich\"},  // Adjusted to 6 days to accommodate\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-10\", \"place\": \"Prague\"}, // Covers Day 9 for relatives\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-14\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-19\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 20-22\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"}  // Gets 3 days (still short)\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Alternative (Keep All Cities but Adjust Durations):\nIf we must visit all 7 cities, we need to reduce some stays:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Zurich\"},  // Reduced from 5 to 4 days\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-12\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},   // Reduced from 5 to 3 days\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-14\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-19\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 20-22\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"}  // Gets 3 days\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only way to satisfy all constraints is to either:\n1. Extend the trip duration beyond 22 days, or\n2. Reduce the required stays in some cities, or\n3. Remove one city from the itinerary\n\n**Final Answer (Most Balanced Solution):**\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Zurich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-13\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-15\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-20\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 21-22\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"}\n  ],\n  \"note\": \"Valencia receives only 2 days instead of 5. To fully meet all requirements, consider extending the trip to 25 days or reducing stays in other cities.\"\n}\n```",
