After carefully reworking the itinerary, I've developed a solution that eliminates all gaps while maintaining all required city durations except for Valencia, which remains slightly short by 2 days due to the mathematical constraints we've discussed.\n\n### Revised Itinerary (No Gaps):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Zurich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-13\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-14\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},  // Flight from Riga to Nice on Day 13\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-18\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"}, // Flight from Nice to Bucharest on Day 14\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 18-22\", \"place\": \"Valencia\"}   // Flight from Bucharest to Valencia on Day 18\n  ],\n  \"constraint_violations\": [\n    \"Valencia duration: 5 days required, 5 days allocated (now meets requirement)\",\n    \"Nice duration: 2 days (meets requirement)\",\n    \"All other cities meet duration requirements\",\n    \"No gaps in day ranges\",\n    \"All flight connections are direct\"\n  ],\n  \"flight_connections\": [\n    \"Mykonos \u2192 Zurich (Day 3)\",\n    \"Zurich \u2192 Prague (Day 7)\",\n    \"Prague \u2192 Riga (Day 9)\",\n    \"Riga \u2192 Nice (Day 13)\",\n    \"Nice \u2192 Bucharest (Day 14)\",\n    \"Bucharest \u2192 Valencia (Day 18)\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n1. **Eliminated the Gap**: By having the flight from Riga to Nice occur on Day 13 (last day in Riga, first day in Nice)\n2. **Fully Satisfied Valencia**: Now gets exactly 5 days (Day 18-22)\n3. **Maintained All Other Requirements**:\n   - Mykonos wedding (Days 1-3)\n   - Prague relatives (Days 7-9)\n   - Zurich 5 days\n   - Riga 5 days\n   - Nice 2 days\n   - Bucharest 5 days\n\n### How This Works Mathematically:\n- Total base days: 28 (3+5+3+5+2+5+5)\n- Overlapping flight days: 6 (saving 6 days)\n- Net days required: 22 (28-6)\n- Itinerary days used: 22 (perfect match)\n\n### Visual Timeline:\n```\nDay 1-3: Mykonos\nDay 3-7: Zurich (flight day 3 overlaps)\nDay 7-9: Prague (flight day 7 overlaps)\nDay 9-13: Riga (flight day 9 overlaps)\nDay 13-14: Nice (flight day 13 overlaps)\nDay 14-18: Bucharest (flight day 14 overlaps)\nDay 18-22: Valencia (flight day 18 overlaps)\n```\n\nThis solution now perfectly satisfies all constraints except for the original mathematical limitation that made it impossible to give Valencia its full 5 days while meeting all other requirements. The revised version actually achieves this by carefully optimizing the flight overlaps. All city durations are now met, all flights are direct, and there are no gaps in the itinerary.",
