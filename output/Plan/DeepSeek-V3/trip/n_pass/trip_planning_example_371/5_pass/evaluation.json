Here's the final valid plan:\n\n### Correct Itinerary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\",\n      \"place\": \"Vienna\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 2-4\",\n      \"place\": \"Nice\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\",\n      \"place\": \"Stockholm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 8-9\",\n      \"place\": \"Split\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Detailed Verification:\n\n1. **Vienna (Day 1-2)**:\n   - Day 1: Full day in Vienna (workshop)\n   - Day 2: Morning in Vienna, fly to Nice in evening\n   - Counts as 2 Vienna days (correct)\n\n2. **Nice (Day 2-4)**:\n   - Day 2: Arrive in Nice evening\n   - Day 3: Full day in Nice\n   - Day 4: Morning in Nice, fly to Stockholm evening\n   - Counts as 2 Nice days (Day 2 evening + Day 3 full day = 2 days) - correct\n\n3. **Stockholm (Day 4-8)**:\n   - Day 4: Arrive Stockholm evening\n   - Days 5,6,7: Full days in Stockholm\n   - Day 8: Morning in Stockholm, fly to Split evening\n   - Counts as 5 Stockholm days (4,5,6,7,8 - correct)\n\n4. **Split (Day 8-9)**:\n   - Day 8: Arrive Split evening\n   - Day 9: Conference day\n   - Counts as 2 Split days (but we need 3) - this is the issue\n\n### Final Correct Solution:\n\nAfter identifying the Split day count issue, here's the corrected itinerary that satisfies ALL constraints:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\",\n      \"place\": \"Vienna\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 2-3\",\n      \"place\": \"Nice\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\",\n      \"place\": \"Stockholm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\",\n      \"place\": \"Split\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Why This Works:\n\n1. **Vienna (Day 1-2)**:\n   - 2 days (correct)\n   - Workshop between Day 1-2 (satisfied)\n\n2. **Nice (Day 2-3)**:\n   - Day 2: Arrive evening (counts as 1 day)\n   - Day 3: Full day (counts as 1 day)\n   - Total: 2 days (correct)\n\n3. **Stockholm (Day 3-7)**:\n   - Day 3: Arrive evening (counts as 1 day)\n   - Days 4,5,6: Full days (3 days)\n   - Day 7: Morning (counts as 1 day)\n   - Total: 5 days (correct)\n\n4. **Split (Day 7-9)**:\n   - Day 7: Arrive evening (counts as 1 day)\n   - Day 8: Full day (1 day)\n   - Day 9: Conference day (1 day)\n   - Total: 3 days (correct)\n\n### Flight Connections:\n- Day 2: Vienna \u2192 Nice (direct)\n- Day 3: Nice \u2192 Stockholm (direct)\n- Day 7: Stockholm \u2192 Split (direct)\n\nAll constraints are perfectly satisfied:\n- Vienna: 2 days\n- Nice: 2 days\n- Stockholm: 5 days\n- Split: 3 days (conference on Day 7 and 9)\n- All flights direct\n- Total trip: 9 days\n\nThis is the definitive solution that meets all requirements.",
