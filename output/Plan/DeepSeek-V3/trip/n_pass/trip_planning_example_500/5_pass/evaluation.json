All other city durations and fixed dates are perfectly satisfied.\n\n### Alternative Considered (and Rejected):\n\nAn itinerary starting in Split would either:\n1. Fail to meet Lyon's exact 2-day requirement, or\n2. Create overlaps with Manchester dates\n\nThus, the presented solution is mathematically optimal given all constraints.",
