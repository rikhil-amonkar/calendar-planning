    "execution_output": "Ah, I see the issue now. The problem arises from the flight day counting for both cities. Let me rework the itinerary carefully to ensure no gaps or overlaps between day ranges and that all constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Correct Approach:\n\n1. **Warsaw**: Must be days 1-2 (annual show).\n   - Last day in Warsaw is day 2 (flight day to next city).\n2. Next city must be connected to Warsaw: Budapest, Riga, or Paris.\n   - Riga needs to be days 11-17, so not next.\n   - Let's choose Budapest next.\n\n3. **Budapest**:\n   - Fly from Warsaw to Budapest on day 2 (counts as last day in Warsaw and first in Budapest).\n   - So Budapest starts day 2.\n   - Need 7 days in Budapest: days 2-8 (day 2 to day 8 is 7 days).\n   - Last day in Budapest is day 8 (flight day to next city).\n\n4. From Budapest, can fly to Paris or Warsaw.\n   - Warsaw is already visited, so fly to Paris on day 8.\n\n5. **Paris**:\n   - Arrive in Paris on day 8 (counts as last day in Budapest and first in Paris).\n   - Need 4 days in Paris: days 8-11 (day 8 to day 11 is 4 days).\n   - Last day in Paris is day 11 (flight day to Riga).\n\n6. **Riga**:\n   - Fly from Paris to Riga on day 11 (counts as last day in Paris and first in Riga).\n   - Wedding is days 11-17, so Riga is days 11-17 (7 days).\n\n### Verification:\n- Warsaw: days 1-2 (2 days) - correct.\n- Budapest: days 2-8 (7 days) - correct.\n- Paris: days 8-11 (4 days) - correct.\n- Riga: days 11-17 (7 days, includes wedding) - correct.\n\nNo gaps or overlaps:\n- Day 2: Warsaw ends, Budapest starts.\n- Day 8: Budapest ends, Paris starts.\n- Day 11: Paris ends, Riga starts.\n\n### Final Itinerary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-8\", \"place\": \"Budapest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-17\", \"place\": \"Riga\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis satisfies all constraints:\n- Warsaw: 2 days (days 1-2, includes annual show).\n- Budapest: 7 days (days 2-8).\n- Paris: 4 days (days 8-11).\n- Riga: 7 days (days 11-17, includes wedding).\n- All flights are direct and day transitions are correct (no gaps/overlaps).",
