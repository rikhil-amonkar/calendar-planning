Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this trip planning problem step by step. I'll start by listing out all the requirements and then try to fit them into the 17-day itinerary while respecting the flight connections available.\n\n### Given Information:\n\n1. **Total Trip Duration**: 17 days.\n2. **Cities to Visit**:\n   - Riga: 7 days (must include the wedding between day 11 and day 17).\n   - Budapest: 7 days.\n   - Paris: 4 days.\n   - Warsaw: 2 days (must include day 1 to day 2 for the annual show).\n3. **Flight Connections** (only direct flights allowed):\n   - Warsaw \u2194 Budapest\n   - Warsaw \u2194 Riga\n   - Budapest \u2194 Paris\n   - Warsaw \u2194 Paris\n   - Paris \u2194 Riga\n\n### Constraints:\n\n- The wedding in Riga is between day 11 and day 17, so Riga must be visited during this period.\n- The annual show in Warsaw is on day 1 to day 2, so Warsaw must be the first city visited.\n- Flight days count for both the departing and arriving cities. For example, if you fly from Warsaw to Budapest on day 3, day 3 is counted in both Warsaw and Budapest's stay durations.\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Start in Warsaw**: Since the show is on day 1-2, we must be in Warsaw from day 1 to day 2.\n   - Warsaw: Day 1-2 (2 days).\n\n2. **Next City from Warsaw**: From Warsaw, we can fly directly to Budapest, Riga, or Paris.\n   - Let's consider options:\n     - Warsaw \u2192 Budapest\n     - Warsaw \u2192 Riga\n     - Warsaw \u2192 Paris\n\n3. **Riga's Wedding Constraint**: Riga must be visited between day 11-17 for the wedding. Since we're starting in Warsaw, and we have to fit in Budapest and Paris, it might make sense to visit Riga towards the end.\n\n4. **Budapest and Paris**: Need to allocate 7 days for Budapest and 4 days for Paris. Let's see possible sequences.\n\n### Possible Itinerary:\n\nLet's try this sequence: Warsaw \u2192 Budapest \u2192 Paris \u2192 Riga.\n\n- **Warsaw**: Day 1-2 (2 days).\n  - On day 3, fly to Budapest. Day 3 counts for both Warsaw and Budapest.\n  - But Warsaw already has day 1-2 (2 days), so adding day 3 would make it 3 days, but we only need 2 days in Warsaw. So this doesn't work because we'd overstay in Warsaw.\n\nAlternative: Since we need exactly 2 days in Warsaw, the flight must be on day 2 or day 3.\n\nWait, no: If we're in Warsaw day 1-2, then the flight is on day 2 to another city, meaning day 2 is counted for both Warsaw and the next city.\n\nBut then Warsaw is day 1-2 (but day 2 is also the first day in the next city), so Warsaw is effectively day 1 (arrival) and day 2 (departure), which is 2 days (day 1 and day 2).\n\nSimilarly, the next city starts on day 2.\n\nLet me rephrase the counting:\n\n- Arrive in Warsaw on day 1: day 1 counts for Warsaw.\n- Stay in Warsaw on day 2: day 2 counts for Warsaw.\n- Fly out on day 2 to another city: day 2 also counts for the next city.\nSo Warsaw is day 1-2 (2 days), and the next city starts on day 2.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Warsaw: Day 1-2 (2 days).\n   - On day 2, fly to next city (Budapest, Riga, or Paris).\n\nOption 1: Fly to Budapest on day 2.\n- Budapest starts on day 2.\n- Need 7 days in Budapest: day 2 to day 8 (since day 2 to day 8 is 7 days: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8).\n- On day 8, fly to next city. From Budapest, can fly to Paris or Warsaw.\n   - Don't go back to Warsaw, so fly to Paris on day 8.\n- Paris starts on day 8.\n- Need 4 days in Paris: day 8 to day 11 (8,9,10,11).\n- On day 11, fly to Riga.\n- Riga starts on day 11.\n- Wedding is between day 11-17, which fits.\n- Need 7 days in Riga: day 11 to day 17 (11,12,13,14,15,16,17).\n- Trip ends on day 17.\n\nLet's check the days:\n\n- Warsaw: 1-2 (2 days).\n- Budapest: 2-8 (7 days). Wait, day 2 is shared with Warsaw, so Budapest is from day 2 to day 8, which is 7 days (2,3,4,5,6,7,8).\n- Paris: 8-11 (4 days). Day 8 is shared with Budapest, so Paris is 8,9,10,11.\n- Riga: 11-17 (7 days). Day 11 is shared with Paris, so Riga is 11,12,13,14,15,16,17.\n\nTotal days: 17.\n\nThis seems to fit all constraints.\n\n### Verify Flight Connections:\n\n- Warsaw to Budapest: direct flight available.\n- Budapest to Paris: direct flight available.\n- Paris to Riga: direct flight available.\n\nAll flight connections are valid.\n\n### Alternative Sequences:\n\nJust to ensure this is the only possible sequence, let's check another option: Warsaw \u2192 Paris \u2192 Budapest \u2192 Riga.\n\n1. Warsaw: 1-2.\n2. Fly to Paris on day 2.\n   - Paris: 2-6 (need 4 days: 2,3,4,5).\n3. Fly to Budapest on day 6.\n   - Budapest: 6-13 (7 days: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12).\n4. Fly to Riga on day 13.\n   - Riga: 13-17 (5 days), but need 7 days. Doesn't work.\n\nAnother option: Warsaw \u2192 Riga \u2192 ... but wedding is between day 11-17, and we're starting, so Riga would be too early. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo the first sequence seems correct.\n\n### Final Itinerary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-8\", \"place\": \"Budapest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-17\", \"place\": \"Riga\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Day Counts:\n\n- **Warsaw (Day 1-2)**:\n  - Day 1: Arrive in Warsaw.\n  - Day 2: Stay in Warsaw, then fly to Budapest in the evening (day counts for both).\n  - Total in Warsaw: 2 days (1, 2).\n\n- **Budapest (Day 2-8)**:\n  - Day 2: Arrive from Warsaw.\n  - Days 3-7: Stay in Budapest.\n  - Day 8: Stay in Budapest, then fly to Paris in the evening.\n  - Total in Budapest: 7 days (2,3,4,5,6,7,8).\n\n- **Paris (Day 8-11)**:\n  - Day 8: Arrive from Budapest.\n  - Days 9-10: Stay in Paris.\n  - Day 11: Stay in Paris, then fly to Riga in the evening.\n  - Total in Paris: 4 days (8,9,10,11).\n\n- **Riga (Day 11-17)**:\n  - Day 11: Arrive from Paris.\n  - Days 12-17: Stay in Riga (wedding is within this period).\n  - Total in Riga: 7 days (11,12,13,14,15,16,17).\n\nAll durations match the requirements, and all flights are direct as per the given connections."
