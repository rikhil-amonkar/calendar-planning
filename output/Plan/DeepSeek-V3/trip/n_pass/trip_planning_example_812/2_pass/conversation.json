We have seven cities to visit over 20 days, with specific durations and some fixed dates for certain activities. Additionally, we have a list of direct flight connections between these cities. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Cities and Required Stays:\n1. **Porto**: 3 days (Workshop Day 1-3)\n2. **Paris**: 5 days\n3. **Florence**: 3 days\n4. **Vienna**: 2 days (Relatives Day 19-20)\n5. **Munich**: 5 days\n6. **Nice**: 5 days\n7. **Warsaw**: 3 days (Wedding Day 13-15)\n\n### Direct Flight Connections:\nLet's list them for clarity:\n- Florence \u2194 Vienna\n- Paris \u2194 Warsaw\n- Munich \u2194 Vienna\n- Porto \u2194 Vienna\n- Warsaw \u2194 Vienna\n- Florence \u2192 Munich (one-way?)\n- Munich \u2194 Warsaw\n- Munich \u2194 Nice\n- Paris \u2194 Florence\n- Warsaw \u2194 Nice\n- Porto \u2194 Munich\n- Porto \u2194 Nice\n- Paris \u2194 Vienna\n- Nice \u2194 Vienna\n- Porto \u2194 Paris\n- Paris \u2194 Nice\n- Paris \u2194 Munich\n- Porto \u2194 Warsaw\n\n### Fixed Events:\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3 (Workshop)\n2. **Warsaw**: Day 13-15 (Wedding)\n3. **Vienna**: Day 19-20 (Relatives)\n\n### Approach:\n- Start in Porto (Day 1-3).\n- After Porto, we need to fly to another city. Possible direct flights from Porto: Vienna, Munich, Nice, Paris, Warsaw.\n- Next, plan the sequence ensuring we can reach all cities with their required stays, considering the fixed events.\n- Ensure that the Vienna visit is at the end (Day 19-20), and Warsaw is on Day 13-15.\n\n### Possible Sequence:\nGiven that Vienna is at the end, let's work backwards from Day 20.\n\n- Day 19-20: Vienna\n  - Before Vienna, we must be in a city that has a direct flight to Vienna. Possible: Florence, Munich, Porto, Warsaw, Paris, Nice.\n  - Since Vienna is last, the city before must connect to Vienna and its stay must end on Day 18.\n\nLooking at the wedding in Warsaw on Day 13-15:\n- Warsaw is Day 13-15.\n- After Warsaw (Day 16 onwards), where can we go? Direct flights from Warsaw: Paris, Vienna, Munich, Nice.\n  - Vienna is at the end, so after Warsaw, possible: Paris, Munich, Nice.\n  \nSimilarly, before Warsaw (Day 12), we must come from a city that connects to Warsaw.\n\nLet's try to build the itinerary step by step.\n\n### Building the Itinerary:\n\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3 (Workshop)\n   - Next flight on Day 3 to another city. Possible: Vienna, Munich, Nice, Paris, Warsaw.\n   - Let's choose Paris (since Paris has many connections and needs 5 days).\n   \n2. **Paris**: Day 3-8 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7,8? Wait, Day 3 is counted for both Porto and Paris, so Paris starts on Day 3.\n   - Porto: Day 1-3 (3 days: 1,2,3)\n   - Paris: Day 3-7 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7)\n   - Next flight on Day 7 from Paris. Possible connections: Warsaw, Florence, Vienna, Munich, Nice.\n   - Let's go to Florence (Paris-Florence is direct).\n\n3. **Florence**: Day 7-10 (3 days: 7,8,9,10? Wait, Day 7 is arrival, so:\n   - Florence: Day 7-9 (3 days: 7,8,9)\n   - Next flight on Day 9. From Florence: Vienna, Munich (one-way to Munich).\n   - Let's go to Munich (Florence to Munich is direct).\n\n4. **Munich**: Day 9-14 (5 days: 9,10,11,12,13)\n   - But Warsaw wedding is Day 13-15, so we need to be in Warsaw by Day 13.\n   - So Munich can be Day 9-12 (4 days), then fly to Warsaw on Day 13.\n   - But Munich needs 5 days, so adjust:\n     - Munich: Day 9-13 (5 days: 9,10,11,12,13)\n     - Then fly to Warsaw on Day 13, but Warsaw starts on Day 13, so overlap.\n     - So Warsaw: Day 13-15 (3 days: 13,14,15)\n     - Then from Warsaw, where to go? Options: Paris, Vienna, Munich, Nice.\n     - Vienna is at the end, so not yet. Maybe Nice.\n\n5. **Nice**: Day 15-20 (But Vienna is Day 19-20, so Nice can be Day 15-18 (4 days), then Vienna Day 19-20.\n   - But Nice needs 5 days, so this doesn't work.\n   - Alternative: After Warsaw, go to Munich.\n     - But Munich is already done.\n   - Or go to Paris, but Paris is done.\n   - Maybe adjust earlier steps.\n\nAlternative approach after Florence:\n\nFrom Florence (Day 7-9), go to Vienna (Day 9-11), but Vienna is supposed to be at the end. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother try:\n\nAfter Paris (Day 3-7), go to Nice (Paris-Nice is direct).\n- Nice: Day 7-12 (5 days: 7,8,9,10,11,12? 7 is arrival, so:\n  - Nice: Day 7-11 (5 days: 7,8,9,10,11)\n  - Next flight on Day 11. From Nice: Vienna, Munich, Paris, Warsaw.\n  - Go to Warsaw for wedding Day 13-15, but need to arrive by Day 13.\n  - So from Nice on Day 11, can go to Warsaw (Nice-Warsaw is direct), arriving Day 11.\n  - Warsaw: Day 11-14 (but wedding is Day 13-15), so:\n    - Warsaw: Day 11-15 (5 days, but needs only 3). Doesn't fit.\n  - Maybe Warsaw: Day 13-15, so before that, stay somewhere else.\n    - From Nice Day 11, go to Munich (Nice-Munich is direct).\n    - Munich: Day 11-16 (5 days), but overlaps with Warsaw wedding.\n    - Not working.\n\nLet me try another initial path after Porto.\n\nAlternative Start:\n\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3\n2. Fly to Munich on Day 3 (Porto-Munich is direct).\n   - Munich: Day 3-8 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7,8? 3 is arrival, so:\n     - Munich: Day 3-7 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7)\n   - Next flight on Day 7. From Munich: Vienna, Warsaw, Nice, Florence.\n   - Go to Florence (Munich-Florence is direct).\n3. **Florence**: Day 7-10 (3 days: 7,8,9)\n   - Next flight on Day 9. From Florence: Vienna, Munich.\n   - Go to Vienna (Florence-Vienna is direct).\n   - But Vienna is supposed to be at the end. Not fitting.\n   - Alternative from Florence on Day 9: Munich (already done), so stuck.\n\nNot working. Let's try another path.\n\nAnother Attempt:\n\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3\n2. Fly to Paris on Day 3 (Porto-Paris is direct).\n   - Paris: Day 3-8 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7)\n   - Next flight on Day 7. From Paris: Warsaw, Florence, Vienna, Munich, Nice.\n   - Go to Nice (Paris-Nice is direct).\n3. **Nice**: Day 7-12 (5 days: 7,8,9,10,11)\n   - Next flight on Day 11. From Nice: Vienna, Munich, Paris, Warsaw.\n   - Go to Warsaw for wedding Day 13-15.\n     - Nice-Warsaw is direct, arrive Day 11.\n     - Warsaw: Day 11-14 (but wedding is Day 13-15), so:\n       - Warsaw: Day 11-15 (5 days, but need only 3). Overstay.\n   - Alternative: From Nice on Day 11, go to Munich (Nice-Munich is direct).\n     - Munich: Day 11-16 (5 days: 11,12,13,14,15)\n     - But wedding is in Warsaw on Day 13-15, so conflict.\n   - Not working.\n\nFinal Attempt:\n\nLet's try to have Vienna just before the end, and adjust other stays.\n\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3\n2. Fly to Warsaw on Day 3 (Porto-Warsaw is direct).\n   - Warsaw: Day 3-6 (but wedding is Day 13-15), so this doesn't fit.\n   - Cannot start with Warsaw.\n\nSeems challenging. Maybe this sequence:\n\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3\n2. Fly to Munich on Day 3.\n   - Munich: Day 3-8 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7)\n3. Fly to Warsaw on Day 7 (Munich-Warsaw is direct).\n   - Warsaw: Day 7-10 (but wedding is Day 13-15), so adjust:\n     - Warsaw: Day 13-15, so need to fill before.\n   - Not working.\n\nAfter several attempts, here's a feasible sequence:\n\n### Final Itinerary:\n\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3 (Workshop)\n   - Fly to Paris on Day 3.\n2. **Paris**: Day 3-7 (5 days)\n   - Fly to Florence on Day 7.\n3. **Florence**: Day 7-10 (3 days)\n   - Fly to Munich on Day 10.\n4. **Munich**: Day 10-15 (5 days)\n   - Fly to Warsaw on Day 15 (but wedding is Day 13-15). Doesn't fit.\n   \nAlternative:\n\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3\n2. **Paris**: Day 3-7\n3. **Florence**: Day 7-10\n4. **Munich**: Day 10-15\n   - On Day 13, from Munich to Warsaw for wedding.\n   - So Munich: Day 10-13 (4 days), then Warsaw: Day 13-15 (3 days).\n   - Then from Warsaw, fly to Nice on Day 15.\n5. **Nice**: Day 15-19 (5 days)\n   - Fly to Vienna on Day 19.\n6. **Vienna**: Day 19-20\n\nThis fits all requirements.\n\n### JSON Itinerary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-10\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-13\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- Porto: Day 1-3 (3 days) - Workshop Day 1-3 \u2714\n- Paris: Day 3-7 (5 days) \u2714\n- Florence: Day 7-10 (3 days) \u2714\n- Munich: Day 10-13 (4 days) - Needs 5, so adjust to Day 10-14 (5 days), then Warsaw Day 14-16 (3 days), but wedding is Day 13-15. Conflict.\n  \nAdjust Munich to Day 10-14 (5 days), then Warsaw Day 14-16 (3 days), but wedding is Day 13-15. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative: Munich Day 10-14 (5 days), but need to be in Warsaw by Day 13. So overlap:\n\nMunich: Day 10-13 (4 days), fly to Warsaw on Day 13, Warsaw: Day 13-15 (3 days), then Nice: Day 15-19 (5 days), Vienna: Day 19-20.\n\nMunich gets only 4 days, needs 5. Not perfect.\n\nBest possible seems to be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-10\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-15\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-17\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nBut wedding is Day 13-15, not matching Warsaw stay.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the initial JSON is the closest fit, accepting Munich is slightly short by 1 day due to constraints. Alternatively, adjust other stays to fit Munich's 5 days, but may overstay elsewhere.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-10\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-13\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n*Note: Munich is 4 days here (Day 10-13), which is 1 day short of the required 5. Given the constraints, this seems unavoidable while meeting all fixed events.*"

Not perfect.\n\nBest possible seems to be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-10\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-15\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-17\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nBut wedding is Day 13-15, not matching Warsaw stay.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the initial JSON is the closest fit, accepting Munich is slightly short by 1 day due to constraints. Alternatively, adjust other stays to fit Munich's 5 days, but may overstay elsewhere.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-10\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-13\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n*Note: Munich is 4 days here (Day 10-13), which is 1 day short of the required 5. Given the constraints, this seems unavoidable while meeting all fixed events.*\nThe following constraints were violated:\n\n- Must stay in Florence for exactly 3 days\n\nPlease revise your plan to address these issues.\n\nPlease revise your solution to satisfy these constraints."

        "content": "Let me carefully re-examine the constraints and find a way to satisfy all requirements, including staying exactly 3 days in Florence and 5 days in Munich.\n\n### Key Constraints:\n1. **Porto**: 3 days (Day 1-3)\n2. **Paris**: 5 days\n3. **Florence**: 3 days\n4. **Munich**: 5 days\n5. **Warsaw**: 3 days (Wedding Day 13-15)\n6. **Nice**: 5 days\n7. **Vienna**: 2 days (Day 19-20)\n8. Direct flights must connect consecutive cities.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n- Start in Porto (Day 1-3).\n- After Porto, fly to a city connected to Porto (Paris, Munich, Nice, Vienna, Warsaw).\n- Ensure Warsaw is visited on Day 13-15.\n- Ensure Vienna is last (Day 19-20).\n- Allocate exact required days for each city.\n\n### Step-by-Step Itinerary:\n\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3 (Workshop)\n   - Fly to Paris on Day 3 (Porto-Paris is direct).\n\n2. **Paris**: Day 3-8 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7)\n   - Fly to Florence on Day 8 (Paris-Florence is direct).\n\n3. **Florence**: Day 8-11 (3 days: 8,9,10)\n   - Fly to Munich on Day 11 (Florence-Munich is direct).\n\n4. **Munich**: Day 11-16 (5 days: 11,12,13,14,15)\n   - On Day 13, fly to Warsaw (Munich-Warsaw is direct).\n   - **Note**: Day 13 is counted for both Munich and Warsaw.\n     - Munich: Day 11-13 (3 days: 11,12,13)\n     - Warsaw: Day 13-16 (4 days: 13,14,15,16)\n     - But wedding is Day 13-15, so Warsaw is Day 13-15 (3 days).\n     - This leaves Munich short by 2 days (only 3 days instead of 5).\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another path:\n\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3\n2. Fly to Munich on Day 3 (Porto-Munich is direct).\n   - **Munich**: Day 3-8 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7)\n   - Fly to Florence on Day 8 (Munich-Florence is direct).\n\n3. **Florence**: Day 8-11 (3 days: 8,9,10)\n   - Fly to Paris on Day 11 (Florence-Paris is direct).\n\n4. **Paris**: Day 11-16 (5 days: 11,12,13,14,15)\n   - On Day 13, fly to Warsaw (Paris-Warsaw is direct).\n     - Paris: Day 11-13 (3 days: 11,12,13)\n     - Warsaw: Day 13-16 (4 days: 13,14,15,16)\n     - Wedding is Day 13-15, so Warsaw is Day 13-15 (3 days).\n     - Then fly to Nice on Day 16 (Warsaw-Nice is direct).\n\n5. **Nice**: Day 16-21 (but only 20 days), so:\n   - Nice: Day 16-20 (5 days: 16,17,18,19,20)\n   - Fly to Vienna on Day 20 (Nice-Vienna is direct).\n     - Vienna: Day 20-21 (but trip ends on Day 20), so Vienna is only Day 20 (1 day).\n\nThis doesn't satisfy Vienna's 2-day requirement.\n\n### Correct Itinerary:\n\nAfter several iterations, here's a valid sequence:\n\n1. **Porto**: Day 1-3\n2. Fly to Paris on Day 3 (Porto-Paris).\n   - **Paris**: Day 3-8 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7)\n   - Fly to Florence on Day 8 (Paris-Florence).\n\n3. **Florence**: Day 8-11 (3 days: 8,9,10)\n   - Fly to Munich on Day 11 (Florence-Munich).\n\n4. **Munich**: Day 11-16 (5 days: 11,12,13,14,15)\n   - On Day 13, fly to Warsaw (Munich-Warsaw).\n     - **Munich**: Day 11-13 (3 days: 11,12,13)\n     - **Warsaw**: Day 13-16 (4 days: 13,14,15,16)\n     - But wedding is Day 13-15, so adjust:\n       - Warsaw: Day 13-15 (3 days: 13,14,15)\n       - Then fly to Nice on Day 15 (Warsaw-Nice).\n\n5. **Nice**: Day 15-20 (6 days, but needs 5), so:\n   - Nice: Day 15-19 (5 days: 15,16,17,18,19)\n   - Fly to Vienna on Day 19 (Nice-Vienna).\n\n6. **Vienna**: Day 19-20 (2 days: 19,20)\n\nThis satisfies:\n- Porto: 3 days (Day 1-3)\n- Paris: 5 days (Day 3-7, fly to Florence on Day 8? Wait, no:\n   - Paris: Day 3-7 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7)\n   - Fly to Florence on Day 8? But flight day is counted for both, so:\n   - Paris: Day 3-7 (5 days: 3,4,5,6,7)\n   - Florence: Day 7-10 (3 days: 7,8,9)\n   - Munich: Day 10-15 (5 days: 10,11,12,13,14)\n   - Warsaw: Day 14-16 (3 days: 14,15,16)\n   - Nice: Day 16-20 (5 days: 16,17,18,19,20)\n   - Vienna: Day 20 (only 1 day)\n\nStill not perfect. Final working version:\n\n### Final Correct Itinerary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-8\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-16\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n*Issue: Warsaw wedding is missing. Must include Warsaw on Day 13-15.*\n\n### Correct Itinerary Including Warsaw:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-10\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-13\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n*Munich is only 4 days (Day 10-13). To fix:*\n\nAdjust Munich to Day 9-14 (but conflicts with Florence). \n\n### Optimal Solution:\n\nAfter careful planning, the only feasible itinerary that meets all constraints is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-10\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-15\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-17\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n*But Warsaw wedding is Day 13-15, not matching.*\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter exhaustive attempts, here's the correct itinerary satisfying all constraints:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-8\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-16\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n*Note: Warsaw is missing due to conflicting constraints. To include Warsaw, we must adjust other stays, but it's impossible without violating at least one constraint (e.g., Munich's 5 days or Vienna's 2 days).* \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only feasible solution that meets all duration constraints is the above, but it omits Warsaw. To include Warsaw, we must relax one of the other constraints (e.g., reduce Munich or Nice by 1 day). Here's the closest possible with Warsaw:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Paris\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-10\", \"place\": \"Florence\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-13\", \"place\": \"Munich\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-19\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n*Munich is 4 days (short by 1), but this is the best possible given the constraints.*"
