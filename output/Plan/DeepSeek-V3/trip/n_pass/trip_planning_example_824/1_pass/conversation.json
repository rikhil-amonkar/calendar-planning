        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this trip planning problem step by step. We have seven cities to visit over 22 days, with specific durations and some fixed dates for certain cities. We also have a list of direct flight connections between these cities. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Cities and Their Required Stays:\n1. **Berlin**: 5 days (must include days 1-5 for the annual show)\n2. **Split**: 3 days\n3. **Bucharest**: 3 days (must include days 13-15 for visiting relatives)\n4. **Riga**: 5 days\n5. **Lisbon**: 3 days\n6. **Tallinn**: 4 days\n7. **Lyon**: 5 days (must include days 7-11 for a wedding)\n\n### Direct Flight Connections:\n- Lisbon \u2194 Bucharest\n- Berlin \u2194 Lisbon\n- Bucharest \u2194 Riga\n- Berlin \u2194 Riga\n- Split \u2194 Lyon\n- Lisbon \u2194 Riga\n- Riga \u2192 Tallinn\n- Berlin \u2194 Split\n- Lyon \u2194 Lisbon\n- Berlin \u2194 Tallinn\n- Lyon \u2194 Bucharest\n\n### Constraints:\n- Flight days are counted in both cities. For example, if you fly from A to B on day X, day X is the last day in A and the first day in B.\n- Fixed dates:\n  - Berlin: Days 1-5\n  - Lyon: Days 7-11\n  - Bucharest: Days 13-15\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Start with Berlin (Days 1-5)**: Since the show is from day 1 to 5, we must start in Berlin.\n2. **Next, consider Lyon's wedding (Days 7-11)**: We need to be in Lyon by day 7. So, after Berlin, we have day 6 to travel to Lyon.\n   - From Berlin, possible direct flights to Lyon? Checking the list: No direct Berlin-Lyon. So, need to find a connecting path.\n   - Possible paths from Berlin to Lyon:\n     - Berlin \u2192 Split \u2192 Lyon (Berlin-Split and Split-Lyon are direct)\n     - Berlin \u2192 Lisbon \u2192 Lyon (Berlin-Lisbon and Lyon-Lisbon are direct)\n     - Berlin \u2192 Riga \u2192 ... (doesn't seem helpful for Lyon)\n     - Berlin \u2192 Tallinn \u2192 ... (no direct to Lyon)\n   - Berlin-Split-Lyon seems straightforward:\n     - Berlin: Days 1-5\n     - Fly Berlin to Split on day 5 (day 5 is last in Berlin, first in Split)\n     - Split: Days 5-? (need 3 days in Split)\n       - Days 5,6,7 in Split (but need to be in Lyon by day 7)\n       - So Split: Days 5-7 (3 days: 5,6,7)\n       - Fly Split to Lyon on day 7 (day 7 is last in Split, first in Lyon)\n     - Lyon: Days 7-11 (wedding)\n   - This fits perfectly.\n3. **After Lyon (Day 11 onwards)**:\n   - Next fixed date is Bucharest on days 13-15.\n   - From Lyon, possible direct flights:\n     - Lyon \u2194 Lisbon\n     - Lyon \u2194 Bucharest\n     - Lyon \u2194 Split (but already visited Split)\n   - To reach Bucharest by day 13:\n     - Option 1: Lyon \u2192 Bucharest directly (day 11 is last in Lyon, first in Bucharest)\n       - Bucharest: Days 11-13 (but need days 13-15)\n       - Doesn't fit because days 13-15 are required, so Bucharest should start on day 13.\n     - Option 2: Spend some days elsewhere before Bucharest.\n       - From Lyon, can go to Lisbon or Bucharest.\n       - Let's try Lyon \u2192 Lisbon on day 11:\n         - Lisbon: Days 11-13 (3 days: 11,12,13)\n         - Then fly Lisbon \u2192 Bucharest on day 13:\n           - Bucharest: Days 13-15 (3 days: 13,14,15)\n       - This fits Bucharest's requirement.\n4. **After Bucharest (Day 15 onwards)**:\n   - Remaining cities to visit: Riga (5 days), Tallinn (4 days)\n   - From Bucharest, direct flights:\n     - Bucharest \u2194 Riga\n     - Bucharest \u2194 Lisbon (already visited)\n     - Bucharest \u2194 Lyon (visited)\n   - So Bucharest \u2192 Riga on day 15:\n     - Riga: Days 15-19 (5 days: 15,16,17,18,19)\n   - Then from Riga, direct flights:\n     - Riga \u2192 Tallinn\n     - Riga \u2194 Lisbon (visited)\n     - Riga \u2194 Berlin (visited)\n     - Riga \u2194 Bucharest (visited)\n   - So Riga \u2192 Tallinn on day 19:\n     - Tallinn: Days 19-22 (4 days: 19,20,21,22)\n5. **Check all cities visited**:\n   - Berlin: Days 1-5\n   - Split: Days 5-7\n   - Lyon: Days 7-11\n   - Lisbon: Days 11-13\n   - Bucharest: Days 13-15\n   - Riga: Days 15-19\n   - Tallinn: Days 19-22\n   - Total days: 22 (Day 1 to Day 22)\n   - All required durations met:\n     - Berlin: 5\n     - Split: 3\n     - Lyon: 5\n     - Lisbon: 3\n     - Bucharest: 3\n     - Riga: 5\n     - Tallinn: 4\n   - All fixed dates:\n     - Berlin 1-5: yes\n     - Lyon 7-11: yes\n     - Bucharest 13-15: yes\n\n### Final Itinerary:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Berlin\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-7\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-11\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-13\", \"place\": \"Lisbon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Bucharest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-19\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-22\", \"place\": \"Tallinn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- **Berlin**: 1,2,3,4,5 (5 days)\n- **Split**: 5,6,7 (3 days) - day 5 is both last in Berlin and first in Split\n- **Lyon**: 7,8,9,10,11 (5 days) - day 7 is both last in Split and first in Lyon\n- **Lisbon**: 11,12,13 (3 days) - day 11 is both last in Lyon and first in Lisbon\n- **Bucharest**: 13,14,15 (3 days) - day 13 is both last in Lisbon and first in Bucharest\n- **Riga**: 15,16,17,18,19 (5 days) - day 15 is both last in Bucharest and first in Riga\n- **Tallinn**: 19,20,21,22 (4 days) - day 19 is both last in Riga and first in Tallinn\n\nAll constraints are satisfied, and the total is 22 days."
