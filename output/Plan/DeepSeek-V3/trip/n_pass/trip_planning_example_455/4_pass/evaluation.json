    "execution_output": "You're absolutely right - I see the issue now. Let me completely rework this to satisfy all constraints properly, including the exact 2-day stay in Riga.\n\n### Correct Solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-8\", \"place\": \"Istanbul\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-15\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-18\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 18-21\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n1. **Riga: Day 1-2**\n   - Exactly 2 days (meets duration requirement)\n   - Meeting between Day 1-2 is satisfied\n   - Fly to Istanbul on Day 2 (counts as last day in Riga and first day in Istanbul)\n\n2. **Istanbul: Day 2-8**\n   - 7 days total (but we only need 6)\n   - This is because:\n     - Day 2 is flight day (counted for both)\n     - Then Days 3-7 (5 days) for wedding\n     - Plus Day 8 as buffer\n   - Wedding between Day 2-7 is fully covered\n   - Fly to Krakow on Day 8 (counts as last day in Istanbul and first day in Krakow)\n\n3. **Krakow: Day 8-15**\n   - 8 days total (but we only need 7)\n   - This accounts for:\n     - Day 8 as flight day\n     - Then Days 9-15 (7 days)\n   - Fly to Warsaw on Day 15 (counts for both)\n\n4. **Warsaw: Day 15-18**\n   - 4 days total (but we only need 3)\n   - This accounts for:\n     - Day 15 as flight day\n     - Then Days 16-18 (3 days)\n   - Fly to Reykjavik on Day 18 (counts for both)\n\n5. **Reykjavik: Day 18-21**\n   - 4 days total (but we need 7)\n   - This is the remaining constraint that can't be fully met\n\n### Why This Works:\n- All flight days properly overlap (no gaps)\n- Riga gets exactly 2 days\n- Istanbul wedding is fully covered\n- The only violation is Reykjavik's duration (4 days instead of 7)\n\n### Mathematical Reality:\nTotal required days: 2 + 6 + 7 + 3 + 7 = 25\nTotal trip days: 21\nFlight overlaps: 4 (saves 4 days)\n25 - 4 = 21 (exact match)\n\nBut to make the numbers work, some durations must be extended beyond requirements (Istanbul, Krakow, Warsaw) to allow Reykjavik as many days as possible.\n\n### Alternative Solution:\nIf we strictly enforce all durations (no extra days), the only possible solution is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-2\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 2-7\", \"place\": \"Istanbul\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-13\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-15\", \"place\": \"Warsaw\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-21\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis gives Reykjavik 7 days but Istanbul only 5 (needs 6). There's no perfect solution that satisfies all constraints simultaneously given the flight connections and total days. The first solution is the better compromise.",
