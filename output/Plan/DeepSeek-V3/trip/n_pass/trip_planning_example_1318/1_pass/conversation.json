Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this European city-hopping adventure step by step. We have nine cities to visit over 25 days, with specific durations and some fixed events. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. List the Cities and Required Days:\n- Oslo: 2 days (must be there between day 24-25)\n- Helsinki: 2 days\n- Edinburgh: 3 days\n- Riga: 2 days\n- Tallinn: 5 days (wedding between day 4-8)\n- Budapest: 5 days\n- Vilnius: 5 days\n- Porto: 5 days\n- Geneva: 4 days\n\nTotal days accounted for: 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 33 days. Wait, that's more than 25! Oh no, that's a problem. \n\nWait a minute, the flight days are counted for both cities, so overlapping days reduce the total. For example, if you fly from A to B on day X, day X counts for both A and B. So the total unique days should sum to 25, but the sum of individual stays minus overlapping flight days should equal 25.\n\nBut calculating overlaps is tricky. Maybe it's better to think in terms of transitions: for 9 cities, there are 8 flights (transitions), meaning 8 overlapping days. So sum of all stays is 33, overlaps are 8, so total is 33 - 8 = 25. That checks out.\n\n### 2. Fixed Events:\n- Tallinn wedding: must be between day 4-8, meaning Tallinn must include these days. Since it's 5 days, it could be day 4-8, or day 3-7, etc., but must cover 4-8.\n- Oslo meet friend: must be between day 24-25. Oslo is 2 days, so it must be day 24-25 (since day 25 is the last day).\n\n### 3. Flight Connections:\nWe have a list of direct flights between cities. This means we can only move between cities that have a direct flight connection.\n\n### 4. Constructing the Itinerary:\nGiven Oslo is at the end (day 24-25), let's work backwards and forwards.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Start with Tallinn since it has a fixed event (wedding day 4-8). Let's place Tallinn first to cover the wedding.\n- Then connect to other cities based on flight availability, ensuring Oslo is last.\n\n**Possible Sequence:**\n1. Start in Tallinn (wedding days 4-8). So Tallinn could be day 1-5 (covering day 4-8).\n   - But then day 1-5 is Tallinn, but wedding is day 4-8, so day 1-5 includes 4-8. That works.\n2. From Tallinn, direct flights to: Vilnius, Helsinki, Oslo, Riga.\n   - Next city: Let's choose Riga (2 days). Flight from Tallinn to Riga on day 5 (overlap).\n   - Riga: day 5-6 (since 2 days, day 5 is arrival, day 6 is full day, leave on day 7).\n3. From Riga, direct flights to: Tallinn, Oslo, Helsinki, Vilnius.\n   - Next: Helsinki (2 days). Flight on day 7.\n   - Helsinki: day 7-8.\n4. From Helsinki, direct flights to: Vilnius, Tallinn, Oslo, Riga, Budapest, Geneva, Edinburgh.\n   - Next: Vilnius (5 days). Flight on day 8.\n   - Vilnius: day 8-12.\n5. From Vilnius, direct flights to: Helsinki, Oslo, Tallinn, Riga.\n   - Next: Oslo is last, so not now. Maybe Budapest.\n   - But no direct Vilnius-Budapest. Next option: Oslo (but not last), or back to Helsinki.\n   - Maybe go to Helsinki again? Not efficient. Or to Oslo, but Oslo is last.\n   - Maybe this path isn't working. Let's backtrack.\n\nAlternative after Helsinki (day 7-8):\nFrom Helsinki, go to Budapest (5 days). Flight on day 8.\n- Budapest: day 8-12.\nFrom Budapest, direct flights to: Oslo, Geneva, Edinburgh, Helsinki.\n- Next: Geneva (4 days). Flight on day 12.\n- Geneva: day 12-15.\nFrom Geneva, direct flights to: Oslo, Porto, Edinburgh, Budapest, Helsinki.\n- Next: Porto (5 days). Flight on day 15.\n- Porto: day 15-19.\nFrom Porto, direct flights to: Oslo, Geneva, Edinburgh.\n- Next: Edinburgh (3 days). Flight on day 19.\n- Edinburgh: day 19-21.\nFrom Edinburgh, direct flights to: Oslo, Porto, Geneva, Budapest, Helsinki, Riga.\n- Next: Riga (but already visited). Oslo is last, but need to fit Oslo at day 24-25.\n- Maybe go to Oslo now, but need to adjust days.\nWait, current day is 21, Oslo is 2 days at 24-25, so need to fill 21-24.\nFrom Edinburgh, can go to Helsinki (not needed), or Riga (already done), or Oslo.\nMaybe go to Oslo early, but then can't meet friend at end.\nAlternative: from Edinburgh, go to Riga (but already did Riga).\nThis path seems stuck. Maybe need a different sequence.\n\n**Alternative Sequence:**\n1. Tallinn: day 1-5 (wedding day 4-8).\n2. From Tallinn to Riga: day 5.\n   - Riga: day 5-6.\n3. From Riga to Oslo: day 6.\n   - Oslo: day 6-7 (but Oslo must be at end). Not working.\nAbandon this.\n\n**Another Approach: Start with Edinburgh:**\n1. Edinburgh: day 1-3.\n2. From Edinburgh, direct to Oslo, Porto, Geneva, Budapest, Helsinki, Riga.\n   - Next: Riga (2 days). Flight on day 3.\n   - Riga: day 3-4.\n3. From Riga to Tallinn: day 4.\n   - Tallinn: day 4-8 (wedding covered).\n4. From Tallinn to Vilnius: day 8.\n   - Vilnius: day 8-12.\n5. From Vilnius to Helsinki: day 12.\n   - Helsinki: day 12-13.\n6. From Helsinki to Budapest: day 13.\n   - Budapest: day 13-17.\n7. From Budapest to Geneva: day 17.\n   - Geneva: day 17-20.\n8. From Geneva to Porto: day 20.\n   - Porto: day 20-24.\n9. From Porto to Oslo: day 24.\n   - Oslo: day 24-25.\n\nThis fits all constraints:\n- Oslo at end (24-25).\n- Tallinn wedding (4-8).\n- All stays correct:\n  - Edinburgh: 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Riga: 3-4 (2 days)\n  - Tallinn: 4-8 (5 days)\n  - Vilnius: 8-12 (5 days)\n  - Helsinki: 12-13 (2 days)\n  - Budapest: 13-17 (5 days)\n  - Geneva: 17-20 (4 days)\n  - Porto: 20-24 (5 days)\n  - Oslo: 24-25 (2 days)\n- Flight connections:\n  - Edinburgh-Riga: yes\n  - Riga-Tallinn: yes\n  - Tallinn-Vilnius: yes\n  - Vilnius-Helsinki: yes\n  - Helsinki-Budapest: yes\n  - Budapest-Geneva: yes\n  - Geneva-Porto: yes\n  - Porto-Oslo: yes\n\nPerfect!\n\n### Final Itinerary in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Edinburgh\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Riga\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\", \"place\": \"Tallinn\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-12\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-13\", \"place\": \"Helsinki\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-17\", \"place\": \"Budapest\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-20\", \"place\": \"Geneva\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 20-24\", \"place\": \"Porto\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 24-25\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- Total unique days: 25 (from day 1 to 25).\n- Each city's duration:\n  - Edinburgh: 3 (1,2,3)\n  - Riga: 2 (3,4) - day 3 overlaps\n  - Tallinn: 5 (4,5,6,7,8) - day 4 overlaps\n  - Vilnius: 5 (8,9,10,11,12) - day 8 overlaps\n  - Helsinki: 2 (12,13) - day 12 overlaps\n  - Budapest: 5 (13,14,15,16,17) - day 13 overlaps\n  - Geneva: 4 (17,18,19,20) - day 17 overlaps\n  - Porto: 5 (20,21,22,23,24) - day 20 overlaps\n  - Oslo: 2 (24,25) - day 24 overlaps\n- Overlaps: 8 (one per transition), so total days: sum of individual stays (33) - overlaps (8) = 25. Correct.\n- Flight connections all valid as per the list.\n- Fixed events:\n  - Tallinn wedding: day 4-8 covered.\n  - Oslo meet: day 24-25.\n\nEverything checks out!"
