Currently, we have:\n- Berlin: 1-3\n- Barcelona: 3-4\n- Lyon: 4-5\n- Nice: 5-10\n- Athens: 10-15\n- Stockholm: 15-20\nTotal: 20 days, but missing Vilnius.\n\nAlternative after Athens:\nInstead of Stockholm, go to Vilnius from Athens.\n- Fly from Athens to Vilnius on Day 15.\n  - **Vilnius**: Day 15-19 (4 days)\nThen from Vilnius, where?\nDirect flights: Athens, Berlin.\nAthens already visited, Berlin is possible but we've been there.\nWait, seems stuck. Maybe need to adjust earlier.\n\nAlternative approach after Nice:\nInstead of Athens after Nice, go to Stockholm.\n- Fly from Nice to Stockholm on Day 10.\n  - **Stockholm**: Day 10-15 (5 days)\nFrom Stockholm, where?\nDirect flights: Athens, Nice, Berlin, Barcelona.\nNice and Barcelona visited, Berlin already.\nSo Athens.\n- Fly from Stockholm to Athens on Day 15.\n  - **Athens**: Day 15-20 (5 days)\nBut then Vilnius is missing.\n\nHmm, seems like Vilnius is hard to fit. Maybe need to insert it earlier.\n\nAlternative after Barcelona:\nInstead of Lyon after Barcelona, go somewhere else where we can later reach Lyon for the wedding.\nBut wedding is between Day 4-5, so must be in Lyon on Day 4-5.\n\nAlternative is to adjust after Lyon.\nFrom Lyon, instead of Nice, go to Vilnius.\nBut no direct flight Lyon to Vilnius. Only Lyon to Nice or Barcelona.\nSo must go to Nice from Lyon.\n\nAlternative is to have Vilnius after Nice.\nFrom Nice, fly to Vilnius.\nBut no direct flight Nice to Vilnius.\nOnly Nice to Athens, then Athens to Vilnius.\nSo:\n- Nice: 5-10\n- Fly Nice to Athens on Day 10\n- Athens: 10-11 (just 1 day to transfer)\n- Fly Athens to Vilnius on Day 11\n- Vilnius: 11-15 (4 days)\nThen from Vilnius to where? Athens or Berlin.\nAthens already, Berlin already.\nStuck.\n\nAlternative is to have Vilnius earlier.\nFrom Berlin, after Day 3, instead of Barcelona, go to Vilnius.\nBut workshop in Barcelona is between Day 3-4, so must be in Barcelona on Day 3-4.\nCannot skip Barcelona.\n\nSeems the only way is to have Vilnius after Stockholm or Athens, but then can't cover all days.\n\nWait, maybe after Athens, go to Vilnius for 4 days, then back to Stockholm for 1 day.\nBut Stockholm needs 5 days total.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the initial plan with missing Vilnius is acceptable, but we must include Vilnius.\n\nLet me try this sequence:\n\n1. Berlin: 1-3\n2. Barcelona: 3-4 (workshop)\n3. Lyon: 4-5 (wedding)\n4. Nice: 5-10\n5. Athens: 10-15\n6. Vilnius: 15-19\n7. Stockholm: 19-24 (but only 20 days total, so can't)\n\nNot working. Need to reduce somewhere.\n\nAlternative: reduce Athens or Stockholm by overlapping with Vilnius.\nBut all stays are fixed durations.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\n1. Berlin: 1-3\n2. Barcelona: 3-4\n3. Lyon: 4-5\n4. Nice: 5-10\n5. Stockholm: 10-15\n6. Athens: 15-20\nBut Vilnius missing.\n\nAlternatively, include Vilnius between Stockholm and Athens:\nFrom Stockholm, fly to Vilnius, then to Athens.\nBut Stockholm to Vilnius: no direct flight.\nOnly via Athens or Berlin.\n\nThis seems impossible with given constraints. Maybe initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative start:\nFrom Berlin, fly to Vilnius on Day 3.\nBut then how to reach Barcelona for workshop on Day 3-4?\nNo direct Vilnius to Barcelona. Only via Athens or Berlin.\nNot possible.\n\nConclusion: It's impossible to include Vilnius with the given constraints and flight connections while meeting all other requirements.\n\nBut since the problem states we must visit all 7 cities, perhaps I missed a connection.\n\nWait, from Vilnius, can go to Athens, then to Barcelona.\nBut timing is tight.\n\nTry:\n1. Berlin: 1-3\n2. Vilnius: 3-7 (fly Berlin to Vilnius on Day 3)\n   - Then from Vilnius, fly to Athens on Day 7\n3. Athens: 7-8 (just to transfer)\n4. Fly Athens to Barcelona on Day 8\n   - But workshop is between Day 3-4, so too late.\nNot working.\n\nFinal attempt:\nMaybe workshop is not exactly on Day 3-4, but spanning that time.\nBut problem states \"between day 3 and day 4\", meaning must be in Barcelona on Day 3 and 4.\n\nGiven that, seems impossible to include Vilnius unless we can have overlapping stays, which we can't.\n\nThus, the only feasible itinerary without Vilnius is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Berlin\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-5\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-10\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-15\", \"place\": \"Athens\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-20\", \"place\": \"Stockholm\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nBut this misses Vilnius. Given the constraints, it's impossible to include Vilnius without violating other requirements. Therefore, the correct itinerary excluding Vilnius is as above. However, since the problem insists on visiting all 7 cities, there might be an error in flight connections or interpretations.\n\nUpon re-reading, perhaps the workshop in Barcelona is on the night of Day 3 to morning of Day 4, meaning Barcelona is Day 3-4 (2 days), and similarly for Lyon wedding.\n\nAlternative with Vilnius:\n\n1. Berlin: 1-3\n2. Barcelona: 3-4\n3. Lyon: 4-5\n4. Nice: 5-10\n5. Vilnius: 10-14 (fly Nice to Athens to Vilnius)\n   - Nice to Athens on Day 10\n   - Athens: 10-11\n   - Athens to Vilnius on Day 11\n   - Vilnius: 11-14\n6. From Vilnius, fly to Athens on Day 14\n   - Athens: 14-19\n7. Then Athens to Stockholm on Day 19\n   - Stockholm: 19-24 (but only up to Day 20, so 19-20 (2 days), but need 5.\n\nThis doesn't work. Hence, it's impossible to include Vilnius with given constraints.\n\nFinal answer (excluding Vilnius):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Berlin\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-5\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-10\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-15\", \"place\": \"Athens\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 15-20\", \"place\": \"Stockholm\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since Vilnius must be included, and given the flight connections, the only possible way is to adjust stays, which isn't allowed. Therefore, the problem might have inconsistent constraints, making it unsolvable as stated.\n\n**Final Answer (Including Vilnius with Adjusted Stays - Assuming Possible Overlaps or Errors in Constraints):**\n\nAfter careful consideration, here's a possible itinerary including Vilnius by slightly adjusting the stays (though it may not perfectly fit all original constraints):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Berlin\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-4\", \"place\": \"Barcelona\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-5\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-10\", \"place\": \"Nice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 10-14\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-19\", \"place\": \"Athens\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-20\", \"place\": \"Stockholm\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n*Note: Stockholm is only 2 days here instead of 5, which violates the original requirement. Hence, the problem as stated may not have a valid solution that includes all cities with their specified stay durations and flight connections.*"
