    "execution_output": "Let me carefully re-examine the constraints and try to construct a valid 25-day itinerary that includes all 8 cities with their required stays, while respecting the flight connections and fixed events.\n\nKey Issues from Previous Attempt:\n1. Missed Reykjavik entirely\n2. Had Prague for 8 total days (two separate visits)\n3. Flight days counting for both cities makes scheduling tight\n\nNew Approach:\n- Start in Reykjavik (5 days) since it's isolated in flight connections\n- Then proceed to cities that connect to Edinburgh for the show\n- Ensure Split includes wedding days (19-23)\n- Allocate exact required days for each city\n\nRevised Itinerary:\n\n1. **Reykjavik**: Day 1-5 (5 days)\n   - Fly to Stuttgart on Day 5 (Reykjavik connects to Stuttgart)\n\n2. **Stuttgart**: Day 5-9 (4 days*) \n   - *Note: Need 5 days total for Stuttgart, but we'll get the 5th day when flying out\n   - Fly to Edinburgh on Day 9 (Stuttgart connects to Edinburgh)\n\n3. **Edinburgh**: Day 9-13 (5 days total)\n   - Includes show days (but show was supposed to be Day 5-8 - conflict!)\n   \nThis shows the fundamental problem - the Edinburgh show (Day 5-8) MUST occur during Edinburgh visit, but starting in Reykjavik makes this impossible.\n\nAlternative Revised Plan (prioritizing Edinburgh show):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-4\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 4-8\", \"place\": \"Edinburgh\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-13\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-17\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-20\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 20-25\", \"place\": \"Split\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis still misses Stuttgart and Manchester. After multiple attempts, it appears impossible to visit all 8 cities in 25 days while:\n- Having flight days count for both cities\n- Meeting all duration requirements\n- Respecting fixed event dates\n\nThe constraints are too tight - the minimum required days (with overlaps) exceed 25. Would need to either:\n1. Remove 1 city (likely Stuttgart or Manchester)\n2. Reduce some stays\n3. Not count flight days for both cities\n\nSince we must keep all cities, here's a compromise solution that slightly reduces Stuttgart's stay to make it fit:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"}, // Reduced from 5 to 4 days\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-8\", \"place\": \"Edinburgh\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-12\", \"place\": \"Prague\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-16\", \"place\": \"Vienna\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 16-19\", \"place\": \"Lyon\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 19-23\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 23-25\", \"place\": \"Manchester\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 25-25\", \"place\": \"Reykjavik\"} // 1 day only\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis still doesn't fully satisfy requirements. Therefore, the only feasible solution is to acknowledge that visiting all 8 cities within 25 days under these constraints is mathematically impossible without violating at least one requirement.",
