    "execution_output": "You're right\u2014the previous solution had a gap/overlap issue between Day 2 and Day 3 because Madrid ended on Day 2, and Berlin started on Day 3, meaning there was no flight day connecting them (which violates the rule that flight days count for both cities). Let me fix this by ensuring transitions are properly handled.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Madrid must include Day 2 or 3** (interpreted as at least one day in that range).  \n2. **Berlin must be Days 3-7** (wedding).  \n3. **Flight days must connect cities directly**, and the flight day counts for both cities.  \n\n### Corrected Itinerary:\nTo ensure Madrid and Berlin connect properly, Madrid must end on Day 3 (so Day 3 is both the last day in Madrid and the first day in Berlin).  \n\nHere's the corrected plan:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},  // Includes Day 2 (relatives) and overlaps Day 3 with Berlin\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Berlin\"},  // Wedding: Day 3-7 (Day 3 is flight day from Madrid)\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Dublin\"},  // Friends: Day 7-9 (Day 7 is flight day from Berlin)\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-12\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},   // 3 days (direct flight from Dublin)\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-13\", \"place\": \"London\"} // 2 days (direct flight from Oslo)\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Why This Works:\n- **Madrid (Day 1-3)**:  \n  - Covers Day 2 (relatives) and overlaps Day 3 with Berlin (flight day).  \n- **Berlin (Day 3-7)**:  \n  - Wedding constraint met. Day 3 is shared with Madrid.  \n- **Dublin (Day 7-9)**:  \n  - Friends met (Day 7-9). Day 7 is shared with Berlin.  \n- **Oslo (Day 9-12)**:  \n  - Direct flight from Dublin (valid connection).  \n- **London (Day 12-13)**:  \n  - Direct flight from Oslo (valid connection).  \n\n### Adjusted City Days:\n- Madrid: 3 days (originally 2) \u2192 Extra day is the flight day (Day 3).  \n- Berlin: 5 days (correct).  \n- Dublin: 3 days (correct).  \n- Oslo: 3 days (correct).  \n- London: 2 days (correct).  \n- **Vilnius**: Omitted due to time constraints (only 13 days).  \n\n### If Vilnius Must Be Included:\nTo include Vilnius, we\u2019d need to drop another city (e.g., London or Oslo). Here\u2019s an alternative:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Berlin\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Dublin\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-12\", \"place\": \"Vilnius\"}, // Direct from Dublin\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-13\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"}    // Direct from Vilnius\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis sacrifices London but includes Vilnius.  \n\n### Final Answer (Prioritizing All Constraints):\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-3\", \"place\": \"Madrid\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 3-7\", \"place\": \"Berlin\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 7-9\", \"place\": \"Dublin\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 9-12\", \"place\": \"Oslo\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 12-13\", \"place\": \"London\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis satisfies all strict constraints (wedding, relatives, friends) and direct flights, though Vilnius is omitted. To include Vilnius, adjust as shown above.",
