Include all city visits with their day ranges. Do not include separate flight entries in the JSON output.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you fly from city A to city B on day X, that day counts for BOTH cities. For example:\n- If you stay in Venice from Day 1-3 and fly to Vienna on Day 3, then:\n  - Venice: Day 1-3 (3 days)\n  - Vienna: Day 3-6 (4 days, including the flight day)\n- The flight day (Day 3) is counted for both Venice and Vienna.\n- Do NOT create separate flight entries in the JSON."

        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this trip planning problem step by step. I'll break down the requirements and constraints to come up with a feasible itinerary.\n\n### Understanding the Requirements\n\n1. **Total Trip Duration**: 18 days.\n2. **Cities to Visit**: Split, Santorini, London.\n3. **Days in Each City**:\n   - Split: 6 days.\n   - Santorini: 7 days (must include Day 12 and Day 18 for the conference).\n   - London: 7 days.\n4. **Direct Flight Connections**:\n   - London \u2194 Santorini.\n   - Split \u2194 London.\n   - *No direct flight between Split and Santorini*.\n5. **Flight Day Counting**: The day you fly from city A to city B is counted in both cities' stays.\n\n### Constraints to Consider\n\n- **Conference in Santorini**: Must be in Santorini on Day 12 and Day 18.\n  - This means Santorini must include at least Day 12 and Day 18 in its 7-day stay.\n- **Flight Connections**: Since there's no direct flight between Split and Santorini, any transfer between them must go through London.\n  \n### Determining the Santorini Stay\n\nGiven that Santorini must include Day 12 and Day 18, let's see how the 7 days can be allocated:\n\nOption 1: Continuous block including both days.\n- For example, Day 12-18 is 7 days (12,13,14,15,16,17,18).\n  \nOption 2: Non-continuous, but this seems unnecessary since we can have a continuous block that satisfies both conference days.\n\nSo, Santorini: Day 12-18 (7 days).\n\n### Allocating Split and London\n\nNow, we have to allocate Split (6 days) and London (7 days) in the remaining days (before Day 12 and after Day 18 is not applicable since the trip ends on Day 18).\n\nBut wait, the trip is 18 days, and Santorini is from Day 12-18, which is the latter part. So before Day 12, we have Days 1-11 (11 days) to allocate Split and London.\n\nBut we have:\n- Split: 6 days.\n- London: 7 days.\nTotal: 13 days, but we only have 11 days before Santorini. This suggests that some of the London or Split days must overlap with the Santorini stay, which isn't possible since you can't be in two places at once.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The flight days count for both cities, so let's think differently.\n\n### Reconstructing the Itinerary\n\nGiven the flight day counts for both cities, let's think about the sequence of cities.\n\nPossible sequences considering flight connections:\n1. Split \u2192 London \u2192 Santorini \u2192 London \u2192 Split\n   - But this seems too many flights, and we have limited flight connections.\n2. Split \u2192 London \u2192 Santorini (and stay there until end)\n   - Or Split \u2192 London \u2192 Santorini \u2192 London (but then we'd have to go back to Split, which may not be necessary unless we're ending there, but the trip ends in Santorini on Day 18).\n\nGiven that, let's try:\n\nStart in Split (since we have to spend time there), then go to London, then to Santorini.\n\nLet's assign:\n\n1. Start in Split.\n   - Let's say Day 1-6 in Split.\n   - On Day 6, fly to London. So Day 6 is in both Split and London.\n   - So Split: Day 1-6 (6 days).\n   - London starts on Day 6.\n\n2. London:\n   - From Day 6 onwards. Need 7 days in London.\n   - So Day 6-12 in London (since Day 12 is the start of Santorini).\n   - Count: Day 6,7,8,9,10,11,12 - that's 7 days.\n   - On Day 12, fly to Santorini. So Day 12 is in both London and Santorini.\n\n3. Santorini:\n   - From Day 12-18.\n   - Count: Day 12,13,14,15,16,17,18 - that's 7 days.\n   - Includes both conference days (12 and 18).\n\nNow let's check the totals:\n- Split: Day 1-6 - 6 days.\n- London: Day 6-12 - 7 days (including flight day).\n- Santorini: Day 12-18 - 7 days (including flight day).\nTotal: 18 days. Perfect!\n\n### Verifying Flight Connections\n\n- Split to London: Direct flight exists - yes.\n- London to Santorini: Direct flight exists - yes.\n- No need to go back to Split or London after Santorini, as the trip ends there.\n\n### Final Itinerary\n\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 1-6\",\n      \"place\": \"Split\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 6-12\",\n      \"place\": \"London\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"day_range\": \"Day 12-18\",\n      \"place\": \"Santorini\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Day Counting\n\n- **Split (Day 1-6)**: \n  - Days 1,2,3,4,5 in Split.\n  - Day 6: Fly to London - counts for both Split and London.\n  - So Split gets 6 days (1-6).\n\n- **London (Day 6-12)**:\n  - Day 6: Arrive from Split - counts for London.\n  - Days 7,8,9,10,11 in London.\n  - Day 12: Fly to Santorini - counts for both London and Santorini.\n  - So London gets 7 days (6-12).\n\n- **Santorini (Day 12-18)**:\n  - Day 12: Arrive from London - counts for Santorini.\n  - Days 13,14,15,16,17 in Santorini.\n  - Day 18: Last day in Santorini - counts for Santorini.\n  - So Santorini gets 7 days (12-18).\n\nAll constraints are satisfied:\n- Total days: 18.\n- Split: 6 days.\n- London: 7 days.\n- Santorini: 7 days (includes Day 12 and 18).\n- Only direct flights used."
