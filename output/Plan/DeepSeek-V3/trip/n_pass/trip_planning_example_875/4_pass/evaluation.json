    "execution_output": "After carefully reviewing the constraints again, I notice the issue occurs between Edinburgh (Day 5-8) and Krakow (Day 9-12). The transition should have an overlapping flight day, but currently shows a gap. Here's the corrected itinerary that properly handles all transitions:\n\n### Final Correct Itinerary:\n\n1. **Venice**: Day 1-5 (5 days)\n   - Fly to Edinburgh on Day 5 (flight day counted for both)\n2. **Edinburgh**: Day 5-8 (4 days)\n   - Fly to Krakow on Day 8 (flight day counted for both)\n3. **Krakow**: Day 8-11 (4 days, includes meeting friend between Day 8-11)\n   - Fly to Stuttgart on Day 11 (overlap day)\n4. **Stuttgart**: Day 11-13 (3 days, includes workshop between Day 11-13)\n   - Fly to Split on Day 13 (overlap day)\n5. **Split**: Day 13-14 (2 days, meets friends between Day 13-14)\n   - Fly to Athens on Day 14 (overlap day)\n6. **Athens**: Day 14-17 (4 days)\n   - Fly to Mykonos on Day 17 (overlap day)\n7. **Mykonos**: Day 17-20 (4 days)\n\n### Key Fixes:\n- Now flying from Edinburgh to Krakow on Day 8 (counts for both)\n- Adjusted Krakow dates to Day 8-11 to maintain 4 days\n- Ensured all timing constraints are still met\n- No gaps between any cities\n\n### Final JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"itinerary\": [\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 1-5\", \"place\": \"Venice\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 5-8\", \"place\": \"Edinburgh\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 8-11\", \"place\": \"Krakow\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 11-13\", \"place\": \"Stuttgart\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 13-14\", \"place\": \"Split\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 14-17\", \"place\": \"Athens\"},\n    {\"day_range\": \"Day 17-20\", \"place\": \"Mykonos\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- Venice: 5 days (1-5)\n- Edinburgh: 4 days (5-8) - Day 5 overlaps with Venice\n- Krakow: 4 days (8-11) - Day 8 overlaps with Edinburgh, includes meeting window\n- Stuttgart: 3 days (11-13) - covers workshop\n- Split: 2 days (13-14) - meets friends\n- Athens: 4 days (14-17)\n- Mykonos: 4 days (17-20)\n- Total: 5 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 26 days - 6 overlaps = 20 days\n- All direct flight connections maintained\n- No gaps between any visits\n- All special timing requirements satisfied\n\nThis solution now correctly handles all transitions with proper overlapping flight days while meeting all constraints.",
