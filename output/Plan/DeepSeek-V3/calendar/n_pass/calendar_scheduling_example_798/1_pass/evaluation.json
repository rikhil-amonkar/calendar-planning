We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday where both Nancy and Jose are available. We also want to find the earliest possible time that fits these criteria.\n\n### Understanding the Schedules\n\nFirst, let's list out the busy times for both Nancy and Jose on each day.\n\n#### Monday:\n- **Nancy's busy times:**\n  - 10:00 - 10:30\n  - 11:30 - 12:30\n  - 13:30 - 14:00\n  - 14:30 - 15:30\n  - 16:00 - 17:00\n- **Jose's busy times:**\n  - 9:00 - 17:00 (entire day)\n\n**Observation:** Jose is busy the entire day on Monday. So, no availability on Monday.\n\n#### Tuesday:\n- **Nancy's busy times:**\n  - 9:30 - 10:30\n  - 11:00 - 11:30\n  - 12:00 - 12:30\n  - 13:00 - 13:30\n  - 15:30 - 16:00\n- **Jose's busy times:**\n  - 9:00 - 17:00 (entire day)\n\n**Observation:** Jose is also busy the entire day on Tuesday. So, no availability on Tuesday.\n\n#### Wednesday:\n- **Nancy's busy times:**\n  - 10:00 - 11:30\n  - 13:30 - 16:00\n- **Jose's busy times:**\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 10:00 - 12:30\n  - 13:30 - 14:30\n  - 15:00 - 17:00\n\nNow, let's find the available slots on Wednesday where both are free for at least 30 minutes.\n\n### Finding Available Slots on Wednesday\n\nWork hours: 9:00 - 17:00\n\nLet's list the busy times for both on Wednesday:\n\n- **Nancy:**\n  - 10:00 - 11:30\n  - 13:30 - 16:00\n- **Jose:**\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 10:00 - 12:30\n  - 13:30 - 14:30\n  - 15:00 - 17:00\n\nNow, let's find the overlapping free times.\n\nFirst, let's see when both are free by looking at the gaps in their schedules.\n\n**Nancy's free periods on Wednesday:**\n1. 9:00 - 10:00\n2. 11:30 - 13:30\n3. 16:00 - 17:00\n\n**Jose's free periods on Wednesday:**\n1. 9:30 - 10:00\n2. 12:30 - 13:30\n3. 14:30 - 15:00\n\nNow, let's find overlaps between Nancy's and Jose's free times.\n\n1. **Nancy: 9:00 - 10:00**\n   - Jose: 9:30 - 10:00\n   - Overlap: 9:30 - 10:00 (30 minutes) \u2705\n   \n   This is a potential slot: 9:30 - 10:00.\n\n2. **Nancy: 11:30 - 13:30**\n   - Jose: 12:30 - 13:30\n   - Overlap: 12:30 - 13:30 (60 minutes)\n   - Possible slots within this:\n     - 12:30 - 13:00\n     - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - But we're looking for the earliest, so 9:30 - 10:00 is earlier.\n\n3. **Nancy: 16:00 - 17:00**\n   - Jose is busy until 17:00, so no overlap here.\n\n**Other overlaps:**\n- Jose's 14:30 - 15:00 is during Nancy's busy time (13:30 - 16:00), so no overlap.\n\nSo, the earliest available slot is **9:30 - 10:00 on Wednesday**.\n\nLet's double-check:\n\n- **Nancy on Wednesday at 9:30 - 10:00:**\n  - Busy: 10:00 - 11:30 \u2192 free at 9:30 - 10:00.\n- **Jose on Wednesday at 9:30 - 10:00:**\n  - Busy: 9:00 - 9:30, next busy at 10:00 - 12:30 \u2192 free at 9:30 - 10:00.\n\nBoth are free during this time, and it's the earliest possible slot that fits.\n\n### Verifying Earlier Days\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm that Monday and Tuesday indeed have no availability.\n\n- **Monday:**\n  - Jose is busy all day.\n  \n- **Tuesday:**\n  - Jose is busy all day.\n\nSo, Wednesday is the only possible day.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe earliest available 30-minute slot where both Nancy and Jose are free is:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"09:30:10:00\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```",
