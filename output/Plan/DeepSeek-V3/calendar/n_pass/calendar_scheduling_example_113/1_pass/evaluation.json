We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where all four participants\u2014Bradley, Teresa, Elizabeth, and Christian\u2014are free. \n\nFirst, let's list out each person's busy times in chronological order to visualize the overlaps and find the gaps where everyone is available.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Bradley**:\n   - 9:30 - 10:00\n   - 12:30 - 13:00\n   - 13:30 - 14:00\n   - 15:30 - 16:00\n\n2. **Teresa**:\n   - 10:30 - 11:00\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n\n3. **Elizabeth**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:30 - 11:30\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n   - 15:30 - 17:00\n\n4. **Christian**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:30 - 17:00\n\n### Analyzing Christian's Schedule:\nChristian is busy from 10:30 onwards for the entire day until 17:00. This means any meeting must start before 10:30 because after that, Christian is unavailable. \n\nSo, the possible meeting times are between 9:00 and 10:30, minus any times when others are busy during that period.\n\n### Potential Time Slots Before 10:30:\n\nLet's look at the time from 9:00 to 10:30 in 30-minute increments and check each slot:\n\n1. **9:00 - 9:30**:\n   - Bradley: Free (first meeting at 9:30)\n   - Teresa: Free (first meeting at 10:30)\n   - Elizabeth: Busy (9:00 - 9:30)\n   - Christian: Busy (9:00 - 9:30)\n   - **Not available** (Elizabeth and Christian busy)\n\n2. **9:30 - 10:00**:\n   - Bradley: Busy (9:30 - 10:00)\n   - Teresa: Free\n   - Elizabeth: Free (after 9:30, next busy at 10:30)\n   - Christian: Free (after 9:30, next busy at 10:30)\n   - **Not available** (Bradley busy)\n\n3. **10:00 - 10:30**:\n   - Bradley: Free (last meeting was 9:30 - 10:00, next at 12:30)\n   - Teresa: Free (first meeting at 10:30, so free until then)\n   - Elizabeth: Free (next busy at 10:30)\n   - Christian: Free (next busy at 10:30)\n   - **All free!**\n\n### Verifying 10:00 - 10:30:\n- Bradley: No meetings between 10:00 - 10:30.\n- Teresa: No meetings until 10:30.\n- Elizabeth: No meetings until 10:30.\n- Christian: No meetings until 10:30.\n\nThis slot is entirely free for all participants.\n\n### Checking Other Possible Slots After 10:30:\nJust to be thorough, let's see if there's any other possible slot after 10:30 where Christian might be free, but according to the given schedule, Christian is busy from 10:30 to 17:00. So, no other slots are possible beyond 10:30.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only 30-minute slot where all four participants are free is **10:00 - 10:30** on Monday.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"10:00:10:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
