You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Bradley, Teresa, Elizabeth and Christian for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nBradley has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nTeresa has meetings on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00; \nElizabeth has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nChristian has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}\n\nFor example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"

We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where all four participants\u2014Bradley, Teresa, Elizabeth, and Christian\u2014are available. \n\nFirst, let's list out each person's busy times in a more visual way to see where the overlaps are.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Bradley**:\n   - 9:30 - 10:00\n   - 12:30 - 13:00\n   - 13:30 - 14:00\n   - 15:30 - 16:00\n\n2. **Teresa**:\n   - 10:30 - 11:00\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n\n3. **Elizabeth**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:30 - 11:30\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n   - 15:30 - 17:00\n\n4. **Christian**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:30 - 17:00\n\n### Analyzing Availability:\n\nLet's go through each possible 30-minute slot within 9:00-17:00 and check if everyone is free.\n\n1. **9:00 - 9:30**:\n   - Bradley: Free\n   - Teresa: Free\n   - Elizabeth: Busy (9:00 - 9:30)\n   - Christian: Busy (9:00 - 9:30)\n   - **Not available**\n\n2. **9:30 - 10:00**:\n   - Bradley: Busy (9:30 - 10:00)\n   - Teresa: Free\n   - Elizabeth: Free (after 9:30)\n   - Christian: Free (until 10:30)\n   - Bradley is busy, so **Not available**\n\n3. **10:00 - 10:30**:\n   - Bradley: Free\n   - Teresa: Free\n   - Elizabeth: Free (until 10:30)\n   - Christian: Free (until 10:30)\n   - **All free!** But let's check if this is within work hours and no overlaps.\n   - Wait, Christian is free until 10:30, so 10:00 - 10:30 is free for all.\n   - But Elizabeth is free until 10:30, but her next busy time starts at 10:30, so 10:00 - 10:30 is okay.\n   - **Potential slot: 10:00 - 10:30**\n\nBut let's check if there are other slots to ensure this is the only one or if there are more options.\n\n4. **10:30 - 11:00**:\n   - Bradley: Free\n   - Teresa: Busy (10:30 - 11:00)\n   - Elizabeth: Busy (10:30 - 11:30)\n   - Christian: Busy (10:30 - 17:00)\n   - **Not available**\n\n5. **11:00 - 11:30**:\n   - Bradley: Free\n   - Teresa: Free (after 11:00)\n   - Elizabeth: Busy (until 11:30)\n   - Christian: Busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n6. **11:30 - 12:00**:\n   - Bradley: Free\n   - Teresa: Free\n   - Elizabeth: Free (after 11:30)\n   - Christian: Busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n7. **12:00 - 12:30**:\n   - Bradley: Free\n   - Teresa: Busy (12:00 - 12:30)\n   - Elizabeth: Free\n   - Christian: Busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n8. **12:30 - 13:00**:\n   - Bradley: Busy (12:30 - 13:00)\n   - Teresa: Free (after 12:30)\n   - Elizabeth: Free (until 13:00)\n   - Christian: Busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n9. **13:00 - 13:30**:\n   - Bradley: Free (after 13:00, next busy at 13:30)\n   - Teresa: Busy (13:00 - 13:30)\n   - Elizabeth: Busy (13:00 - 13:30)\n   - Christian: Busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n10. **13:30 - 14:00**:\n    - Bradley: Busy (13:30 - 14:00)\n    - Teresa: Free\n    - Elizabeth: Free (after 13:30)\n    - Christian: Busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n11. **14:00 - 14:30**:\n    - Bradley: Free\n    - Teresa: Free\n    - Elizabeth: Free\n    - Christian: Busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n12. **14:30 - 15:00**:\n    - Bradley: Free\n    - Teresa: Busy (14:30 - 15:00)\n    - Elizabeth: Busy (14:30 - 15:00)\n    - Christian: Busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n13. **15:00 - 15:30**:\n    - Bradley: Free\n    - Teresa: Free\n    - Elizabeth: Free (until 15:30)\n    - Christian: Busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n14. **15:30 - 16:00**:\n    - Bradley: Busy (15:30 - 16:00)\n    - Teresa: Free\n    - Elizabeth: Busy (15:30 - 17:00)\n    - Christian: Busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n15. **16:00 - 16:30**:\n    - Bradley: Free\n    - Teresa: Free\n    - Elizabeth: Busy\n    - Christian: Busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n16. **16:30 - 17:00**:\n    - Bradley: Free\n    - Teresa: Free\n    - Elizabeth: Busy\n    - Christian: Busy\n    - **Not available**\n\nFrom the above, the only time slot where all four participants are free is **10:00 - 10:30**.\n\nLet me double-check this:\n\n- **Bradley**: Free at 10:00 - 10:30 (no overlap with his busy times)\n- **Teresa**: Free at 10:00 - 10:30 (next meeting at 10:30)\n- **Elizabeth**: Free at 10:00 - 10:30 (next meeting at 10:30)\n- **Christian**: Free until 10:30, so 10:00 - 10:30 is free\n\nYes, this checks out!\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"10:00:10:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
