We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday where both Nicole and Ruth are free, and also respect Ruth's preference not to meet on Wednesday after 13:30.\n\n### Understanding the Busy Times\n\nFirst, let's list out the busy times for both Nicole and Ruth on each day.\n\n#### Nicole's Busy Times:\n- **Monday:**\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 13:00 - 13:30\n  - 14:30 - 15:30\n- **Tuesday:**\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 11:30 - 13:30\n  - 14:30 - 15:30\n- **Wednesday:**\n  - 10:00 - 11:00\n  - 12:30 - 15:00\n  - 16:00 - 17:00\n\n#### Ruth's Busy Times:\n- **Monday:**\n  - 9:00 - 17:00 (entire day)\n- **Tuesday:**\n  - 9:00 - 17:00 (entire day)\n- **Wednesday:**\n  - 9:00 - 10:30\n  - 11:00 - 11:30\n  - 12:00 - 12:30\n  - 13:30 - 15:30\n  - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n### Analyzing Each Day\n\n**Monday:**\n- Nicole has some busy slots, but Ruth is busy the entire day (9:00 - 17:00).\n- **Conclusion:** No available time on Monday.\n\n**Tuesday:**\n- Nicole has some busy slots, but Ruth is busy the entire day (9:00 - 17:00).\n- **Conclusion:** No available time on Tuesday.\n\n**Wednesday:**\nThis is the only day left where both might have overlapping free times. Let's look closely.\n\n**Nicole's Wednesday Busy:**\n- 10:00 - 11:00\n- 12:30 - 15:00\n- 16:00 - 17:00\n\n**Ruth's Wednesday Busy:**\n- 9:00 - 10:30\n- 11:00 - 11:30\n- 12:00 - 12:30\n- 13:30 - 15:30\n- 16:00 - 16:30\n\n**Ruth's Preference:**\n- Doesn't want to meet after 13:30 on Wednesday. So, we can only consider times before 13:30.\n\nNow, let's find the free times for both before 13:30 on Wednesday.\n\n**Nicole's Free Times on Wednesday before 13:30:**\n- From 9:00 to 10:00 (but overlaps with Ruth's busy 9:00 - 10:30)\n- From 10:00 - 11:00 (Nicole is busy)\n- From 11:00 - 11:30 (Ruth is busy)\n- From 11:30 - 12:00 (both free? Let's check:\n  - Nicole: free after 11:00 until 12:30 (but 10:00-11:00 is busy, then free until 12:30)\n  - Ruth: 11:30 - 12:00 is free (since busy at 11:00-11:30, then free until 12:00)\nWait, no:\nActually, Nicole is busy 10:00-11:00, then free until 12:30.\nRuth is busy 9:00-10:30, then 11:00-11:30, then 12:00-12:30.\nSo Ruth's free before 13:30:\n- 10:30 - 11:00\n- 11:30 - 12:00\n\nNow, Nicole's free before 13:30:\n- 9:00 - 10:00 (but overlaps with Ruth's 9:00-10:30)\n- 11:00 - 12:30 (but within this, 11:00-12:30)\nBut Ruth is free:\n- 10:30 - 11:00\n  - Nicole is busy 10:00 - 11:00, so no overlap.\n- 11:30 - 12:00\n  - Nicole is free 11:00 - 12:30, so 11:30 - 12:00 is free for both.\n\nCheck if 11:30 - 12:00 is 30 minutes: yes.\n\nAlso, Ruth doesn't want to meet after 13:30, and this is before that.\n\n**Alternative Check:**\nIs there any other slot before 13:30?\n- 10:30 - 11:00: Nicole is busy (10:00-11:00), so no.\n- 11:30 - 12:00: both free.\n- 12:00 - 12:30: Ruth is busy.\nSo only 11:30 - 12:00 works.\n\n### Verifying the Slot:\n- **Nicole:**\n  - Wednesday: busy 10:00-11:00, then free until 12:30.\n  - 11:30 - 12:00: free.\n- **Ruth:**\n  - Wednesday: busy until 10:30, then 11:00-11:30, then free until 12:00.\n  - 11:30 - 12:00: free.\n- **Preference:** Before 13:30: yes.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"11:30:12:00\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```",
