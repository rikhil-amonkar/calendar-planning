We need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 where Denise, Angela, and Natalie are all available. \n\n### Understanding Each Person's Schedule:\n\n1. **Denise's Busy Times on Monday:**\n   - 12:00 to 12:30\n   - 15:30 to 16:00\n\n2. **Angela's Busy Times on Monday:**\n   - No meetings the whole day. So, Angela is free from 9:00 to 17:00.\n\n3. **Natalie's Busy Times on Monday:**\n   - 9:00 to 11:30\n   - 12:00 to 13:00\n   - 14:00 to 14:30\n   - 15:00 to 17:00\n\n### Determining Available Time Slots:\n\nFirst, let's list out the times when each person is busy, and then find the overlapping free times.\n\n**Denise's Free Times:**\n- Before 12:00\n- Between 12:30 and 15:30\n- After 16:00\n\nBut since the meeting must end by 17:00, and it's 30 minutes, the latest it can start is 16:30.\n\n**Angela's Free Times:**\n- Entire day (9:00 to 17:00)\n\n**Natalie's Free Times:**\n- After 11:30 to before 12:00 (but only 30 minutes, so 11:30 to 12:00)\n- After 13:00 to before 14:00\n- After 14:30 to before 15:00\n\nNow, let's find overlaps where all three are free.\n\n1. **11:30 to 12:00:**\n   - Denise: Free (before 12:00)\n   - Angela: Free\n   - Natalie: Free (11:30 to 12:00)\n   - But Denise has a meeting at 12:00, so 11:30-12:00 is okay (ends at 12:00, doesn't overlap with Denise's 12:00 meeting)\n   - However, Natalie is busy at 12:00, but the meeting ends at 12:00, so it's okay (not overlapping with her 12:00 meeting)\n   - So, 11:30-12:00 is possible.\n\n2. **13:00 to 14:00:**\n   - Denise is free (12:30 to 15:30)\n   - Angela is free\n   - Natalie is free from 13:00 to 14:00\n   - Possible slots:\n     - 13:00-13:30\n     - 13:30-14:00\n\n3. **14:30 to 15:00:**\n   - Denise is free\n   - Angela is free\n   - Natalie is free from 14:30 to 15:00\n   - Possible slot: 14:30-15:00\n\n### Choosing the Earliest Available Time:\n\nThe group prefers the earliest availability. Let's list the possible slots in order:\n\n1. 11:30-12:00\n2. 13:00-13:30\n3. 13:30-14:00\n4. 14:30-15:00\n\nThe earliest is 11:30-12:00.\n\n### Verifying 11:30-12:00:\n\n- Denise: Not busy (her first meeting is at 12:00)\n- Angela: Free\n- Natalie: Free from 11:30 to 12:00 (her meeting ends at 11:30, next at 12:00)\n  \nNo overlaps with any busy times. This slot works.\n\n### Checking if There's an Earlier Slot:\n\nThe next possible earlier time would be before 11:30, but:\n\n- Natalie is busy from 9:00 to 11:30, so no earlier slots are possible.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nThe earliest available 30-minute slot where all three are free is **11:30 to 12:00 on Monday**.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"11:30:12:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
