We need to find a one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 (that's 9 AM to 5 PM) on either Monday or Tuesday where both Gary and David are available. \n\nFirst, let's list out the blocked times for both Gary and David on both days, and then see where their free times overlap for a full hour.\n\n### Monday:\n\n**Gary's blocked times on Monday:**\n1. 9:30 - 10:00\n2. 11:00 - 13:00\n3. 14:00 - 14:30\n4. 16:30 - 17:00\n\n**David's blocked times on Monday:**\n1. 9:00 - 9:30\n2. 10:00 - 13:00\n3. 14:30 - 16:30\n\nNow, let's figure out the free times for each on Monday by subtracting the blocked times from the work hours (9:00 - 17:00).\n\n**Gary's free times on Monday:**\n- Start at 9:00\n  - Blocked 9:30 - 10:00: so free from 9:00 - 9:30\n  - Then next block at 11:00, so from 10:00 - 11:00\n  - Then blocked till 13:00, so next free from 13:00 - 14:00\n  - Then blocked 14:00 - 14:30, so next free from 14:30 - 16:30\n  - Then blocked 16:30 - 17:00, so next free would be after, but work ends at 17:00\nSo free slots:\n1. 9:00 - 9:30\n2. 10:00 - 11:00\n3. 13:00 - 14:00\n4. 14:30 - 16:30\n\n**David's free times on Monday:**\n- Start at 9:00\n  - Blocked 9:00 - 9:30: so free starts at 9:30\n  - Then blocked 10:00 - 13:00: so free from 9:30 - 10:00\n  - Then blocked till 13:00, so next free from 13:00 - 14:30\n  - Then blocked 14:30 - 16:30, so next free from 16:30 - 17:00\nSo free slots:\n1. 9:30 - 10:00\n2. 13:00 - 14:30\n3. 16:30 - 17:00\n\nNow, let's find overlaps where both are free on Monday:\n\n- Gary: 9:00 - 9:30; David: 9:30 - 10:00 \u2192 overlap at 9:30, but only for 0 minutes (since Gary's ends at 9:30 and David's starts at 9:30)\n- Gary: 10:00 - 11:00; David: 9:30 - 10:00 \u2192 overlap from 10:00 - 10:00 (0 minutes)\n- Gary: 13:00 - 14:00; David: 13:00 - 14:30 \u2192 overlap from 13:00 - 14:00 (1 hour)\n- Gary: 14:30 - 16:30; David: 16:30 - 17:00 \u2192 overlap at 16:30 (0 minutes)\n\nSo the only overlapping one-hour slot on Monday is **13:00 - 14:00**.\n\nBut let's check Tuesday to see if there are other options.\n\n### Tuesday:\n\n**Gary's blocked times on Tuesday:**\n1. 9:00 - 9:30\n2. 10:30 - 11:00\n3. 14:30 - 16:00\n\n**David's blocked times on Tuesday:**\n1. 9:00 - 9:30\n2. 10:00 - 10:30\n3. 11:00 - 12:30\n4. 13:00 - 14:30\n5. 15:00 - 16:00\n6. 16:30 - 17:00\n\nNow, let's find free times for each on Tuesday.\n\n**Gary's free times on Tuesday:**\n- Start at 9:00\n  - Blocked 9:00 - 9:30: free starts at 9:30\n  - Next block at 10:30 - 11:00: so free from 9:30 - 10:30\n  - Then blocked 10:30 - 11:00: so next free from 11:00 - 14:30\n  - Then blocked 14:30 - 16:00: so next free from 16:00 - 17:00\nSo free slots:\n1. 9:30 - 10:30\n2. 11:00 - 14:30\n3. 16:00 - 17:00\n\n**David's free times on Tuesday:**\n- Start at 9:00\n  - Blocked 9:00 - 9:30: free starts at 9:30\n  - Next block at 10:00 - 10:30: so free from 9:30 - 10:00\n  - Then blocked till 10:30, next free from 10:30 - 11:00\n  - Then blocked 11:00 - 12:30: next free from 12:30 - 13:00\n  - Then blocked 13:00 - 14:30: next free from 14:30 - 15:00\n  - Then blocked 15:00 - 16:00: next free from 16:00 - 16:30\n  - Then blocked 16:30 - 17:00\nSo free slots:\n1. 9:30 - 10:00\n2. 10:30 - 11:00\n3. 12:30 - 13:00\n4. 14:30 - 15:00\n5. 16:00 - 16:30\n\nNow, find overlaps where both are free on Tuesday:\n\n- Gary: 9:30 - 10:30; David: 9:30 - 10:00 \u2192 overlap 9:30 - 10:00 (30 minutes)\n- Gary: 9:30 - 10:30; David: 10:30 - 11:00 \u2192 overlap at 10:30 (0 minutes)\n- Gary: 11:00 - 14:30; David: 12:30 - 13:00 \u2192 overlap 12:30 - 13:00 (30 minutes)\n- Gary: 11:00 - 14:30; David: 14:30 - 15:00 \u2192 overlap at 14:30 (0 minutes)\n- Gary: 16:00 - 17:00; David: 16:00 - 16:30 \u2192 overlap 16:00 - 16:30 (30 minutes)\n\nOn Tuesday, the overlapping free times are all less than one hour, so no suitable slot here.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only one-hour slot where both Gary and David are free is on Monday from 13:00 to 14:00.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"13:00:14:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
