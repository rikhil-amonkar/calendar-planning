I'll go through each day and check for available one-hour slots where both Diane and Matthew are free, while also considering Matthew's preference to not meet on Wednesday before 12:30.\n\n### Understanding the Constraints\n\n**Work Hours:** 9:00 to 17:00 (5:00 PM) each day.\n\n**Participants:**\n- Diane\n- Matthew\n\n**Meeting Duration:** 1 hour.\n\n**Days to Consider:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n**Matthew's Preference:** Avoid Wednesday before 12:30.\n\n### Analyzing Each Day\n\n#### Monday:\n- **Diane's Busy Times:**\n  - 12:00 - 12:30\n  - 15:00 - 15:30\n  - (Other times are free within 9:00-17:00)\n  \n- **Matthew's Busy Times:**\n  - 9:00 - 10:00\n  - 10:30 - 17:00\n  - So, free times: 10:00 - 10:30\n  \n  But 10:00-10:30 is only 30 minutes, not enough for a 1-hour meeting. So, no slot on Monday.\n\n#### Tuesday:\n- **Diane's Busy Times:**\n  - 10:00 - 11:00\n  - 11:30 - 12:00\n  - 12:30 - 13:00\n  - 16:00 - 17:00\n  \n  Free blocks:\n  - 9:00 - 10:00\n  - 11:00 - 11:30\n  - 12:00 - 12:30\n  - 13:00 - 16:00\n  \n- **Matthew's Busy Times:**\n  - 9:00 - 17:00 (entire day)\n  \n  No overlap with Diane's free times. So, no slot on Tuesday.\n\n#### Wednesday:\n- **Matthew's Preference:** Avoid before 12:30.\n  \n- **Diane's Busy Times:**\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 14:30 - 15:00\n  - 16:30 - 17:00\n  \n  Free blocks:\n  - 9:30 - 14:30 (but after 12:30 is fine)\n  - 15:00 - 16:30\n  \n- **Matthew's Busy Times:**\n  - 9:00 - 11:00\n  - 12:00 - 14:30\n  - 16:00 - 17:00\n  \n  Free blocks:\n  - 11:00 - 12:00\n  - 14:30 - 16:00\n  \n  Considering Matthew's preference to avoid before 12:30, let's look after 12:30:\n  \n  - 14:30 - 16:00 is free for Matthew.\n  \n  Now, Diane's free times after 12:30:\n  - 12:30 - 14:30 (but Matthew is busy 12:00-14:30, so only from 14:30)\n  - 15:00 - 16:30\n  \n  Overlapping free times:\n  - 14:30 - 15:00: But Diane is free at 14:30-15:00, but Matthew is free 14:30-16:00. However, Diane is busy 14:30-15:00, so this is not free for Diane. Wait, no: Diane's busy is 14:30-15:00, so she's free after 15:00.\n  \n  So, possible overlaps:\n  - 15:00 - 16:00:\n    - Diane: free 15:00 - 16:30\n    - Matthew: free 14:30 - 16:00\n    - So both free 15:00 - 16:00\n  \n  This is a 1-hour slot.\n\n#### Thursday:\nJust for completeness, let's check Thursday.\n\n- **Diane's Busy Times:**\n  - 15:30 - 16:30\n  \n  Free blocks:\n  - 9:00 - 15:30\n  - 16:30 - 17:00\n  \n- **Matthew's Busy Times:**\n  - 9:00 - 16:00\n  \n  Free blocks:\n  - 16:00 - 17:00\n  \n  Overlapping free times:\n  - 16:00 - 16:30: But Diane is busy until 16:30, so no overlap.\n  \n  No valid slot on Thursday.\n\n#### Friday:\n- **Diane's Busy Times:**\n  - 9:30 - 11:30\n  - 14:30 - 15:00\n  - 16:00 - 17:00\n  \n  Free blocks:\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 11:30 - 14:30\n  - 15:00 - 16:00\n  \n- **Matthew's Busy Times:**\n  - 9:00 - 17:00 (entire day)\n  \n  No overlap. No slot on Friday.\n\n### Verifying Wednesday's Slot\n\nFrom Wednesday, the potential slot is 15:00 - 16:00.\n\n- **Diane:**\n  - Busy: 14:30-15:00, 16:30-17:00\n  - So, free at 15:00-16:30\n- **Matthew:**\n  - Busy: 16:00-17:00\n  - Free: 14:30-16:00\n- Overlap: 15:00-16:00\n\nThis fits all constraints, including Matthew's preference to avoid Wednesday before 12:30.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"15:00:16:00\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```",
