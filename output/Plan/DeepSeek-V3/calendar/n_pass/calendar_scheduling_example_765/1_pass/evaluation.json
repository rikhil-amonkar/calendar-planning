I'll go through each day and see if there's a suitable 30-minute slot where both Joshua and Joyce are free, considering Joyce's preference to not meet on Monday before 12:00 and her unavailability on Tuesday.\n\n### Given:\n- **Participants**: Joshua and Joyce\n- **Meeting Duration**: 30 minutes\n- **Work Hours**: 9:00 to 17:00\n- **Days to Consider**: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday\n- **Preferences**: Joyce would rather not meet on Monday before 12:00. Also, Joyce is busy all day Tuesday.\n\n### Existing Schedules:\n\n**Joshua's Busy Times:**\n- Monday: 15:00 - 15:30\n- Tuesday: 11:30 - 12:00, 13:00 - 13:30, 14:30 - 15:00\n- Wednesday: (No busy times mentioned, so free all day within work hours)\n\n**Joyce's Busy Times:**\n- Monday: \n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 10:00 - 11:00\n  - 11:30 - 12:30\n  - 13:00 - 15:00\n  - 15:30 - 17:00\n- Tuesday: 9:00 - 17:00 (entire day busy)\n- Wednesday:\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 10:00 - 11:00\n  - 12:30 - 15:30\n  - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n### Analyzing Each Day:\n\n#### Monday:\nJoshua's busy: 15:00 - 15:30\nJoyce's busy:\n- 9:00 - 9:30\n- 10:00 - 11:00\n- 11:30 - 12:30\n- 13:00 - 15:00\n- 15:30 - 17:00\n\nJoyce's preference: Not before 12:00 on Monday.\n\nSo, possible times after 12:00 on Monday:\n\nBetween 12:30 - 13:00:\n- Joshua: Free\n- Joyce: Busy until 12:30, then free until 13:00\nBut Joyce is busy from 13:00 - 15:00, and Joshua is free until 15:00 except 15:00 - 15:30.\n\nNext possible after 15:00:\nJoshua is free after 15:30.\nJoyce is busy until 17:00.\nNo overlap after 15:30.\n\nSo, only possible is 12:30 - 13:00, but Joyce prefers not before 12:00, and this is after 12:00, but let's check:\n- 12:30 - 13:00:\n  - Joshua: Free\n  - Joyce: Free from 12:30 - 13:00\nThis seems okay, but let's see other days first.\n\n#### Tuesday:\nJoyce is busy all day, so Tuesday is out.\n\n#### Wednesday:\nJoshua: Free all day (no busy times)\nJoyce's busy:\n- 9:00 - 9:30\n- 10:00 - 11:00\n- 12:30 - 15:30\n- 16:00 - 16:30\n\nPossible free slots for Joyce:\n- 9:30 - 10:00\n- 11:00 - 12:30\n- 15:30 - 16:00\n- 16:30 - 17:00\n\nNow, find 30-minute slots where both are free:\n1. 9:30 - 10:00:\n   - Joshua: Free\n   - Joyce: Free\n2. 11:00 - 12:30:\n   - Could do 11:00 - 11:30 or 11:30 - 12:00 or 12:00 - 12:30\n   - All are free for both\n3. 15:30 - 16:00:\n   - Joshua: Free\n   - Joyce: Free\n4. 16:30 - 17:00:\n   - Joshua: Free\n   - Joyce: Free\n\nSo, multiple options on Wednesday.\n\n### Considering Preferences:\nJoyce would rather not meet on Monday before 12:00, but the Monday option is 12:30 - 13:00, which is after 12:00, so it's acceptable. However, Wednesday has more options and no preferences against it.\n\nPossible Wednesday slots:\n- 9:30 - 10:00\n- 11:00 - 11:30\n- 11:30 - 12:00\n- 12:00 - 12:30\n- 15:30 - 16:00\n- 16:30 - 17:00\n\nAny of these would work. The earliest one is 9:30 - 10:00.\n\n### Final Decision:\nBetween Monday's 12:30 - 13:00 and Wednesday's multiple options, Wednesday seems better since it's not on Monday which Joyce prefers to avoid before 12:00 (even though the Monday slot is after 12:00). \n\nLet's pick the first available on Wednesday: 9:30 - 10:00.\n\n### Verification:\n- Joshua on Wednesday 9:30 - 10:00: Free\n- Joyce on Wednesday 9:30 - 10:00: Free (busy 9:00 - 9:30 and next busy at 10:00)\n  \nPerfect fit.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"09:30:10:00\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```",
