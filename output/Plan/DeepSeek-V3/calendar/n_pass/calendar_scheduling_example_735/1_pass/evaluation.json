We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday where both Ronald and Amber are free. The group prefers the earliest available time, so we'll look for the first possible slot that fits.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's summarize the blocked times for both Ronald and Amber on each day.\n\n#### Monday:\n- **Ronald's blocked times:**\n  - 10:30 - 11:00\n  - 12:00 - 12:30\n  - 15:30 - 16:00\n- **Amber's blocked times:**\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 10:00 - 10:30\n  - 11:30 - 12:00\n  - 12:30 - 14:00\n  - 14:30 - 15:00\n  - 15:30 - 17:00\n\n#### Tuesday:\n- **Ronald's blocked times:**\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 12:00 - 12:30\n  - 15:30 - 16:30\n- **Amber's blocked times:**\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 10:00 - 11:30\n  - 12:00 - 12:30\n  - 13:30 - 15:30\n  - 16:30 - 17:00\n\n#### Wednesday:\n- **Ronald's blocked times:**\n  - 9:30 - 10:30\n  - 11:00 - 12:00\n  - 12:30 - 13:00\n  - 13:30 - 14:00\n  - 16:30 - 17:00\n- **Amber's blocked times:**\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 10:00 - 10:30\n  - 11:00 - 13:30\n  - 15:00 - 15:30\n\n### Finding Available Slots\n\nWe'll go through each day to find the earliest 30-minute window where both are free.\n\n#### Monday:\nWork hours: 9:00 - 17:00\n\nLet's list the free times by subtracting blocked times from the work hours.\n\n- **Ronald's free periods on Monday:**\n  - 9:00 - 10:30\n  - 11:00 - 12:00\n  - 12:30 - 15:30\n  - 16:00 - 17:00\n\n- **Amber's free periods on Monday:**\n  - 9:30 - 10:00\n  - 10:30 - 11:30\n  - 12:00 - 12:30\n  - 14:00 - 14:30\n  - 15:00 - 15:30\n\nNow, find overlaps between Ronald's and Amber's free times.\n\n1. 9:30 - 10:00 (Amber) overlaps with 9:00 - 10:30 (Ronald) \u2192 9:30 - 10:00\n   - But Amber is blocked 10:00 - 10:30, so no extension.\n   - Possible: 9:30 - 10:00\n2. 10:30 - 11:30 (Amber) overlaps with 11:00 - 12:00 (Ronald) \u2192 11:00 - 11:30\n   - But Amber is blocked 11:30 - 12:00, so 11:00 - 11:30 is free for both.\n3. 12:00 - 12:30 (Amber) overlaps with 12:00 - 12:30 (Ronald), but Ronald is blocked 12:00 - 12:30. Wait no, Ronald is blocked 12:00 - 12:30, so this is not free.\n4. 14:00 - 14:30 (Amber) overlaps with 12:30 - 15:30 (Ronald) \u2192 14:00 - 14:30\n5. 15:00 - 15:30 (Amber) overlaps with 12:30 - 15:30 (Ronald) \u2192 15:00 - 15:30\n\nEarliest possible on Monday:\n- 9:30 - 10:00\n\nCheck if both are free:\n- Ronald: 9:00 - 10:30 is free except 10:30 - 11:00, so 9:30 - 10:00 is free.\n- Amber: 9:30 - 10:00 is free.\n\nSo, Monday 9:30 - 10:00 is a possible slot.\n\nBut let's check other days to see if there's an earlier slot.\n\n#### Tuesday:\nWork hours: 9:00 - 17:00\n\n- **Ronald's free periods on Tuesday:**\n  - 9:30 - 12:00 (except 12:00 - 12:30)\n    - Actually, blocked: 9:00 - 9:30, 12:00 - 12:30, 15:30 - 16:30\n    - So free: 9:30 - 12:00, 12:30 - 15:30, 16:30 - 17:00\n- **Amber's free periods on Tuesday:**\n  - 9:30 - 10:00 (after 9:00 - 9:30)\n  - 11:30 - 12:00\n  - 12:30 - 13:30\n  - 15:30 - 16:30\n  - But 15:30 - 16:30 is blocked for Ronald, so ignore.\n  \nOverlaps:\n1. 9:30 - 10:00 (Amber) overlaps with 9:30 - 12:00 (Ronald) \u2192 9:30 - 10:00\n   - But Amber is blocked 10:00 - 11:30, so next is after 11:30.\n2. 11:30 - 12:00 (Amber) overlaps with 9:30 - 12:00 (Ronald) \u2192 11:30 - 12:00\n3. 12:30 - 13:30 (Amber) overlaps with 12:30 - 15:30 (Ronald) \u2192 12:30 - 13:30\n\nEarliest on Tuesday:\n- 9:30 - 10:00\n\nCheck:\n- Ronald: free 9:30 - 12:00\n- Amber: free 9:30 - 10:00\nSo, 9:30 - 10:00 is free for both.\n\nSame as Monday's earliest. Let's check Wednesday for an earlier slot.\n\n#### Wednesday:\nWork hours: 9:00 - 17:00\n\n- **Ronald's free periods on Wednesday:**\n  - Blocked: 9:30 - 10:30, 11:00 - 12:00, 12:30 - 13:00, 13:30 - 14:00, 16:30 - 17:00\n  - So free:\n    - 9:00 - 9:30\n    - 10:30 - 11:00\n    - 12:00 - 12:30\n    - 13:00 - 13:30\n    - 14:00 - 16:30\n- **Amber's free periods on Wednesday:**\n  - Blocked: 9:00 - 9:30, 10:00 - 10:30, 11:00 - 13:30, 15:00 - 15:30\n  - So free:\n    - 9:30 - 10:00\n    - 10:30 - 11:00\n    - 13:30 - 15:00\n    - 15:30 - 17:00\n\nOverlaps:\n1. 9:30 - 10:00 (Amber) overlaps with 9:00 - 9:30 (Ronald) \u2192 no overlap (Ronald is free 9:00 - 9:30, Amber is free 9:30 - 10:00)\n   - Overlap is at 9:30, but only for a moment, not 30 mins.\n2. 10:30 - 11:00 (Amber) overlaps with 10:30 - 11:00 (Ronald) \u2192 10:30 - 11:00\n3. 13:30 - 15:00 (Amber) overlaps with 14:00 - 16:30 (Ronald) \u2192 14:00 - 15:00\n   - But Amber is blocked 15:00 - 15:30, so 14:00 - 15:00 is free.\n4. 15:30 - 17:00 (Amber) overlaps with 14:00 - 16:30 (Ronald) \u2192 15:30 - 16:30\n\nEarliest on Wednesday:\n- 10:30 - 11:00\n\nBut Monday and Tuesday have 9:30 - 10:00, which is earlier than Wednesday's 10:30 - 11:00.\n\n### Comparing All Days\n\nEarliest slots:\n- Monday: 9:30 - 10:00\n- Tuesday: 9:30 - 10:00\n- Wednesday: 10:30 - 11:00\n\nBoth Monday and Tuesday have the same earliest slot at 9:30 - 10:00. Since the group prefers the earliest availability, and both days offer the same earliest time, we can choose either. Typically, we'd pick the earliest day in the week, which is Monday.\n\n### Verifying Monday 9:30 - 10:00\n\n- **Ronald on Monday:**\n  - Blocked: 10:30 - 11:00, 12:00 - 12:30, 15:30 - 16:00\n  - So 9:30 - 10:00 is free.\n- **Amber on Monday:**\n  - Blocked: 9:00 - 9:30, 10:00 - 10:30, etc.\n  - Free at 9:30 - 10:00.\n\nBoth are free at this time.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"09:30:10:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
