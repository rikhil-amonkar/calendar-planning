I'm going to find a one-hour time slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 where both Kayla and Rebecca are available. \n\n### Understanding the Schedules\n\nFirst, let's list out the blocked times for both Kayla and Rebecca on Monday.\n\n**Kayla's blocked times on Monday:**\n1. 10:00 to 10:30\n2. 14:30 to 16:00\n\n**Rebecca's blocked times on Monday:**\n1. 9:00 to 13:00\n2. 13:30 to 15:00\n3. 15:30 to 16:00\n\n### Visualizing the Blocked Times\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the blocked times for both:\n\n**Kayla's Availability:**\n- 9:00 - 10:00: Available\n- 10:00 - 10:30: Blocked\n- 10:30 - 14:30: Available\n- 14:30 - 16:00: Blocked\n- 16:00 - 17:00: Available\n\n**Rebecca's Availability:**\n- 9:00 - 13:00: Blocked\n- 13:00 - 13:30: Available\n- 13:30 - 15:00: Blocked\n- 15:00 - 15:30: Available\n- 15:30 - 16:00: Blocked\n- 16:00 - 17:00: Available\n\n### Finding Overlapping Available Times\n\nNow, let's find the time slots where both are available simultaneously.\n\n1. **9:00 - 10:00:**\n   - Kayla: Available\n   - Rebecca: Blocked (until 13:00)\n   - **Not available**\n\n2. **10:00 - 10:30:**\n   - Kayla: Blocked\n   - Rebecca: Blocked\n   - **Not available**\n\n3. **10:30 - 13:00:**\n   - Kayla: Available\n   - Rebecca: Blocked\n   - **Not available**\n\n4. **13:00 - 13:30:**\n   - Kayla: Available\n   - Rebecca: Available\n   - **Potential slot: 13:00 - 14:00**\n     - But we need a full hour from 13:00 - 14:00.\n     - Rebecca is available from 13:00 - 13:30 (only 30 minutes), then blocked until 15:00.\n     - So 13:00 - 14:00 is not fully available for Rebecca (blocked from 13:30).\n   - **Not available for full hour**\n\n5. **14:30 - 15:00:**\n   - Kayla: Blocked\n   - Rebecca: Blocked\n   - **Not available**\n\n6. **15:00 - 15:30:**\n   - Kayla: Blocked (until 16:00)\n   - Rebecca: Available\n   - **Not available**\n\n7. **16:00 - 17:00:**\n   - Kayla: Available\n   - Rebecca: Available\n   - **Potential slot: 16:00 - 17:00**\n\n### Checking the Potential Slot: 16:00 - 17:00\n\nLet's verify:\n- Kayla:\n  - 16:00 - 17:00: Not blocked (last blocked until 16:00, then free)\n- Rebecca:\n  - 16:00 - 17:00: Not blocked (last blocked until 16:00, then free)\n\nBoth are free from 16:00 to 17:00, which is a full hour.\n\n### Are There Other Possible Slots?\n\nLet me check if there's any other one-hour slot where both are available.\n\n- Between 10:30 - 14:30 for Kayla:\n  - Rebecca is blocked until 13:00, then 13:00 - 13:30 is available but not a full hour.\n  - After 13:30, Rebecca is blocked until 15:00.\n  \n- After 15:30:\n  - Kayla is blocked until 16:00.\n  - Rebecca is blocked until 16:00.\n  - Then both are free from 16:00 - 17:00.\n\nNo other full one-hour slots seem available where both are free.\n\n### Final Available Slot\n\nThe only one-hour slot where both Kayla and Rebecca are available on Monday is:\n\n**16:00 - 17:00**\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"16:00:17:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
