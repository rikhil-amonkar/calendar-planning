We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for all of them, considering their existing schedules and Megan's preference to avoid meetings before 10:00.\n\n### Step 1: List Everyone's Busy Times\nFirst, let's list out the busy times for each person on Monday:\n\n1. **Kimberly**:\n   - 10:00 - 10:30\n   - 11:00 - 12:00\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n2. **Megan**:\n   - No meetings all day (free the whole day from 9:00 - 17:00)\n   - Preference: Avoid meetings before 10:00\n\n3. **Marie**:\n   - 10:00 - 11:00\n   - 11:30 - 15:00\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n4. **Diana**:\n   - 9:30 - 10:00\n   - 10:30 - 14:30\n   - 15:30 - 17:00\n\n### Step 2: Understand Available Time Slots\nWe need to find a 30-minute window where none of the participants are busy, and it's after 10:00 due to Megan's preference.\n\nLet's break down the day from 10:00 onwards in 30-minute increments and see where everyone is free.\n\n#### Potential Time Slots to Check:\n\n1. **10:00 - 10:30**:\n   - Kimberly: Busy (10:00 - 10:30)\n   - Marie: Busy (10:00 - 11:00)\n   - Diana: Busy until 10:00, then from 10:30 - 14:30\n   - Megan: Free\n   - **Conflict**: Kimberly and Marie are busy.\n\n2. **10:30 - 11:00**:\n   - Kimberly: Free (her next meeting is at 11:00)\n   - Marie: Busy until 11:00\n   - Diana: Busy (10:30 - 14:30)\n   - Megan: Free\n   - **Conflict**: Marie and Diana are busy.\n\n3. **11:00 - 11:30**:\n   - Kimberly: Busy (11:00 - 12:00)\n   - Marie: Busy until 11:30 (from 11:30 - 15:00)\n   - Diana: Busy (10:30 - 14:30)\n   - Megan: Free\n   - **Conflict**: Kimberly, Marie, Diana are busy.\n\n4. **11:30 - 12:00**:\n   - Kimberly: Busy (11:00 - 12:00)\n   - Marie: Busy (11:30 - 15:00)\n   - Diana: Busy (10:30 - 14:30)\n   - Megan: Free\n   - **Conflict**: Kimberly, Marie, Diana are busy.\n\n5. **12:00 - 12:30**:\n   - Kimberly: Free (last meeting ended at 12:00)\n   - Marie: Busy (11:30 - 15:00)\n   - Diana: Busy (10:30 - 14:30)\n   - Megan: Free\n   - **Conflict**: Marie and Diana are busy.\n\n6. **12:30 - 13:00**:\n   - Same as above, Marie and Diana are busy until 14:30.\n\n7. **13:00 - 13:30**:\n   - Same as above.\n\n8. **13:30 - 14:00**:\n   - Same as above.\n\n9. **14:00 - 14:30**:\n   - Same as above.\n\n10. **14:30 - 15:00**:\n    - Kimberly: Free\n    - Marie: Busy until 15:00\n    - Diana: Free (from 14:30, next busy at 15:30)\n    - Megan: Free\n    - **Conflict**: Marie is busy.\n\n11. **15:00 - 15:30**:\n    - Kimberly: Free\n    - Marie: Free (last meeting ended at 15:00)\n    - Diana: Free (until 15:30)\n    - Megan: Free\n    - **All Free**: This slot looks good!\n\n    Let's verify:\n    - Kimberly: No meetings between 12:00 - 16:00\n    - Marie: No meetings between 15:00 - 16:00\n    - Diana: No meetings between 14:30 - 15:30\n    - Megan: Free all day\n    - Megan's preference: After 10:00, which is satisfied.\n\n12. **15:30 - 16:00**:\n    - Kimberly: Free\n    - Marie: Free\n    - Diana: Busy (from 15:30)\n    - Megan: Free\n    - **Conflict**: Diana is busy.\n\n13. **16:00 - 16:30**:\n    - Kimberly: Busy (16:00 - 16:30)\n    - Marie: Busy (16:00 - 16:30)\n    - Diana: Busy (15:30 - 17:00)\n    - Megan: Free\n    - **Conflict**: All except Megan are busy.\n\n14. **16:30 - 17:00**:\n    - Kimberly: Free (last meeting ended at 16:30)\n    - Marie: Free (last meeting ended at 16:30)\n    - Diana: Busy (until 17:00)\n    - Megan: Free\n    - **Conflict**: Diana is busy.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Only Available Slot\nFrom the above, the only 30-minute slot where all four are free is **15:00 - 15:30**.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- **Kimberly**:\n  - Last meeting before this: 11:00 - 12:00\n  - Next meeting after this: 16:00 - 16:30\n  - Free from 12:00 - 16:00 \u2192 includes 15:00 - 15:30\n\n- **Marie**:\n  - Last meeting before this: 11:30 - 15:00\n  - Next meeting after this: 16:00 - 16:30\n  - Free from 15:00 - 16:00 \u2192 includes 15:00 - 15:30\n\n- **Diana**:\n  - Last meeting before this: 10:30 - 14:30\n  - Next meeting after this: 15:30 - 17:00\n  - Free from 14:30 - 15:30 \u2192 includes 15:00 - 15:30\n\n- **Megan**:\n  - Free all day, and after 10:00 is satisfied.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nThe only suitable time slot is from 15:00 to 15:30 on Monday.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"15:00:15:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
