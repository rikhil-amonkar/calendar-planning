    "execution_output": "Alright, let's tackle this scheduling problem step by step. We need to find a one-hour slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday where both Martha and Beverly are available. \n\nFirst, let's list out the blocked times for each person on each day, and then see where there's an overlap of free time.\n\n### Martha's Blocked Times:\n- **Monday**: 16:00 - 17:00\n- **Tuesday**: 15:00 - 15:30\n- **Wednesday**: 10:00 - 11:00, 14:00 - 14:30\n\n### Beverly's Blocked Times:\n- **Monday**: 9:00 - 13:30, 14:00 - 17:00\n- **Tuesday**: 9:00 - 17:00 (entire day)\n- **Wednesday**: 9:30 - 15:30, 16:30 - 17:00\n\nNow, let's examine each day one by one.\n\n#### Monday:\n- **Martha's free times**:\n  - Before 16:00: 9:00 - 16:00\n  - But since Beverly is blocked until 13:30 and then again from 14:00, let's see:\n    - Between 13:30 - 14:00: Beverly is free (only 30 minutes, but we need 1 hour)\n    - After 14:00, Beverly is blocked until 17:00.\n- **Possible slots**:\n  - 13:30 - 14:00 is only 30 minutes, so not enough.\n  - No other free overlaps for an hour.\n\n#### Tuesday:\n- **Beverly is entirely blocked** (9:00 - 17:00). So no possible slot here.\n\n#### Wednesday:\n- **Martha's free times**:\n  - 9:00 - 10:00\n  - 11:00 - 14:00\n  - 14:30 - 17:00\n- **Beverly's free times**:\n  - Before 9:30: 9:00 - 9:30 (only 30 minutes)\n  - Between 15:30 - 16:30 (since 16:30 - 17:00 is blocked)\n    - 15:30 - 16:30 is 1 hour\n- **Overlapping free times**:\n  - Martha is free from 14:30 - 17:00\n  - Beverly is free from 15:30 - 16:30\n  - Overlap: 15:30 - 16:30 (1 hour)\n  \nLet's check if this slot is free for both:\n- Martha on Wednesday:\n  - 10:00 - 11:00: blocked\n  - 14:00 - 14:30: blocked\n  - 15:30 - 16:30: not blocked\n- Beverly on Wednesday:\n  - 9:30 - 15:30: blocked\n  - 16:30 - 17:00: blocked\n  - 15:30 - 16:30: free\n\nPerfect! 15:30 - 16:30 on Wednesday works for both.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"15:30:16:30\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```",
