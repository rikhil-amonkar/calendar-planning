We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for all of them, considering their existing schedules and Roger's preference not to meet before 12:30.\n\n### Step 1: List Everyone's Busy Times\nFirst, let's list out when each person is busy on Monday:\n\n1. **Daniel**: Free all day.\n2. **Kathleen**: 14:30 - 15:30.\n3. **Carolyn**: 12:00 - 12:30, 13:00 - 13:30.\n4. **Roger**: Free all day, but prefers not before 12:30.\n5. **Cheryl**: \n   - 9:00 - 9:30,\n   - 10:00 - 11:30,\n   - 12:30 - 13:30,\n   - 14:00 - 17:00.\n6. **Virginia**: \n   - 9:30 - 11:30,\n   - 12:00 - 12:30,\n   - 13:00 - 13:30,\n   - 14:30 - 15:30,\n   - 16:00 - 17:00.\n7. **Angela**: \n   - 9:30 - 10:00,\n   - 10:30 - 11:30,\n   - 12:00 - 12:30,\n   - 13:00 - 13:30,\n   - 14:00 - 16:30.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Roger's Preference\nRoger is free all day but prefers not to meet before 12:30. So, we can ignore times before 12:30.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Possible Time Slots After 12:30\nNow, let's look at the time after 12:30 and see when everyone is free.\n\nLet's break down the afternoon into potential 30-minute slots and check availability:\n\n1. **12:30 - 13:00**:\n   - Carolyn: Free (her last busy is 12:00-12:30).\n   - Cheryl: Busy (12:30 - 13:30).\n   - Virginia: Free (last busy before this is 12:00-12:30).\n   - Angela: Busy (12:00-12:30, then next busy at 13:00).\n   - Kathleen: Free.\n   - Roger: Free.\n   - Daniel: Free.\n   - **Issue**: Cheryl is busy. So, this slot doesn't work.\n\n2. **13:00 - 13:30**:\n   - Carolyn: Busy (13:00 - 13:30).\n   - Cheryl: Busy (12:30 - 13:30).\n   - Virginia: Busy (13:00 - 13:30).\n   - Angela: Busy (13:00 - 13:30).\n   - **Multiple people busy**: Doesn't work.\n\n3. **13:30 - 14:00**:\n   - Carolyn: Free (last busy was 13:00-13:30).\n   - Cheryl: Free (last busy was 12:30-13:30).\n   - Virginia: Free (last busy was 13:00-13:30).\n   - Angela: Free (last busy was 13:00-13:30).\n   - Kathleen: Free.\n   - Roger: Free.\n   - Daniel: Free.\n   - **All free**: This looks promising!\n\n4. **14:00 - 14:30**:\n   - Cheryl: Busy (14:00 - 17:00).\n   - Angela: Busy (14:00 - 16:30).\n   - **Cheryl and Angela busy**: Doesn't work.\n\n5. **14:30 - 15:00**:\n   - Kathleen: Busy (14:30 - 15:30).\n   - Virginia: Busy (14:30 - 15:30).\n   - Cheryl: Busy (14:00 - 17:00).\n   - Angela: Busy (14:00 - 16:30).\n   - **Multiple busy**: Doesn't work.\n\n6. **15:00 - 15:30**:\n   - Same as above: Kathleen, Virginia, Cheryl, Angela busy.\n   - Doesn't work.\n\n7. **15:30 - 16:00**:\n   - Kathleen: Free (busy until 15:30).\n   - Virginia: Free (busy until 15:30, then next at 16:00).\n   - Cheryl: Busy (until 17:00).\n   - Angela: Busy (until 16:30).\n   - **Cheryl and Angela busy**: Doesn't work.\n\n8. **16:00 - 16:30**:\n   - Virginia: Busy (16:00 - 17:00).\n   - Cheryl: Busy (until 17:00).\n   - Angela: Busy (until 16:30).\n   - **Multiple busy**: Doesn't work.\n\n9. **16:30 - 17:00**:\n   - Angela: Free (busy until 16:30).\n   - Cheryl: Busy (until 17:00).\n   - Virginia: Busy (until 17:00).\n   - **Cheryl and Virginia busy**: Doesn't work.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Only Possible Slot\nFrom the above, the only 30-minute slot where everyone is free is **13:30 - 14:00**.\n\nLet's double-check each person's availability at this time:\n\n- **Daniel**: Free.\n- **Kathleen**: Free (only busy 14:30-15:30).\n- **Carolyn**: Free (last busy 13:00-13:30).\n- **Roger**: Free and after 12:30.\n- **Cheryl**: Free (last busy 12:30-13:30, next at 14:00).\n- **Virginia**: Free (last busy 13:00-13:30, next at 14:30).\n- **Angela**: Free (last busy 13:00-13:30, next at 14:00).\n\nAll are free at 13:30 - 14:00, and it's after 12:30, satisfying Roger's preference.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe meeting can be scheduled from 13:30 to 14:00 on Monday.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"13:30:14:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
