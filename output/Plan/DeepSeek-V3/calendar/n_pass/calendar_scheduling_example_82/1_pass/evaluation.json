We need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 where Michael, Eric, and Arthur are all available. \n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's busy times and then find the gaps where all three are free.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Michael:**\n   - 9:30 - 10:30\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n2. **Eric:**\n   - Entire day is open (no meetings)\n\n3. **Arthur:**\n   - 9:00 - 12:00\n   - 13:00 - 15:00\n   - 15:30 - 16:00\n   - 16:30 - 17:00\n\n### Step 1: Combine All Busy Times\nTo find when all are free, we can look for times when none of the above blocks overlap for all three.\n\nLet's list the busy times in order:\n\n- 9:00 - 10:30 (Arthur 9-12, Michael 9:30-10:30)\n- 12:00 - 13:00 (Arthur is free, Michael is free, Eric is free)\nWait, no: Arthur is busy 9-12 and 13-15, so between 12-13 Arthur is free.\nMichael is only busy 9:30-10:30, 15-15:30, 16-16:30.\nEric is always free.\n\nSo potential free times are when Arthur is free and Michael is free.\n\nArthur's free times:\n- Before 9:00 (but work starts at 9:00)\n- 12:00 - 13:00\n- 15:00 - 15:30 (but Arthur is busy 13-15 and then 15:30-16:00)\nWait, let's list Arthur's free times within 9-17:\n\nArthur's busy:\n9-12, 13-15, 15:30-16, 16:30-17\nSo free:\n12-13\n15-15:30 (but 15-15:30 Michael is busy)\n16-16:30 (but Michael is busy 16-16:30)\nAfter 16:30 Arthur is busy, before 9 is not work hours.\n\nSo only free slot for Arthur is 12-13.\n\nNow check Michael during 12-13:\nMichael's busy times: 9:30-10:30, 15-15:30, 16-16:30.\n12-13 is free for Michael.\nEric is always free.\n\nSo 12:00 - 13:00 is free for all.\n\nWe need a 30-minute meeting, so possible slots within 12-13:\n12:00 - 12:30\n12:30 - 13:00\n\nBoth are fine since no other constraints are given.\n\n### Step 2: Verify No Overlaps\nLet's pick 12:00 - 12:30:\n- Michael: free (no meetings then)\n- Eric: free\n- Arthur: free (12-13 is free for Arthur)\n\nNo overlaps with any busy times.\n\n### Step 3: Check Other Possible Slots\nAre there other times when all are free?\n\nLet's look at the entire day:\n\n9:00 - 9:30:\n- Arthur: busy (9-12)\n- Michael: free until 9:30\nBut Arthur is busy, so no.\n\n9:30 - 10:30:\n- Michael: busy\n- Arthur: busy\nNo.\n\n10:30 - 12:00:\n- Michael: free\n- Arthur: busy\nNo.\n\n12:00 - 13:00:\n- Arthur: free\n- Michael: free\n- Eric: free\nThis is the only window.\n\nAfter 13:00:\n13:00 - 15:00:\n- Arthur: busy\nNo.\n\n15:00 - 15:30:\n- Michael: busy\n- Arthur: busy until 15:00, then free 15-15:30 but Michael is busy\nNo.\n\n15:30 - 16:00:\n- Arthur: busy\nNo.\n\n16:00 - 16:30:\n- Michael: busy\n- Arthur: free, but Michael is busy\nNo.\n\n16:30 - 17:00:\n- Arthur: busy\nNo.\n\nSo the only possible time is between 12:00 and 13:00.\n\n### Final Answer:\nWe can schedule the meeting from 12:00 to 12:30 on Monday.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"12:00:12:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
