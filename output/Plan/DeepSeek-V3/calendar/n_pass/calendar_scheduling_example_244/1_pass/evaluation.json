We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where all five participants\u2014Walter, Cynthia, Ann, Catherine, and Kyle\u2014are available. \n\nFirst, let's list out each person's busy times and then find the gaps where none of them are busy.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Walter**: No meetings all day. So, completely free from 9:00 to 17:00.\n2. **Cynthia**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:00 - 10:30\n   - 13:30 - 14:30\n   - 15:00 - 16:00\n3. **Ann**:\n   - 10:00 - 11:00\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:00 - 15:00\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n4. **Catherine**:\n   - 9:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:30 - 13:30\n   - 14:30 - 17:00\n5. **Kyle**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:00 - 14:30\n   - 15:00 - 16:00\n\n### Approach:\nTo find a time when all are free, we'll look for a 30-minute window that doesn't overlap with any of the busy times listed above. \n\nLet's go through the day in order and check possible slots:\n\n1. **9:00 - 9:30**:\n   - Walter: Free\n   - Cynthia: Busy (9:00 - 9:30)\n   - Ann: Free\n   - Catherine: Busy (9:00 - 11:30)\n   - Kyle: Busy (9:00 - 9:30)\n   - **Not available** (Cynthia, Catherine, Kyle busy)\n\n2. **9:30 - 10:00**:\n   - Walter: Free\n   - Cynthia: Free (last busy until 9:30)\n   - Ann: Free\n   - Catherine: Busy (until 11:30)\n   - Kyle: Free (last busy until 9:30)\n   - **Not available** (Catherine busy)\n\n3. **10:00 - 10:30**:\n   - Walter: Free\n   - Cynthia: Busy (10:00 - 10:30)\n   - Ann: Busy (10:00 - 11:00)\n   - Catherine: Busy\n   - Kyle: Busy (10:00 - 11:30)\n   - **Not available**\n\n4. **10:30 - 11:00**:\n   - Walter: Free\n   - Cynthia: Free (last busy until 10:30)\n   - Ann: Busy (until 11:00)\n   - Catherine: Busy\n   - Kyle: Busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n5. **11:00 - 11:30**:\n   - Walter: Free\n   - Cynthia: Free\n   - Ann: Free (busy until 11:00)\n   - Catherine: Busy\n   - Kyle: Busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n6. **11:30 - 12:00**:\n   - Walter: Free\n   - Cynthia: Free\n   - Ann: Free\n   - Catherine: Free (last busy until 11:30)\n   - Kyle: Free (last busy until 11:30)\n   - **Potential slot**: Let's check if anyone is busy here.\n     - No overlaps in the given busy times.\n   - **Available**\n\nBut let's check the next possible slots to ensure this is the only one or if there are others.\n\n7. **12:00 - 12:30**:\n   - Walter: Free\n   - Cynthia: Free\n   - Ann: Free\n   - Catherine: Free\n   - Kyle: Busy (12:00 - 12:30)\n   - **Not available**\n\n8. **12:30 - 13:00**:\n   - Walter: Free\n   - Cynthia: Free\n   - Ann: Free\n   - Catherine: Busy (12:30 - 13:30)\n   - Kyle: Free (last busy until 12:30)\n   - **Not available**\n\n9. **13:00 - 13:30**:\n   - Walter: Free\n   - Cynthia: Free (next busy at 13:30)\n   - Ann: Busy (13:00 - 13:30)\n   - Catherine: Busy\n   - Kyle: Busy (13:00 - 14:30)\n   - **Not available**\n\n10. **13:30 - 14:00**:\n    - Walter: Free\n    - Cynthia: Busy (13:30 - 14:30)\n    - Ann: Free (busy until 13:30)\n    - Catherine: Busy (until 13:30, then next at 14:30)\n    - Kyle: Busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n11. **14:00 - 14:30**:\n    - Walter: Free\n    - Cynthia: Busy\n    - Ann: Busy (14:00 - 15:00)\n    - Catherine: Free (next busy at 14:30)\n    - Kyle: Busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n12. **14:30 - 15:00**:\n    - Walter: Free\n    - Cynthia: Free (last busy until 14:30)\n    - Ann: Busy (until 15:00)\n    - Catherine: Busy (14:30 - 17:00)\n    - Kyle: Free (last busy until 14:30)\n    - **Not available**\n\n13. **15:00 - 15:30**:\n    - Walter: Free\n    - Cynthia: Busy (15:00 - 16:00)\n    - Ann: Free (busy until 15:00)\n    - Catherine: Busy\n    - Kyle: Busy (15:00 - 16:00)\n    - **Not available**\n\n14. **15:30 - 16:00**:\n    - Walter: Free\n    - Cynthia: Busy\n    - Ann: Free\n    - Catherine: Busy\n    - Kyle: Busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n15. **16:00 - 16:30**:\n    - Walter: Free\n    - Cynthia: Free (last busy until 16:00)\n    - Ann: Busy (16:00 - 16:30)\n    - Catherine: Busy\n    - Kyle: Free (last busy until 16:00)\n    - **Not available**\n\n16. **16:30 - 17:00**:\n    - Walter: Free\n    - Cynthia: Free\n    - Ann: Free (last busy until 16:30)\n    - Catherine: Busy\n    - Kyle: Free\n    - **Not available** (Catherine busy)\n\n### Reviewing Potential Slots:\nFrom the above, the only 30-minute window where all are free is **11:30 - 12:00**.\n\nLet's double-check this slot:\n\n- **11:30 - 12:00**:\n  - Walter: Free\n  - Cynthia: \n    - Last busy: 10:00 - 10:30\n    - Next busy: 13:30 - 14:30\n    - So free at 11:30 - 12:00\n  - Ann:\n    - Last busy: 10:00 - 11:00\n    - Next busy: 13:00 - 13:30\n    - Free at 11:30 - 12:00\n  - Catherine:\n    - Last busy: 9:00 - 11:30\n    - Next busy: 12:30 - 13:30\n    - 11:30 is the end of her first meeting, so she's free from 11:30 onwards until 12:30.\n  - Kyle:\n    - Last busy: 10:00 - 11:30\n    - Next busy: 12:00 - 12:30\n    - So free from 11:30 - 12:00.\n\nEveryone is indeed free during 11:30 - 12:00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"11:30:12:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
