We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday that works for both Jean and Doris, while also considering Doris's preference not to meet on Monday after 14:00.\n\n### Understanding the Schedules:\n\n**Jean's Busy Times:**\n- Tuesday:\n  - 11:30 to 12:00\n  - 16:00 to 16:30\n\n**Doris's Busy Times:**\n- Monday:\n  - 9:00 to 11:30\n  - 12:00 to 12:30\n  - 13:30 to 16:00\n  - 16:30 to 17:00\n- Tuesday:\n  - 9:00 to 17:00 (entire day)\n\n**Doris's Preference:**\n- Prefers not to meet on Monday after 14:00.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Days:\n\n1. **Tuesday:**\n   - Doris is busy the entire day (9:00 to 17:00). So, no available slots on Tuesday.\n   \n2. **Monday:**\n   - Let's look at Doris's Monday schedule to find free times:\n     - Busy: 9:00-11:30, 12:00-12:30, 13:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n     - Free times between these:\n       - 11:30 to 12:00\n       - 12:30 to 13:30\n       - 16:00 to 16:30\n   - Now, Jean has no scheduled meetings on Monday (since Jean's busy times are only on Tuesday), so Jean is free all day Monday.\n   - Doris's preference is not to meet after 14:00 on Monday. So, we should prioritize times before 14:00.\n     - Possible slots before 14:00:\n       - 11:30 to 12:00\n       - 12:30 to 13:30\n     - After 14:00 (if needed):\n       - 16:00 to 16:30 (but Doris prefers not after 14:00, so let's avoid this if possible)\n\n**Available Slots on Monday Before 14:00:**\n- 11:30 to 12:00:\n  - Doris is free (from her schedule).\n  - Jean is free (no conflicts on Monday).\n  - Duration: 30 minutes (perfect).\n  \n- 12:30 to 13:30:\n  - Doris is free.\n  - Jean is free.\n  - Duration: 1 hour (but we only need 30 minutes, so we can choose any 30-minute window here, like 12:30-13:00 or 13:00-13:30).\n\n**Choosing the Best Slot:**\n- Doris prefers not after 14:00, so both 11:30-12:00 and 12:30-13:00/13:00-13:30 are fine.\n- 11:30-12:00 is exactly 30 minutes and fits perfectly without needing to split a larger window.\n  \n**Checking for Conflicts:**\n- Jean:\n  - Monday: completely free.\n  - Tuesday: conflicts are irrelevant for Monday.\n- Doris:\n  - Monday at 11:30-12:00: free.\n  \nNo conflicts for either at 11:30-12:00 on Monday.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe best time is **Monday, 11:30 to 12:00**.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"11:30:12:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
