We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday that works for both Ryan and Adam, considering their existing schedules and additional constraints.\n\n### Given Constraints:\n1. **Participants**: Ryan and Adam.\n2. **Meeting Duration**: 30 minutes.\n3. **Work Hours**: 9:00 to 17:00.\n4. **Possible Days**: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n5. **Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday**.\n6. **Adam prefers to avoid Monday meetings before 14:30**.\n\n### Existing Schedules:\n\n**Ryan's Busy Times:**\n- **Monday**:\n  - 9:30 - 10:00\n  - 11:00 - 12:00\n  - 13:00 - 13:30\n  - 15:30 - 16:00\n- **Tuesday**:\n  - 11:30 - 12:30\n  - 15:30 - 16:00\n- **Wednesday**:\n  - 12:00 - 13:00\n  - 15:30 - 16:00\n  - 16:30 - 17:00\n  - (But Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday, so we can ignore Wednesday.)\n\n**Adam's Busy Times:**\n- **Monday**:\n  - 9:00 - 10:30\n  - 11:00 - 13:30\n  - 14:00 - 16:00\n  - 16:30 - 17:00\n- **Tuesday**:\n  - 9:00 - 10:00\n  - 10:30 - 15:30\n  - 16:00 - 17:00\n- **Wednesday**:\n  - 9:00 - 9:30\n  - 10:00 - 11:00\n  - 11:30 - 14:30\n  - 15:00 - 15:30\n  - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n### Additional Constraints:\n- Ryan cannot meet on Wednesday \u2192 Only consider Monday and Tuesday.\n- Adam prefers no Monday meetings before 14:30 \u2192 On Monday, only consider times from 14:30 onwards.\n\n### Possible Days to Consider:\n1. **Monday** (after 14:30)\n2. **Tuesday**\n\nLet's examine each day.\n\n#### 1. Monday (after 14:30):\n- **Ryan's Monday Availability**:\n  - Busy: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:30-16:00\n  - Free blocks:\n    - 9:00-9:30\n    - 10:00-11:00\n    - 12:00-13:00\n    - 13:30-15:30\n    - 16:00-17:00\n  - After 14:30:\n    - 14:30-15:30 (since 15:30-16:00 is busy)\n    - 16:00-17:00\n\n- **Adam's Monday Availability**:\n  - Busy: 9:00-10:30, 11:00-13:30, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n  - Free blocks:\n    - 10:30-11:00\n    - 13:30-14:00\n    - After 14:30: 16:00-16:30 (since 14:00-16:00 is busy, and 16:30-17:00 is busy)\n  \n- **Overlapping Free Times on Monday after 14:30**:\n  - Ryan: 14:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n  - Adam: 16:00-16:30\n  - Overlap: 16:00-16:30 (30 minutes)\n\nBut let's check if 16:00-16:30 works:\n- Ryan is free at 16:00-17:00 (no conflict at 16:00-16:30).\n- Adam is free at 16:00-16:30.\n  \nThis seems to work. But let's check Tuesday to see if there's another option.\n\n#### 2. Tuesday:\n- **Ryan's Tuesday Availability**:\n  - Busy: 11:30-12:30, 15:30-16:00\n  - Free blocks:\n    - 9:00-11:30\n    - 12:30-15:30\n    - 16:00-17:00\n\n- **Adam's Tuesday Availability**:\n  - Busy: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n  - Free blocks:\n    - 10:00-10:30\n    - 15:30-16:00\n\n- **Overlapping Free Times on Tuesday**:\n  - Ryan: 9:00-11:30, 12:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n  - Adam: 10:00-10:30, 15:30-16:00\n  - Possible overlaps:\n    - 10:00-10:30:\n      - Ryan is free (9:00-11:30).\n      - Adam is free (10:00-10:30).\n    - 15:30-16:00:\n      - Ryan is busy (15:30-16:00).\n      - Adam is free (15:30-16:00).\n      - Conflict here.\n    - So only 10:00-10:30 is possible.\n\nBut let's check if Adam has any constraints on Tuesday. The problem mentions Adam would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:30, but doesn't mention Tuesday preferences. So 10:00-10:30 on Tuesday seems fine.\n\nHowever, the problem states that Adam would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:30, but doesn't restrict Tuesday. So both Monday 16:00-16:30 and Tuesday 10:00-10:30 seem possible.\n\nBut the problem mentions \"Tuesday.\" after the Monday constraint, which might imply that the solution is on Tuesday. Maybe the Monday option is less preferred because Adam prefers to avoid Monday before 14:30, and Monday's available slot is at 16:00-16:30, which is after 14:30, but Tuesday has an earlier slot.\n\nGiven that, both are valid, but perhaps Tuesday 10:00-10:30 is more optimal since it's earlier in the day.\n\nBut let's see the options:\n- Monday: 16:00-16:30\n- Tuesday: 10:00-10:30\n\nBoth fit all constraints. Since the problem mentions \"Tuesday.\" after the Monday constraints, it might hint that Tuesday is the preferred day. Also, Monday's slot is very late in the day (16:00), whereas Tuesday's is at 10:00, which might be more convenient.\n\n### Final Decision:\n**Tuesday, 10:00-10:30** is a valid and likely preferred slot.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Ryan on Tuesday**:\n  - Busy: 11:30-12:30, 15:30-16:00\n  - 10:00-10:30 is free.\n- **Adam on Tuesday**:\n  - Busy: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-15:30, 16:00-17:00\n  - 10:00-10:30 is free.\n\nNo conflicts, meets all constraints.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"10:00:10:30\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```",
