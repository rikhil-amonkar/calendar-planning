We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where all four participants\u2014Diane, Jack, Eugene, and Patricia\u2014are available. \n\nFirst, let's list out each person's blocked times in a more visual way to see where the overlaps are.\n\n### Participants' Blocked Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Diane:**\n   - 9:30 - 10:00\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n\n2. **Jack:**\n   - 13:30 - 14:00\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n\n3. **Eugene:**\n   - 9:00 - 10:00\n   - 10:30 - 11:30\n   - 12:00 - 14:30\n   - 15:00 - 16:30\n\n4. **Patricia:**\n   - 9:30 - 10:30\n   - 11:00 - 12:00\n   - 12:30 - 14:00\n   - 15:00 - 16:30\n\n### Approach:\n\nTo find a common 30-minute slot, we'll look for times when none of the participants have any blocked times. \n\nLet's go through the day hour by hour, checking each 30-minute interval:\n\n1. **9:00 - 9:30:**\n   - Diane: free\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: blocked (9:00 - 10:00)\n   - Patricia: free until 9:30\n   - **Eugene is blocked, so not available.**\n\n2. **9:30 - 10:00:**\n   - Diane: blocked\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: blocked\n   - Patricia: blocked\n   - **Diane, Eugene, Patricia blocked.**\n\n3. **10:00 - 10:30:**\n   - Diane: free\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: blocked until 10:00, then free until 10:30\n   - Patricia: blocked until 10:30\n   - **Patricia is blocked.**\n\n4. **10:30 - 11:00:**\n   - Diane: free\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: blocked (10:30 - 11:30)\n   - Patricia: free (from 10:30 - 11:00)\n   - **Eugene is blocked.**\n\n5. **11:00 - 11:30:**\n   - Diane: free\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: blocked\n   - Patricia: blocked\n   - **Eugene and Patricia blocked.**\n\n6. **11:30 - 12:00:**\n   - Diane: free\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: free (from 11:30 - 12:00)\n   - Patricia: blocked\n   - **Patricia blocked.**\n\n7. **12:00 - 12:30:**\n   - Diane: free\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: blocked (12:00 - 14:30)\n   - Patricia: free until 12:30\n   - **Eugene blocked.**\n\n8. **12:30 - 13:00:**\n   - Diane: free\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: blocked\n   - Patricia: blocked\n   - **Eugene and Patricia blocked.**\n\n9. **13:00 - 13:30:**\n   - Diane: free\n   - Jack: free\n   - Eugene: blocked\n   - Patricia: blocked\n   - **Eugene and Patricia blocked.**\n\n10. **13:30 - 14:00:**\n    - Diane: free\n    - Jack: blocked\n    - Eugene: blocked\n    - Patricia: blocked\n    - **Jack, Eugene, Patricia blocked.**\n\n11. **14:00 - 14:30:**\n    - Diane: free\n    - Jack: free (from 14:00 - 14:30)\n    - Eugene: blocked until 14:30\n    - Patricia: blocked until 14:00, then free until 15:00\n    - **Eugene blocked until 14:30, but we're looking at 14:00 - 14:30, so Eugene is still blocked.**\n\n12. **14:30 - 15:00:**\n    - Diane: blocked\n    - Jack: blocked\n    - Eugene: free (from 14:30 - 15:00)\n    - Patricia: free\n    - **Diane and Jack blocked.**\n\n13. **15:00 - 15:30:**\n    - Diane: free\n    - Jack: free\n    - Eugene: blocked (15:00 - 16:30)\n    - Patricia: blocked\n    - **Eugene and Patricia blocked.**\n\n14. **15:30 - 16:00:**\n    - Diane: free\n    - Jack: free\n    - Eugene: blocked\n    - Patricia: blocked\n    - **Eugene and Patricia blocked.**\n\n15. **16:00 - 16:30:**\n    - Diane: free\n    - Jack: free\n    - Eugene: blocked\n    - Patricia: blocked\n    - **Eugene and Patricia blocked.**\n\n16. **16:30 - 17:00:**\n    - Diane: free\n    - Jack: free\n    - Eugene: free (from 16:30)\n    - Patricia: free (from 16:30)\n    - **All free!**\n\n### Checking 16:30 - 17:00:\n\n- Diane: no blocks\n- Jack: no blocks\n- Eugene: no blocks (last block ends at 16:30)\n- Patricia: no blocks (last block ends at 16:30)\n\nThis is a 30-minute window where all four participants are available.\n\n### Verifying Other Possible Slots:\n\nIs there any other time when all are free? From the above, the only time all are free is 16:30 - 17:00. All other times have at least one person blocked.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"16:30:17:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
