We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where all of them are free. \n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's busy times and then find the gaps where everyone is available.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Steven**: Free all day.\n2. **Roy**: Free all day.\n3. **Cynthia**:\n   - 9:30 - 10:30\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 15:00 - 16:00\n4. **Lauren**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:30 - 11:00\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:00 - 14:30\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n   - 16:00 - 17:00\n5. **Robert**:\n   - 10:30 - 11:00\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 12:30 - 13:30\n   - 14:00 - 16:00\n\n### Approach to Find Common Free Time:\n\nTo find when everyone is free, we'll look for 30-minute slots where none of the busy times overlap. Since Steven and Roy are always free, we only need to consider Cynthia, Lauren, and Robert's schedules.\n\nLet's list the busy times collectively and then find the gaps.\n\n**Combined Busy Times (from all except Steven and Roy):**\n\n- 9:00 - 9:30 (Lauren)\n- 9:30 - 10:30 (Cynthia)\n- 10:30 - 11:00 (Lauren, Robert)\n- 11:00 - 11:30 (No one is busy here? Wait, let's check:\n  - Cynthia is busy 11:30-12:00\n  - Lauren is busy 11:30-12:00\n  - Robert is busy 11:30-12:00\n  So 11:00-11:30 is free for all.)\n- 11:30 - 12:00 (Cynthia, Lauren, Robert)\n- 12:00 - 12:30 (Only Robert is busy from 12:30, so 12:00-12:30 is free)\n- 12:30 - 13:30 (Robert)\n- 13:00 - 13:30 (Cynthia, Lauren also busy here, overlaps with Robert)\n- 14:00 - 14:30 (Lauren, Robert)\n- 14:30 - 15:00 (Robert is busy until 16:00, but let's see:\n  - Robert is busy 14:00-16:00\n  - Lauren is busy 15:00-15:30\n  - Cynthia is busy 15:00-16:00\n  So 14:30-15:00: Robert is busy, so no.\n- 15:00 - 16:00 (Cynthia, Lauren has 15:00-15:30, Robert is busy until 16:00)\n- 16:00 - 17:00 (Lauren)\n\nNow, let's list the potential free slots where no one is busy:\n\n1. **9:00 - 9:30**: Lauren is busy. \u274c\n2. **9:30 - 10:30**: Cynthia is busy. \u274c\n3. **10:30 - 11:00**: Lauren and Robert are busy. \u274c\n4. **11:00 - 11:30**: \n   - Cynthia: free\n   - Lauren: free\n   - Robert: free\n   - Steven and Roy: free\n   \u2705 All free.\n5. **11:30 - 12:00**: Cynthia, Lauren, Robert busy. \u274c\n6. **12:00 - 12:30**:\n   - Cynthia: free\n   - Lauren: free\n   - Robert: free until 12:30\n   \u2705 All free.\n7. **12:30 - 13:30**: Robert is busy, Cynthia and Lauren also busy at 13:00-13:30. \u274c\n8. **13:30 - 14:00**:\n   - Cynthia: free\n   - Lauren: free (last meeting until 13:30, next at 14:00)\n   - Robert: busy until 16:00\n   \u274c Robert is busy.\n9. **14:00 - 14:30**: Lauren and Robert busy. \u274c\n10. **14:30 - 15:00**: Robert is busy. \u274c\n11. **15:00 - 16:00**: Cynthia, Lauren (until 15:30), Robert busy. \u274c\n12. **16:00 - 17:00**: Lauren busy. \u274c\n\n### Possible Free Slots:\n\nFrom the above, the potential 30-minute slots where everyone is free are:\n\n1. 11:00 - 11:30\n2. 12:00 - 12:30\n\nThe group prefers the earliest availability, so we'll choose the first one.\n\n### Verifying 11:00 - 11:30:\n\n- Steven: free\n- Roy: free\n- Cynthia: free (busy 11:30-12:00)\n- Lauren: free (last meeting until 11:00, next at 11:30)\n- Robert: free (last busy until 11:00, next at 11:30)\n\nYes, all are free from 11:00 to 11:30.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"11:00:11:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
