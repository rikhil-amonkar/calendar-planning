We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where all of them are free. \n\nFirst, let's summarize everyone's busy times on Monday:\n\n1. **Steven**: Free all day.\n2. **Roy**: Free all day.\n3. **Cynthia**:\n   - 9:30 - 10:30\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 15:00 - 16:00\n4. **Lauren**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:30 - 11:00\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:00 - 14:30\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n   - 16:00 - 17:00\n5. **Robert**:\n   - 10:30 - 11:00\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 12:30 - 13:30\n   - 14:00 - 16:00\n\nNow, let's list out the busy times for all participants combined. A time is busy if at least one person is busy during that time.\n\nWe'll go through each half-hour slot from 9:00 to 17:00 and mark it as busy if any participant is busy during that time.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n- **9:00 - 9:30**:\n  - Lauren is busy.\n  - Others are free.\n  - **Busy**.\n\n- **9:30 - 10:00**:\n  - Cynthia is busy (9:30 - 10:30).\n  - Lauren is free.\n  - Robert is free.\n  - **Busy**.\n\n- **10:00 - 10:30**:\n  - Cynthia is still busy (until 10:30).\n  - Lauren is free.\n  - Robert is free.\n  - **Busy**.\n\n- **10:30 - 11:00**:\n  - Cynthia is free (her next busy is at 11:30).\n  - Lauren is busy (10:30 - 11:00).\n  - Robert is busy (10:30 - 11:00).\n  - **Busy**.\n\n- **11:00 - 11:30**:\n  - Cynthia is free.\n  - Lauren is free (her next busy is at 11:30).\n  - Robert is free (his next busy is at 11:30).\n  - **Free**.\n\n- **11:30 - 12:00**:\n  - Cynthia is busy.\n  - Lauren is busy.\n  - Robert is busy.\n  - **Busy**.\n\n- **12:00 - 12:30**:\n  - Cynthia is free.\n  - Lauren is free.\n  - Robert is free (his next busy is at 12:30).\n  - **Free**.\n\n- **12:30 - 13:00**:\n  - Cynthia is free (her next busy is at 13:00).\n  - Lauren is free (her next busy is at 13:00).\n  - Robert is busy (12:30 - 13:30).\n  - **Busy**.\n\n- **13:00 - 13:30**:\n  - Cynthia is busy.\n  - Lauren is busy.\n  - Robert is busy.\n  - **Busy**.\n\n- **13:30 - 14:00**:\n  - Cynthia is free.\n  - Lauren is free (her next busy is at 14:00).\n  - Robert is free (his busy ends at 13:30).\n  - **Free**.\n\n- **14:00 - 14:30**:\n  - Cynthia is free.\n  - Lauren is busy.\n  - Robert is busy.\n  - **Busy**.\n\n- **14:30 - 15:00**:\n  - Cynthia is free.\n  - Lauren is free (her next busy is at 15:00).\n  - Robert is busy (until 16:00).\n  - **Busy** (because Robert is busy).\n\n- **15:00 - 15:30**:\n  - Cynthia is busy (15:00 - 16:00).\n  - Lauren is busy.\n  - Robert is busy.\n  - **Busy**.\n\n- **15:30 - 16:00**:\n  - Cynthia is busy.\n  - Lauren is free (her next busy is at 16:00).\n  - Robert is busy.\n  - **Busy**.\n\n- **16:00 - 16:30**:\n  - Cynthia is free (her busy ends at 16:00).\n  - Lauren is busy.\n  - Robert is free (his busy ends at 16:00).\n  - **Busy** (because Lauren is busy).\n\n- **16:30 - 17:00**:\n  - Cynthia is free.\n  - Lauren is busy.\n  - Robert is free.\n  - **Busy** (because Lauren is busy).\n\nNow, let's list all the free slots where everyone is available:\n\n1. **11:00 - 11:30**\n2. **12:00 - 12:30**\n3. **13:30 - 14:00**\n\nThe group wants to meet at their earliest availability, so we'll pick the first available slot.\n\n**First available slot: 11:00 - 11:30**\n\nLet's double-check this slot:\n\n- Steven: Free\n- Roy: Free\n- Cynthia: Free (not busy until 11:30)\n- Lauren: Free (last busy until 11:00, next at 11:30)\n- Robert: Free (last busy until 11:00, next at 11:30)\n\nPerfect, everyone is free from 11:00 to 11:30.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"11:00:11:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
