You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Judy, Olivia, Eric, Jacqueline, Laura, Tyler and Lisa for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nJudy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nOlivia is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30; \nEric is free the entire day.\nJacqueline has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nLaura is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nTyler has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; \nLisa has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}\n\nFor example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"

We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where all seven participants\u2014Judy, Olivia, Eric, Jacqueline, Laura, Tyler, and Lisa\u2014are free. \n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's busy times in a more manageable way. I'll create a timeline from 9:00 to 17:00 in 30-minute increments and mark when each person is busy.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times:\n\n1. **Judy**:\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n2. **Olivia**:\n   - 10:00 - 10:30\n   - 12:00 - 13:00\n   - 14:00 - 14:30\n\n3. **Eric**: Free all day.\n\n4. **Jacqueline**:\n   - 10:00 - 10:30\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n\n5. **Laura**:\n   - 9:00 - 10:00\n   - 10:30 - 12:00\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n   - 15:30 - 17:00\n\n6. **Tyler**:\n   - 9:00 - 10:00\n   - 11:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:30 - 13:00\n   - 14:00 - 14:30\n   - 15:30 - 17:00\n\n7. **Lisa**:\n   - 9:30 - 10:30\n   - 11:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:00 - 14:30\n   - 16:00 - 17:00\n\n### Creating a Combined Availability:\n\nNow, let's go through each 30-minute slot and see who's available:\n\n- **9:00 - 9:30**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy (9:00 - 10:00)\n  - Tyler: Busy (9:00 - 10:00)\n  - Lisa: Free until 9:30\n  - **Conflict**: Laura and Tyler are busy.\n\n- **9:30 - 10:00**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy (until 10:00)\n  - Tyler: Busy (until 10:00)\n  - Lisa: Busy (9:30 - 10:30)\n  - **Conflict**: Laura, Tyler, Lisa busy.\n\n- **10:00 - 10:30**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Busy\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Busy\n  - Laura: Busy (10:30 - 12:00, but at 10:00 - 10:30, she's free after 10:00 - 10:00 is unclear; actually, Laura is busy 9:00 - 10:00 and then 10:30 - 12:00, so 10:00 - 10:30 she's free except first 10 minutes? Wait, 9:00 - 10:00 is busy, so 10:00 - 10:30 is free except if the meeting starts at 10:00, but since Laura is busy until 10:00, she's free at 10:00 - 10:30.\n  - Tyler: Free (busy until 10:00)\n  - Lisa: Busy (9:30 - 10:30)\n  - **Conflict**: Olivia, Jacqueline, Lisa busy.\n\n- **10:30 - 11:00**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free (not in her busy times)\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free (not in her busy times)\n  - Laura: Busy (10:30 - 12:00)\n  - Tyler: Free\n  - Lisa: Free (her next busy is 11:00)\n  - **Conflict**: Laura busy.\n\n- **11:00 - 11:30**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy (10:30 - 12:00)\n  - Tyler: Busy\n  - Lisa: Busy\n  - **Conflict**: Laura, Tyler, Lisa busy.\n\n- **11:30 - 12:00**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy (until 12:00)\n  - Tyler: Free\n  - Lisa: Free (her next busy is 12:00)\n  - **Conflict**: Laura busy.\n\n- **12:00 - 12:30**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Busy (12:00 - 13:00)\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Free (12:00 - 13:00 is free for Laura?
