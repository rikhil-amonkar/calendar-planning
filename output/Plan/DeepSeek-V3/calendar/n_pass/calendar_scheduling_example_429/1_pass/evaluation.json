We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where all seven participants\u2014Judy, Olivia, Eric, Jacqueline, Laura, Tyler, and Lisa\u2014are free. \n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's busy times in a more manageable way. I'll create a timeline from 9:00 to 17:00 in 30-minute increments and mark when each person is busy.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times:\n\n1. **Judy**:\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n2. **Olivia**:\n   - 10:00 - 10:30\n   - 12:00 - 13:00\n   - 14:00 - 14:30\n\n3. **Eric**: Free all day.\n\n4. **Jacqueline**:\n   - 10:00 - 10:30\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n\n5. **Laura**:\n   - 9:00 - 10:00\n   - 10:30 - 12:00\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n   - 15:30 - 17:00\n\n6. **Tyler**:\n   - 9:00 - 10:00\n   - 11:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:30 - 13:00\n   - 14:00 - 14:30\n   - 15:30 - 17:00\n\n7. **Lisa**:\n   - 9:30 - 10:30\n   - 11:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:00 - 14:30\n   - 16:00 - 17:00\n\n### Creating a Combined Availability:\n\nNow, let's go through each 30-minute slot and see who's available:\n\n- **9:00 - 9:30**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy (9:00 - 10:00)\n  - Tyler: Busy (9:00 - 10:00)\n  - Lisa: Free until 9:30\n  - **Conflict**: Laura and Tyler are busy.\n\n- **9:30 - 10:00**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy (until 10:00)\n  - Tyler: Busy (until 10:00)\n  - Lisa: Busy (9:30 - 10:30)\n  - **Conflict**: Laura, Tyler, Lisa busy.\n\n- **10:00 - 10:30**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Busy\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Busy\n  - Laura: Busy (10:30 - 12:00, but at 10:00 - 10:30, she's free after 10:00 - 10:00 is unclear; actually, Laura is busy 9:00 - 10:00 and then 10:30 - 12:00, so 10:00 - 10:30 she's free except first 10 minutes? Wait, 9:00 - 10:00 is busy, so 10:00 - 10:30 is free except if the meeting starts at 10:00, but since Laura is busy until 10:00, she's free at 10:00 - 10:30.\n  - Tyler: Free (busy until 10:00)\n  - Lisa: Busy (9:30 - 10:30)\n  - **Conflict**: Olivia, Jacqueline, Lisa busy.\n\n- **10:30 - 11:00**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free (not in her busy times)\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free (not in her busy times)\n  - Laura: Busy (10:30 - 12:00)\n  - Tyler: Free\n  - Lisa: Free (her next busy is 11:00)\n  - **Conflict**: Laura busy.\n\n- **11:00 - 11:30**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy (10:30 - 12:00)\n  - Tyler: Busy\n  - Lisa: Busy\n  - **Conflict**: Laura, Tyler, Lisa busy.\n\n- **11:30 - 12:00**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy (until 12:00)\n  - Tyler: Free\n  - Lisa: Free (her next busy is 12:00)\n  - **Conflict**: Laura busy.\n\n- **12:00 - 12:30**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Busy (12:00 - 13:00)\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Free (12:00 - 13:00 is free for Laura? Wait, Laura is busy 10:30 - 12:00, then 13:00 - 13:30, so 12:00 - 13:00 is free except at 13:00)\n  - Tyler: Free (next busy at 12:30)\n  - Lisa: Busy\n  - **Conflict**: Olivia, Lisa busy.\n\n- **12:30 - 13:00**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Busy\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Free (until 13:00)\n  - Tyler: Busy\n  - Lisa: Free (her next busy is 13:00)\n  - **Conflict**: Olivia, Tyler busy.\n\n- **13:00 - 13:30**:\n  - Judy: Busy\n  - Olivia: Busy\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy\n  - Tyler: Free (his next busy is 14:00)\n  - Lisa: Busy\n  - **Conflict**: Judy, Olivia, Laura, Lisa busy.\n\n- **13:30 - 14:00**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free (her next busy is 14:00)\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Free (her next busy is 14:30)\n  - Tyler: Free\n  - Lisa: Free (her next busy is 14:00)\n  - **All free!**\n\nWait, let's check:\n- Judy: Not busy (busy at 13:00-13:30 and 16:00-16:30)\n- Olivia: Not busy (busy until 13:00, then next at 14:00)\n- Eric: Always free\n- Jacqueline: Not busy (last at 15:00)\n- Laura: Not busy (last at 13:00-13:30, next at 14:30)\n- Tyler: Not busy (last at 12:30-13:00, next at 14:00)\n- Lisa: Not busy (last at 13:00-13:30, next at 14:00)\n\nWait a minute, Lisa is busy at 14:00, so 13:30-14:00 is free for her.\nSimilarly, Olivia is busy until 13:00, then free until 14:00.\nTyler is free until 14:00.\nLaura is free until 14:30.\nJacqueline is free until 15:00.\nJudy is free except at 13:00-13:30 and 16:00-16:30.\n\nSo, **13:30 - 14:00** seems to be a slot where everyone is free.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Judy: Not busy at 13:30-14:00 (busy at 13:00-13:30)\n- Olivia: Not busy at 13:30-14:00 (busy until 13:00, then at 14:00)\n- Eric: Free\n- Jacqueline: Not busy\n- Laura: Not busy (next at 14:30)\n- Tyler: Not busy (next at 14:00)\n- Lisa: Not busy (next at 14:00)\n\nSo, all are free at 13:30 - 14:00.\n\nIs there any other slot?\n\nLet me check around to ensure this is the only one.\n\n- **14:00 - 14:30**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Busy\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Free (until 14:30)\n  - Tyler: Busy\n  - Lisa: Busy\n  - **Conflict**: Olivia, Tyler, Lisa busy.\n\n- **14:30 - 15:00**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy\n  - Tyler: Free (next busy at 15:30)\n  - Lisa: Free (next busy at 16:00)\n  - **Conflict**: Laura busy.\n\n- **15:00 - 15:30**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Busy\n  - Laura: Free (next busy at 15:30)\n  - Tyler: Free\n  - Lisa: Free\n  - **Conflict**: Jacqueline busy.\n\n- **15:30 - 16:00**:\n  - Judy: Free\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy\n  - Tyler: Busy\n  - Lisa: Free\n  - **Conflict**: Laura, Tyler busy.\n\n- **16:00 - 16:30**:\n  - Judy: Busy\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy\n  - Tyler: Busy\n  - Lisa: Busy\n  - **Conflict**: Judy, Laura, Tyler, Lisa busy.\n\n- **16:30 - 17:00**:\n  - Judy: Free (busy until 16:30)\n  - Olivia: Free\n  - Eric: Free\n  - Jacqueline: Free\n  - Laura: Busy\n  - Tyler: Busy\n  - Lisa: Busy\n  - **Conflict**: Laura, Tyler, Lisa busy.\n\nSo, the only slot where everyone is free is **13:30 - 14:00**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"13:30:14:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
