To do this, we'll list out their busy times and then look for gaps where none of them have meetings.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Danielle's Meetings:**\n   - 9:00 - 10:00\n   - 10:30 - 11:00\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n   - 15:30 - 16:00\n   - 16:30 - 17:00\n\n2. **Bruce's Meetings:**\n   - 11:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:30 - 13:00\n   - 14:00 - 14:30\n   - 15:30 - 16:00\n\n3. **Eric's Blocked Times:**\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:00 - 11:00\n   - 11:30 - 13:00\n   - 14:30 - 15:30\n\n### Approach:\nWe'll go through each hour slot from 9:00 onwards and check if all three are free for that entire hour.\n\nLet's list potential one-hour slots and check:\n\n1. **9:00 - 10:00:**\n   - Danielle: busy (9:00 - 10:00)\n   - Bruce: free\n   - Eric: busy (9:00 - 9:30 and 10:00 - 11:00 overlaps)\n   - **Not free for all.**\n\n2. **9:30 - 10:30:**\n   - Danielle: free until 10:00, then busy 10:30 - 11:00 (overlaps at 10:30)\n   - Bruce: free\n   - Eric: busy (10:00 - 11:00)\n   - **Not free for all.**\n\n3. **10:00 - 11:00:**\n   - Danielle: busy (10:30 - 11:00)\n   - Bruce: free until 11:00, then busy at 11:00\n   - Eric: busy (10:00 - 11:00)\n   - **Not free for all.**\n\n4. **11:00 - 12:00:**\n   - Danielle: free (last meeting ends at 11:00, next at 14:30)\n   - Bruce: busy (11:00 - 11:30)\n   - Eric: busy (11:30 - 13:00, but also overlaps at 11:00 - 11:30 from previous)\n   - Wait, Eric is busy from 10:00 - 11:00 and then 11:30 - 13:00. So 11:00 - 11:30 is free for Eric?\n     - Actually, Eric's blocked times are:\n       - 9:00 - 9:30\n       - 10:00 - 11:00\n       - 11:30 - 13:00\n     - So from 11:00 - 11:30, Eric is free (since 10:00 - 11:00 ends at 11:00, and next block starts at 11:30).\n   - Bruce is busy 11:00 - 11:30.\n   - So 11:00 - 12:00: Bruce is busy first half, so not entirely free.\n   - **Not free for all.**\n\n5. **11:30 - 12:30:**\n   - Danielle: free\n   - Bruce: free (last meeting at 11:00 - 11:30, next at 12:30 - 13:00)\n   - Eric: busy (11:30 - 13:00)\n   - **Not free for all.**\n\n6. **12:00 - 13:00:**\n   - Danielle: free\n   - Bruce: busy (12:30 - 13:00)\n   - Eric: busy (11:30 - 13:00)\n   - **Not free for all.**\n\n7. **13:00 - 14:00:**\n   - Danielle: free\n   - Bruce: free (last meeting at 12:30 - 13:00, next at 14:00 - 14:30)\n   - Eric: free (last block ends at 13:00, next at 14:30 - 15:30)\n   - **All free for this entire hour!**\n\nLet's verify:\n- Danielle: no meetings between 16:30 - 17:00 is the next, but before that, last was 15:30 - 16:00. Wait, let's see Danielle's schedule:\n  - 16:30 - 17:00 is last, so before that is 15:30 - 16:00, then 14:30 - 15:00, etc.\n  - From 13:00 - 14:00: no meetings listed, so free.\n- Bruce: last before 14:00 is 12:30 - 13:00, then next is 14:00 - 14:30, so 13:00 - 14:00 is free.\n- Eric: last block ends at 13:00, next at 14:30, so 13:00 - 14:00 is free.\n\nPerfect, all three are free from 13:00 - 14:00.\n\n8. **14:00 - 15:00:**\n   - Danielle: free until 14:30, then busy 14:30 - 15:00\n   - Bruce: busy (14:00 - 14:30)\n   - Eric: free until 14:30, then busy\n   - **Not free for all.**\n\n9. **15:00 - 16:00:**\n   - Danielle: busy (15:30 - 16:00)\n   - Bruce: busy (15:30 - 16:00)\n   - Eric: busy (14:30 - 15:30)\n   - **Not free for all.**\n\n10. **16:00 - 17:00:**\n    - Danielle: busy (16:30 - 17:00)\n    - Bruce: free (last meeting at 15:30 - 16:00)\n    - Eric: free (last block ends at 15:30)\n    - But Danielle is busy from 16:30, so 16:00 - 17:00 is not entirely free for her.\n    - **Not free for all.**\n\nFrom the above, the only one-hour slot where all three are free is **13:00 - 14:00**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"13:00:14:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
