I'm going to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 that works for Margaret, Donna, and Helen, considering all their existing commitments and Helen's preference not to meet after 13:30.\n\n### Understanding the Constraints\n\nFirst, let's summarize everyone's blocked times and preferences:\n\n1. **Margaret's blocked times on Monday:**\n   - 9:00 - 10:00\n   - 10:30 - 11:00\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n\n2. **Donna's blocked times on Monday:**\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n3. **Helen's blocked times on Monday:**\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:00 - 11:30\n   - 13:00 - 14:00\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n   - 15:30 - 17:00\n   - **Additional preference:** Doesn't want to meet after 13:30.\n\n### Helen's Preference\n\nHelen doesn't want to meet after 13:30, so we're limited to times before 13:30. This significantly narrows down our options.\n\n### Possible Time Slots Before 13:30\n\nLet's look at the available time slots from 9:00 to 13:30 and see when all three are free.\n\nWe'll go hour by hour:\n\n1. **9:00 - 10:00:**\n   - Margaret: blocked (9:00 - 10:00)\n   - Donna: free\n   - Helen: blocked (9:00 - 9:30), then free from 9:30 - 10:00\n   - But Margaret is blocked the entire hour, so no slot here.\n\n2. **10:00 - 11:00:**\n   - Margaret: free from 10:00 - 10:30, then blocked 10:30 - 11:00\n   - Donna: free\n   - Helen: blocked 10:00 - 11:30\n   - Helen is entirely blocked, so no slot here.\n\n3. **11:00 - 12:00:**\n   - Margaret: free from 11:00 - 11:30, then blocked 11:30 - 12:00\n   - Donna: free\n   - Helen: blocked until 11:30, then free from 11:30 - 12:00\n   - Possible overlap: 11:30 - 12:00\n     - Margaret: blocked 11:30 - 12:00\n     - So no overlap here.\n\n4. **12:00 - 13:00:**\n   - Margaret: free (no blocks in this hour)\n   - Donna: free\n   - Helen: free (her last block before 13:00 is 10:00 - 11:30, then next is 13:00 - 14:00)\n   - So Helen is free from 11:30 - 13:00\n   - Entire hour is free for all:\n     - 12:00 - 12:30\n     - 12:30 - 13:00\n   - Both slots work, but let's check if there are any other constraints.\n\n5. **13:00 - 13:30:**\n   - Margaret: blocked (13:00 - 13:30)\n   - Donna: free\n   - Helen: blocked (13:00 - 14:00)\n   - So no slot here.\n\nFrom the above, the only available slots are:\n- 12:00 - 12:30\n- 12:30 - 13:00\n\nBoth are valid, but since the problem states there's a solution that works, either is fine. Let's pick the first one.\n\n### Verifying 12:00 - 12:30:\n\n- **Margaret:**\n  - Blocks: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-15:30\n  - 12:00-12:30 is free.\n  \n- **Donna:**\n  - Blocks: 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30\n  - 12:00-12:30 is free.\n  \n- **Helen:**\n  - Blocks: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:30, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00\n  - 12:00-12:30 is free.\n  - Also, it's before 13:30, so meets her preference.\n\nAll three are free at this time, and it meets all constraints.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"12:00:12:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
