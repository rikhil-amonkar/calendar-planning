We need to find a one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 (that's 9 AM to 5 PM) on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday where both Betty and Megan are available. Additionally, Betty cannot meet on Wednesday or Thursday, so we can immediately rule out those days. That leaves us with Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.\n\n### Available Days:\n1. Monday\n2. Tuesday\n3. Friday\n\nNow, let's look at each day one by one to find a one-hour slot where both Betty and Megan are free.\n\n#### 1. Monday:\n- **Betty's Busy Times on Monday:**\n  - 10:00-10:30\n  - 11:30-12:30\n  - 16:00-16:30\n- **Megan's Busy Times on Monday:**\n  - 9:00-17:00 (entire day blocked)\n\nMegan is completely busy all day on Monday, so no meeting can happen on Monday.\n\n#### 2. Tuesday:\n- **Betty's Busy Times on Tuesday:**\n  - 9:30-10:00\n  - 10:30-11:00\n  - 12:00-12:30\n  - 13:30-15:00\n  - 16:30-17:00\n- **Megan's Busy Times on Tuesday:**\n  - 9:00-9:30\n  - 10:00-10:30\n  - 12:00-14:00\n  - 15:00-15:30\n  - 16:00-16:30\n\nNow, let's find the free slots for both on Tuesday.\n\n**Betty's Free Slots on Tuesday:**\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 11:00-11:30 (since 10:30-11:00 is busy, but 11:00-11:30 is free)\n- 12:30-13:30 (from 12:30 to 13:30, but 13:30 is start of next busy)\n- 15:00-16:30 (but 16:30-17:00 is busy, so up to 16:30)\n\nWait, let's list the busy times in order to see the free gaps:\n\nBetty's busy on Tuesday:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 12:00-12:30\n- 13:30-15:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nSo free times are:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 11:00-12:00 (since 10:30-11:00 busy, next is 12:00-12:30)\n- 12:30-13:30\n- 15:00-16:30\n\nNow, Megan's busy on Tuesday:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 12:00-14:00\n- 15:00-15:30\n- 16:00-16:30\n\nMegan's free times:\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:30-12:00\n- 14:00-15:00\n- 15:30-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nNow, find overlaps between Betty's free and Megan's free:\n\n1. Betty: 9:00-9:30\n   Megan: 9:30-10:00\n   No overlap.\n\n2. Betty: 10:00-10:30\n   Megan: 10:30-12:00\n   No overlap (Betty's 10:00-10:30 overlaps with Megan's 10:00-10:30 busy).\n\n3. Betty: 11:00-12:00\n   Megan: 10:30-12:00\n   Overlap: 11:00-12:00\n   But Betty is free 11:00-12:00, Megan is free 10:30-12:00 except 12:00-14:00 starts at 12:00, so Megan is free until 12:00.\n   So both free 11:00-12:00.\n   But meeting is 1 hour, so possible slots:\n   - 11:00-12:00\n\nBut let's check if there are any conflicts within 11:00-12:00:\n- Betty: free 11:00-12:00\n- Megan: free 10:30-12:00\nNo conflicts, so 11:00-12:00 is possible.\n\nBut let's check other possible overlaps to see if there's another slot.\n\n4. Betty: 12:30-13:30\n   Megan: 14:00-15:00\n   No overlap.\n\n5. Betty: 15:00-16:30\n   Megan: 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n   Overlaps:\n   - 15:30-16:00\n     Betty is free (15:00-16:30), Megan is free 15:30-16:00\n     So 15:30-16:00 is 30 minutes, but we need 1 hour.\n   - Next is 16:00-16:30\n     Betty is free, but Megan is busy 16:00-16:30\n   - 16:30-17:00\n     Betty is busy 16:30-17:00\nSo no full hour overlap here.\n\nThus, the only possible 1-hour slot on Tuesday is 11:00-12:00.\n\nBut let's check if there are any other days.\n\n#### 3. Friday:\n- **Betty's Busy Times on Friday:**\n  - 9:00-10:00\n  - 11:30-12:00\n  - 12:30-13:00\n  - 14:30-15:00\n- **Megan's Busy Times on Friday:**\n  - 9:00-17:00 (entire day blocked)\n\nMegan is completely busy all day on Friday, so no meeting can happen on Friday.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only possible day is Tuesday, and the only 1-hour slot where both are free is 11:00-12:00.\n\nLet me double-check that:\n- Betty on Tuesday 11:00-12:00:\n  - Busy at 10:30-11:00 (so free from 11:00)\n  - Next busy at 12:00-12:30\n  - So free 11:00-12:00\n- Megan on Tuesday 11:00-12:00:\n  - Busy at 10:00-10:30, then free until 12:00\n  - Next busy at 12:00-14:00\n  - So free 10:30-12:00\n  - So 11:00-12:00 is within 10:30-12:00, free.\n\nNo conflicts, both free.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"11:00:12:00\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```",
