We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday when none of them have any other meetings or busy times.\n\n### Step 1: List All Busy Times for Each Participant\n\nFirst, let's list out all the times when each person is busy on Monday:\n\n1. **Patrick**:\n   - 13:30 - 14:00\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n\n2. **Shirley**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 11:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n   - 16:00 - 17:00\n\n3. **Jeffrey**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:30 - 11:00\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 16:00 - 17:00\n\n4. **Gloria**:\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n\n5. **Nathan**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:30 - 12:00\n   - 14:00 - 17:00\n\n6. **Angela**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:00 - 11:00\n   - 12:30 - 15:00\n   - 15:30 - 16:30\n\n7. **David**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:00 - 10:30\n   - 11:00 - 14:00\n   - 14:30 - 16:30\n\n### Step 2: Identify Common Free Times\n\nNow, we'll look for a 30-minute window where none of these busy times overlap. Let's go through the day in order:\n\n- **9:00 - 9:30**: Almost everyone is busy (Patrick, Shirley, Jeffrey, Nathan, Angela, David). Gloria is free, but others aren't. \u2192 Not available.\n  \n- **9:30 - 10:00**:\n  - Patrick: free\n  - Shirley: free (last meeting at 9:30)\n  - Jeffrey: free (last meeting at 9:30)\n  - Gloria: free\n  - Nathan: free (last meeting at 9:30)\n  - Angela: free (last meeting at 9:30)\n  - David: free (last meeting at 9:30)\n  \n  **All free from 9:30 - 10:00**. But let's check if there's a better time later in the day since this is early.\n\n- **10:00 - 10:30**:\n  - Angela: busy (10:00 - 11:00)\n  - David: busy (10:00 - 10:30)\n  \n  \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **10:30 - 11:00**:\n  - Jeffrey: busy (10:30 - 11:00)\n  - Nathan: busy (10:30 - 12:00)\n  - Angela: busy (10:00 - 11:00)\n  - David: free after 10:30, but has 11:00 - 14:00\n  \n  \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **11:00 - 11:30**:\n  - Shirley: busy (11:00 - 11:30)\n  - Nathan: busy (10:30 - 12:00)\n  - Angela: busy (10:00 - 11:00, but overlaps)\n  - David: busy (11:00 - 14:00)\n  \n  \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **11:30 - 12:00**:\n  - Jeffrey: busy (11:30 - 12:00)\n  - Gloria: busy (11:30 - 12:00)\n  - Nathan: busy (10:30 - 12:00)\n  - David: busy (11:00 - 14:00)\n  \n  \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **12:00 - 12:30**:\n  - Shirley: busy (12:00 - 12:30)\n  - Nathan: busy (10:30 - 12:00, but ends at 12:00)\n  - Angela: free until 12:30\n  - David: busy (11:00 - 14:00)\n  \n  \u2192 David is busy \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **12:30 - 13:00**:\n  - Angela: busy (12:30 - 15:00)\n  - David: busy (11:00 - 14:00)\n  \n  \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **13:00 - 13:30**:\n  - Jeffrey: busy (13:00 - 13:30)\n  - Angela: busy (12:30 - 15:00)\n  - David: busy (11:00 - 14:00)\n  \n  \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **13:30 - 14:00**:\n  - Patrick: busy (13:30 - 14:00)\n  - Angela: busy (12:30 - 15:00)\n  - David: busy (11:00 - 14:00)\n  \n  \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **14:00 - 14:30**:\n  - Nathan: busy (14:00 - 17:00)\n  - Angela: busy (12:30 - 15:00)\n  - David: free (14:00 - 14:30, then busy)\n  \n  \u2192 Nathan is busy \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **14:30 - 15:00**:\n  - Patrick: busy (14:30 - 15:00)\n  - Shirley: busy (14:30 - 15:00)\n  - Nathan: busy (14:00 - 17:00)\n  - Angela: busy (12:30 - 15:00)\n  - David: busy (14:30 - 16:30)\n  \n  \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **15:00 - 15:30**:\n  - Gloria: busy (15:00 - 15:30)\n  - Nathan: busy (14:00 - 17:00)\n  - Angela: busy (12:30 - 15:00, but ends at 15:00)\n  - David: busy (14:30 - 16:30)\n  \n  \u2192 Gloria and Nathan are busy \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **15:30 - 16:00**:\n  - Angela: busy (15:30 - 16:30)\n  - David: busy (14:30 - 16:30)\n  - Nathan: busy (14:00 - 17:00)\n  \n  \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **16:00 - 16:30**:\n  - Shirley: busy (16:00 - 17:00)\n  - Jeffrey: busy (16:00 - 17:00)\n  - Angela: busy (15:30 - 16:30)\n  - David: busy (14:30 - 16:30)\n  - Nathan: busy (14:00 - 17:00)\n  \n  \u2192 Not available.\n\n- **16:30 - 17:00**:\n  - Shirley: busy (16:00 - 17:00)\n  - Jeffrey: busy (16:00 - 17:00)\n  - Nathan: busy (14:00 - 17:00)\n  - David: free (ends at 16:30)\n  \n  \u2192 Shirley, Jeffrey, Nathan are busy \u2192 Not available.\n\n### Step 3: Re-evaluate Early Time Slots\n\nFrom the above, the only time slot where everyone is free is **9:30 - 10:00**. Let me double-check this:\n\n- **Patrick**: Free (no meetings until 13:30)\n- **Shirley**: Free (last meeting at 9:00 - 9:30)\n- **Jeffrey**: Free (last meeting at 9:00 - 9:30)\n- **Gloria**: Free (no conflicts)\n- **Nathan**: Free (last meeting at 9:00 - 9:30)\n- **Angela**: Free (last meeting at 9:00 - 9:30)\n- **David**: Free (last meeting at 9:00 - 9:30)\n\nIndeed, this is the only 30-minute window where all seven participants are free.\n\n### Step 4: Verify No Other Slots\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see if there's any other possible time:\n\n- After 10:00, Angela and David are busy until later, and then others have conflicts.\n- From 12:30 onwards, Angela is mostly busy until 15:00, and David is busy until 14:00, Nathan until 17:00, etc.\n- The only clear window is 9:30 - 10:00.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"09:30:10:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
