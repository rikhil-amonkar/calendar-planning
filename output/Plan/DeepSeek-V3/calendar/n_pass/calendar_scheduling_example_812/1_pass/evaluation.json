We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday where both Mary and Alexis are free. The preference is to meet at their earliest availability, meaning we should look for the earliest possible time that fits.\n\n### Understanding the Schedules\n\nFirst, let's list out the busy times for each person on each day.\n\n#### Mary's Busy Times:\n- **Tuesday**: \n  - 10:00 - 10:30\n  - 15:30 - 16:00\n- **Wednesday**: \n  - 9:30 - 10:00\n  - 15:00 - 15:30\n- **Thursday**: \n  - 9:00 - 10:00\n  - 10:30 - 11:30\n\nMary has no meetings on Monday, so she's free all day Monday from 9:00 to 17:00.\n\n#### Alexis's Busy Times:\n- **Monday**: \n  - 9:00 - 10:00\n  - 10:30 - 12:00\n  - 12:30 - 16:30\n- **Tuesday**: \n  - 9:00 - 10:00\n  - 10:30 - 11:30\n  - 12:00 - 15:30\n  - 16:00 - 17:00\n- **Wednesday**: \n  - 9:00 - 11:00\n  - 11:30 - 17:00\n- **Thursday**: \n  - 10:00 - 12:00\n  - 14:00 - 14:30\n  - 15:30 - 16:00\n  - 16:30 - 17:00\n\n### Finding Available Slots\n\nWe'll go through each day to find a 30-minute window where both are free.\n\n#### Monday:\n- Mary is free all day.\n- Alexis's busy times:\n  - 9:00 - 10:00\n  - 10:30 - 12:00\n  - 12:30 - 16:30\nSo, Alexis's free times on Monday:\n  - 10:00 - 10:30\n  - 12:00 - 12:30\n  - 16:30 - 17:00\n\nNow, check these against Mary's schedule (she's free all day on Monday):\n1. 10:00 - 10:30: Alexis is free, Mary is free.\n   - This is a potential slot.\n2. 12:00 - 12:30: Both free.\n3. 16:30 - 17:00: Both free.\n\nThe earliest available slot is 10:00 - 10:30.\n\nBut let's check other days to ensure there isn't an earlier slot on another day.\n\n#### Tuesday:\nMary's busy:\n- 10:00 - 10:30\n- 15:30 - 16:00\n\nAlexis's busy:\n- 9:00 - 10:00\n- 10:30 - 11:30\n- 12:00 - 15:30\n- 16:00 - 17:00\n\nFree times when both are free:\nBetween 10:00 - 10:30: Mary is busy.\nBetween 10:30 - 11:30: Alexis is busy.\nBetween 11:30 - 12:00: \n   - Mary is free.\n   - Alexis is free (from 11:30 - 12:00).\n   - So, 11:30 - 12:00 is a possible slot.\nBetween 15:30 - 16:00: Mary is busy.\nBetween 16:00 - 17:00: Alexis is busy.\n\nSo, possible slot on Tuesday: 11:30 - 12:00.\n\nBut on Monday, we have 10:00 - 10:30, which is earlier than 11:30 - 12:00 on Tuesday.\n\n#### Wednesday:\nMary's busy:\n- 9:30 - 10:00\n- 15:00 - 15:30\n\nAlexis's busy:\n- 9:00 - 11:00\n- 11:30 - 17:00\n\nFree times when both are free:\nBetween 9:00 - 9:30:\n   - Mary is free (no meetings until 9:30).\n   - Alexis is busy until 11:00.\nBetween 11:00 - 11:30:\n   - Mary is free.\n   - Alexis is free (from 11:00 - 11:30).\n   - So, 11:00 - 11:30 is a possible slot.\nBetween 15:30 - 17:00: Alexis is busy.\n\nPossible slot: 11:00 - 11:30.\n\nBut Monday has 10:00 - 10:30, which is earlier.\n\n#### Thursday:\nMary's busy:\n- 9:00 - 10:00\n- 10:30 - 11:30\n\nAlexis's busy:\n- 10:00 - 12:00\n- 14:00 - 14:30\n- 15:30 - 16:00\n- 16:30 - 17:00\n\nFree times when both are free:\nBetween 9:00 - 10:00: Mary is busy.\nBetween 10:00 - 10:30:\n   - Mary is free (from 10:00 - 10:30).\n   - Alexis is busy (from 10:00 - 12:00).\nBetween 12:00 - 14:00:\n   - Mary is free.\n   - Alexis is free.\n   - So, possible slots here, e.g., 12:00 - 12:30.\nBetween 14:00 - 14:30: Alexis is busy.\nBetween 14:30 - 15:30:\n   - Mary is free.\n   - Alexis is free.\n   - Possible slot: 14:30 - 15:00.\nBetween 15:30 - 16:00: Alexis is busy.\nBetween 16:00 - 16:30:\n   - Mary is free.\n   - Alexis is free.\n   - Possible slot: 16:00 - 16:30.\n\nEarliest on Thursday is 12:00 - 12:30, which is later than Monday's 10:00 - 10:30.\n\n### Comparing All Days:\n- Monday: 10:00 - 10:30\n- Tuesday: 11:30 - 12:00\n- Wednesday: 11:00 - 11:30\n- Thursday: 12:00 - 12:30\n\nThe earliest available slot is on Monday from 10:00 - 10:30.\n\n### Verifying Monday 10:00 - 10:30:\n- Mary:\n  - Monday: no meetings, so free.\n- Alexis:\n  - Monday:\n    - 9:00 - 10:00: busy\n    - 10:00 - 10:30: free (since next busy is 10:30 - 12:00)\n    - So, 10:00 - 10:30 is free.\n\nBoth are free at this time, and it's the earliest possible slot across all days.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"10:00:10:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
