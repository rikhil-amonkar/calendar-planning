We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday where all six participants\u2014Doris, Theresa, Christian, Terry, Carolyn, and Kyle\u2014are available. \n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's busy times to see where the overlaps are, and then find a gap where none of them are busy.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Doris**:\n   - 9:00 - 11:00\n   - 13:30 - 14:00\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n2. **Theresa**:\n   - 10:00 - 12:00\n\n3. **Christian**:\n   - No meetings (completely free)\n\n4. **Terry**:\n   - 9:30 - 10:00\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 12:30 - 13:00\n   - 13:30 - 14:00\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n   - 15:30 - 17:00\n\n5. **Carolyn**:\n   - 9:00 - 10:30\n   - 11:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:00 - 13:00\n   - 13:30 - 14:30\n   - 15:00 - 17:00\n\n6. **Kyle**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 11:30 - 12:00\n   - 12:30 - 13:00\n   - 14:30 - 17:00\n\n### Approach:\n\nTo find a common free slot, we'll look at the entire workday (9:00 - 17:00) and check for intervals where none of the above busy times overlap. \n\nLet's break down the day into possible slots and see which one is free for all.\n\n#### Potential Time Slots to Check:\n\nWe'll look at the time in 30-minute increments and see if that slot is free for everyone.\n\n1. **9:00 - 9:30**:\n   - Doris: busy (9:00 - 11:00)\n   - Carolyn: busy (9:00 - 10:30)\n   - Kyle: busy (9:00 - 9:30)\n   - **Not free**\n\n2. **9:30 - 10:00**:\n   - Doris: busy\n   - Terry: busy (9:30 - 10:00)\n   - Carolyn: busy\n   - **Not free**\n\n3. **10:00 - 10:30**:\n   - Doris: busy\n   - Theresa: busy (10:00 - 12:00)\n   - Carolyn: busy\n   - **Not free**\n\n4. **10:30 - 11:00**:\n   - Doris: busy\n   - Theresa: busy\n   - Carolyn: free (after 10:30)\n   - But Doris and Theresa are busy\n   - **Not free**\n\n5. **11:00 - 11:30**:\n   - Doris: busy\n   - Theresa: busy\n   - Carolyn: busy (11:00 - 11:30)\n   - **Not free**\n\n6. **11:30 - 12:00**:\n   - Doris: free (after 11:00, next busy at 13:30)\n   - Theresa: busy\n   - Terry: busy (11:30 - 12:00)\n   - Carolyn: busy (until 11:30, then next at 12:00)\n   - Kyle: busy (11:30 - 12:00)\n   - **Not free**\n\n7. **12:00 - 12:30**:\n   - Doris: free\n   - Theresa: free (after 12:00)\n   - Terry: free (last busy until 12:00, next at 12:30)\n   - Carolyn: busy (12:00 - 13:00)\n   - Kyle: free (last busy until 12:00, next at 12:30)\n   - Carolyn is busy\n   - **Not free**\n\n8. **12:30 - 13:00**:\n   - Doris: free\n   - Theresa: free\n   - Terry: busy (12:30 - 13:00)\n   - Carolyn: busy\n   - Kyle: busy (12:30 - 13:00)\n   - **Not free**\n\n9. **13:00 - 13:30**:\n   - Doris: free\n   - Theresa: free\n   - Terry: free (last busy until 13:00, next at 13:30)\n   - Carolyn: free (last busy until 13:00, next at 13:30)\n   - Kyle: free (last busy until 13:00, next at 14:30)\n   - **All free!**\n   - But let's check the exact times:\n     - 13:00 - 13:30:\n       - Doris: free\n       - Theresa: free\n       - Terry: free\n       - Carolyn: free\n       - Kyle: free\n       - Christian: always free\n     - No overlaps with busy times.\n     - Perfect!\n\n10. **13:30 - 14:00**:\n    - Doris: busy (13:30 - 14:00)\n    - Terry: busy\n    - Carolyn: busy\n    - Kyle: free until 14:30\n    - **Not free**\n\n11. **14:00 - 14:30**:\n    - Doris: free (after 14:00)\n    - Terry: free (last busy until 14:00, next at 14:30)\n    - Carolyn: busy (13:30 - 14:30)\n    - Kyle: free until 14:30\n    - Carolyn is busy\n    - **Not free**\n\n12. **14:30 - 15:00**:\n    - Doris: free\n    - Terry: busy (14:30 - 15:00)\n    - Carolyn: busy (15:00 - 17:00, but overlaps)\n    - Kyle: busy (14:30 - 17:00)\n    - **Not free**\n\n13. **15:00 - 15:30**:\n    - Doris: free\n    - Terry: free (last busy until 15:00, next at 15:30)\n    - Carolyn: busy\n    - Kyle: busy\n    - **Not free**\n\n14. **15:30 - 16:00**:\n    - Doris: free until 16:00\n    - Terry: busy (15:30 - 17:00)\n    - Carolyn: busy\n    - Kyle: busy\n    - **Not free**\n\n15. **16:00 - 16:30**:\n    - Doris: busy (16:00 - 16:30)\n    - Terry: busy\n    - Carolyn: busy\n    - Kyle: busy\n    - **Not free**\n\n16. **16:30 - 17:00**:\n    - Doris: free (after 16:30)\n    - Terry: busy\n    - Carolyn: busy\n    - Kyle: busy\n    - **Not free**\n\n### Verifying the Free Slot:\n\nFrom the above, the only 30-minute slot where everyone is free is **13:00 - 13:30**.\n\nLet's double-check each participant at this time:\n\n- **Doris**: Not busy between 11:00 - 13:30 and 14:00 - 16:00 \u2192 Free at 13:00 - 13:30\n- **Theresa**: Only busy 10:00 - 12:00 \u2192 Free after 12:00\n- **Christian**: Always free\n- **Terry**: Last busy until 13:00, next at 13:30 \u2192 Free at 13:00 - 13:30\n- **Carolyn**: Last busy until 13:00, next at 13:30 \u2192 Free at 13:00 - 13:30\n- **Kyle**: Last busy until 13:00, next at 14:30 \u2192 Free at 13:00 - 13:30\n\nAll are free during this time!\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"13:00:13:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
