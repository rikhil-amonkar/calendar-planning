I'll go through each day and look for a one-hour window where both Patricia and Jesse are free between 9:00 and 17:00.\n\n### Monday:\nFirst, let's list out Patricia's and Jesse's schedules on Monday.\n\n**Patricia's Monday Schedule:**\n1. 10:00 - 10:30\n2. 11:30 - 12:00\n3. 13:00 - 13:30\n4. 14:30 - 15:30\n5. 16:00 - 16:30\n\n**Jesse's Monday Schedule:**\n- Blocked from 9:00 to 17:00 (entire workday)\n\nWait a minute, Jesse's calendar is completely blocked on Monday from 9:00 to 17:00. That means there's no time on Monday when Jesse is available. So, Monday is out.\n\n### Tuesday:\nNow, let's check Tuesday.\n\n**Patricia's Tuesday Schedule:**\n1. 10:00 - 10:30\n2. 11:00 - 12:00\n3. 14:00 - 16:00\n4. 16:30 - 17:00\n\n**Jesse's Tuesday Schedule:**\n1. 11:00 - 11:30\n2. 12:00 - 12:30\n3. 13:00 - 14:00\n4. 14:30 - 15:00\n5. 15:30 - 17:00\n\nNow, let's find the gaps where both are free on Tuesday between 9:00 and 17:00.\n\nFirst, let's list the busy times for both on Tuesday:\n\n**Patricia's Busy Times:**\n- 10:00 - 10:30\n- 11:00 - 12:00\n- 14:00 - 16:00\n- 16:30 - 17:00\n\n**Jesse's Busy Times:**\n- 11:00 - 11:30\n- 12:00 - 12:30\n- 13:00 - 14:00\n- 14:30 - 15:00\n- 15:30 - 17:00\n\nNow, let's find the free times for each:\n\n**Patricia's Free Times on Tuesday:**\nFrom 9:00 to 17:00, excluding her busy times:\n1. 9:00 - 10:00\n2. 10:30 - 11:00\n3. 12:00 - 14:00 (but she's free from 12:00 - 14:00, but Jesse has 12:00 - 12:30 and 13:00 - 14:00)\n4. 16:00 - 16:30\n\n**Jesse's Free Times on Tuesday:**\nFrom 9:00 to 17:00, excluding his busy times:\n1. 9:00 - 11:00\n2. 11:30 - 12:00\n3. 12:30 - 13:00\n4. 14:00 - 14:30\n5. 15:00 - 15:30\n\nNow, let's find overlaps where both are free for at least one hour.\n\n1. **9:00 - 10:00**:\n   - Patricia: Free\n   - Jesse: Free (9:00 - 11:00)\n   - Overlap: 9:00 - 10:00 (1 hour)\n   - This works!\n\n2. **10:30 - 11:00**:\n   - Patricia: Free\n   - Jesse: Free until 11:00\n   - Overlap: 10:30 - 11:00 (only 30 minutes)\n   - Not enough.\n\n3. **12:00 - 14:00**:\n   - Patricia is free, but:\n     - 12:00 - 12:30: Jesse is busy (12:00 - 12:30)\n     - 12:30 - 13:00: Both free (30 minutes)\n     - 13:00 - 14:00: Jesse busy\n   - No full hour here.\n\n4. **16:00 - 16:30**:\n   - Patricia: Free\n   - Jesse: Busy until 17:00\n   - No overlap.\n\nOther potential overlaps:\n\n- **14:00 - 14:30**:\n  - Patricia is busy until 16:00\n  - Jesse is free from 14:00 - 14:30\n  - Patricia is not free.\n\n- **15:00 - 15:30**:\n  - Patricia is busy until 16:00\n  - Jesse is free from 15:00 - 15:30\n  - Patricia is not free.\n\nSo, the only one-hour window where both are free is **9:00 - 10:00 on Tuesday**.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Patricia on Tuesday:\n  - No meetings at 9:00 - 10:00.\n- Jesse on Tuesday:\n  - No blocks at 9:00 - 10:00.\n\nBoth are free during this time, and it's within work hours (9:00 - 17:00).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"09:00:10:00\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```",
