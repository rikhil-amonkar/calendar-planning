We need to find a one-hour slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 where both James and John are free. \n\nFirst, let's list out the busy times for both James and John on Monday:\n\n**James' Busy Times:**\n1. 11:30 to 12:00\n2. 14:30 to 15:00\n\n**John's Busy Times:**\n1. 9:30 to 11:00\n2. 11:30 to 12:00\n3. 12:30 to 13:30\n4. 14:30 to 16:30\n\nNow, let's visualize the available times for each by subtracting their busy times from the workday (9:00 to 17:00).\n\n**James' Available Times:**\n- 9:00 to 11:30\n- 12:00 to 14:30\n- 15:00 to 17:00\n\n**John's Available Times:**\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 11:00 to 11:30\n- 12:00 to 12:30\n- 13:30 to 14:30\n- 16:30 to 17:00\n\nNow, we need to find overlapping one-hour slots where both are free.\n\nLet's look at James' available blocks and see if there's a one-hour overlap with John's availability.\n\n1. **James: 9:00 - 11:30**\n   - John is free from 9:00 - 9:30 and 11:00 - 11:30.\n   - Possible overlaps:\n     - 9:00 - 10:00: But John is busy from 9:30, so only 9:00 - 9:30 is free for both, which is only 30 minutes. Need 1 hour.\n     - 11:00 - 11:30: Only 30 minutes, not enough.\n\n2. **James: 12:00 - 14:30**\n   - John is free from 12:00 - 12:30 and 13:30 - 14:30.\n   - Possible overlaps:\n     - 12:00 - 13:00: John is free until 12:30, then busy until 13:30. So 12:00 - 12:30 is free (30 minutes), then 13:00 - 13:30 is busy for John. Doesn't work.\n     - 13:00 - 14:00: \n       - James is free until 14:30.\n       - John is free from 13:30 - 14:30.\n       - So 13:30 - 14:00 is free for both (30 minutes), but we need a full hour starting at 13:30 would go to 14:30, which is within James' free time (until 14:30) and John is free 13:30 - 14:30. \n       - Wait, 13:30 - 14:30 is a full hour where both are free.\n       - James is free 12:00 - 14:30, so 13:30 - 14:30 is within that.\n       - John is free 13:30 - 14:30.\n       - Perfect! This is a one-hour slot where both are free.\n\n3. **James: 15:00 - 17:00**\n   - John is busy until 16:30, then free 16:30 - 17:00.\n   - Possible overlaps:\n     - 16:00 - 17:00: John is free from 16:30, so only 16:30 - 17:00 is free (30 minutes).\n     - Not enough.\n\nSo, the only one-hour slot where both are free is **13:30 - 14:30**.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- James:\n  - Not busy at 13:30 - 14:30 (busy at 14:30 - 15:00, but that's after).\n- John:\n  - Free from 13:30 - 14:30 (next busy is 14:30 - 16:30).\n\nYes, both are free from 13:30 - 14:30.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"13:30:14:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
