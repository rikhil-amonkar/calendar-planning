We need to find a one-hour time slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday where both Patrick and Roy are available. Patrick's calendar is completely open, so we only need to consider Roy's busy times to find when he's free.\n\n### Understanding Roy's Busy Times\n\nFirst, let's list out Roy's busy times on each day:\n\n**Monday:**\n1. 10:00 - 11:30\n2. 12:00 - 13:00\n3. 14:00 - 14:30\n4. 15:00 - 17:00\n\n**Tuesday:**\n1. 10:30 - 11:30\n2. 12:00 - 14:30\n3. 15:00 - 15:30\n4. 16:00 - 17:00\n\n**Wednesday:**\n1. 9:30 - 11:30\n2. 12:30 - 14:00\n3. 14:30 - 15:30\n4. 16:30 - 17:00\n\n### Finding Available Slots\n\nWe'll look for one-hour gaps where Roy isn't busy on each day, starting from the earliest possible time (9:00) to the latest (17:00).\n\n#### Monday:\n- Before 10:00: 9:00 - 10:00 (1 hour) \u2192 Available\n- Between 11:30 and 12:00: 11:30 - 12:00 (only 30 minutes) \u2192 Too short\n- Between 13:00 and 14:00: 13:00 - 14:00 (1 hour) \u2192 Available\n- Between 14:30 and 15:00: 14:30 - 15:00 (only 30 minutes) \u2192 Too short\n- After 15:00, busy until 17:00 \u2192 No availability\n\nAvailable slots on Monday:\n1. 9:00 - 10:00\n2. 13:00 - 14:00\n\n#### Tuesday:\n- Before 10:30: 9:00 - 10:30 (1.5 hours) \u2192 Can take 9:00 - 10:00\n- Between 11:30 and 12:00: 11:30 - 12:00 (30 minutes) \u2192 Too short\n- Between 14:30 and 15:00: 14:30 - 15:00 (30 minutes) \u2192 Too short\n- Between 15:30 and 16:00: 15:30 - 16:00 (30 minutes) \u2192 Too short\n- After 16:00, busy until 17:00 \u2192 No availability\n\nAvailable slots on Tuesday:\n1. 9:00 - 10:00\n   - But Roy is free from 9:00 - 10:30, so 9:00 - 10:00 is valid.\n   - However, the next earliest is after 14:30, but the next full hour is 14:30 - 15:30, but Roy is busy from 15:00 - 15:30, so only 14:30 - 15:00 (30 minutes) is free, which isn't enough.\n   - Wait, between 14:30 and 15:00 is 30 minutes, then 15:00 - 15:30 is busy, then 15:30 - 16:00 is 30 minutes, then 16:00 - 17:00 is busy.\n   - So no full hour available after 9:00 - 10:00 on Tuesday.\n\nWait, let me re-examine Tuesday:\nRoy's busy on Tuesday:\n- 10:30 - 11:30\n- 12:00 - 14:30\n- 15:00 - 15:30\n- 16:00 - 17:00\n\nFree periods:\n- 9:00 - 10:30 (but 10:00 - 10:30 is overlapping with busy at 10:30, but 9:00 - 10:00 is fully free)\n- 11:30 - 12:00 (30 min)\n- 14:30 - 15:00 (30 min)\n- 15:30 - 16:00 (30 min)\n\nSo the only full hour is 9:00 - 10:00.\n\n#### Wednesday:\n- Before 9:30: 9:00 - 9:30 (30 minutes) \u2192 Too short\n- Between 11:30 and 12:30: 11:30 - 12:30 (1 hour) \u2192 Available\n- Between 14:00 and 14:30: 14:00 - 14:30 (30 minutes) \u2192 Too short\n- Between 15:30 and 16:30: 15:30 - 16:30 (1 hour) \u2192 Available\n- After 16:30, busy until 17:00 \u2192 No availability\n\nAvailable slots on Wednesday:\n1. 11:30 - 12:30\n2. 15:30 - 16:30\n\n### Determining the Earliest Availability\n\nNow, let's list all available one-hour slots in order:\n\n1. Monday: 9:00 - 10:00\n2. Monday: 13:00 - 14:00\n3. Tuesday: 9:00 - 10:00\n4. Wednesday: 11:30 - 12:30\n5. Wednesday: 15:30 - 16:30\n\nThe earliest available slot is Monday at 9:00 - 10:00.\n\n### Verifying Patrick's Availability\n\nPatrick's calendar is wide open, so any of these slots work for him. Therefore, the earliest possible meeting time is Monday from 9:00 to 10:00.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"09:00:10:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
