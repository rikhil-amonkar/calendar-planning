You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Andrew, Grace and Samuel for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAndrew's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nGracehas no meetings the whole day.\nSamuel has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}\n\nFor example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"

        "content": "To find the earliest available time slot for the meeting between Andrew, Grace, and Samuel on Monday, we need to look for a 30-minute window where all three are free. \n\nGiven:\n- Andrew is free all day.\n- Grace is free all day.\n- Samuel's busy times on Monday are: 9:00-10:30, 11:30-12:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n\nWe can identify the available slots for Samuel by looking at the gaps between his busy times:\n1. 10:30-11:30 (1 hour)\n2. 12:00-13:00 (1 hour)\n3. 13:30-14:00 (30 minutes)\n4. 16:00-16:30 (30 minutes)\n\nThe earliest available 30-minute slot in these gaps is **10:30-11:00**. \n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"10:30:11:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
