To do this, I'll list out each person's busy times and then look for gaps where none of them are busy.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Julie's Busy Times:**\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 11:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:30 - 14:00\n   - 16:00 - 17:00\n\n2. **Sean's Busy Times:**\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n3. **Lori's Busy Times:**\n   - 10:00 - 10:30\n   - 11:00 - 13:00\n   - 15:30 - 17:00\n\n### Approach:\n\nTo find a common free slot, I'll go through each hour of the day from 9:00 to 17:00 and check if all three are free for that hour. \n\nLet's list the possible one-hour slots and check for conflicts:\n\n1. **9:00 - 10:00:**\n   - Julie: busy 9:00 - 9:30\n   - Sean: busy 9:00 - 9:30\n   - Lori: free until 10:00\n   - Conflict: Both Julie and Sean are busy until 9:30, so the first 30 minutes are blocked. Not a full free hour.\n\n2. **9:30 - 10:30:**\n   - Julie: free\n   - Sean: free\n   - Lori: busy 10:00 - 10:30\n   - Conflict: Lori is busy from 10:00, so only free from 9:30 - 10:00 (30 minutes). Not a full hour.\n\n3. **10:00 - 11:00:**\n   - Julie: free until 11:00\n   - Sean: free\n   - Lori: busy 10:00 - 10:30, then free until 11:00\n   - Conflict: Lori is busy first 30 minutes. Only free from 10:30 - 11:00 (30 minutes). Not a full hour.\n\n4. **10:30 - 11:30:**\n   - Julie: busy 11:00 - 11:30\n   - Sean: free\n   - Lori: free until 11:00, then busy 11:00 - 13:00\n   - Conflict: Julie is busy last 30 minutes, Lori is busy after 11:00. Only free from 10:30 - 11:00 (30 minutes). Not a full hour.\n\n5. **11:00 - 12:00:**\n   - Julie: busy 11:00 - 11:30, free until 12:00\n   - Sean: free\n   - Lori: busy entire hour (11:00 - 13:00)\n   - Conflict: Lori is busy. No overlap.\n\n6. **11:30 - 12:30:**\n   - Julie: free until 12:00, then busy 12:00 - 12:30\n   - Sean: free\n   - Lori: busy entire hour (11:00 - 13:00)\n   - Conflict: Lori is busy. No overlap.\n\n7. **12:00 - 13:00:**\n   - Julie: busy 12:00 - 12:30, free until 13:30\n   - Sean: free until 13:00\n   - Lori: busy entire hour (11:00 - 13:00)\n   - Conflict: Lori is busy. No overlap.\n\n8. **12:30 - 13:30:**\n   - Julie: free until 13:30\n   - Sean: busy 13:00 - 13:30\n   - Lori: busy until 13:00, then free until 15:30\n   - Conflict: Sean is busy last 30 minutes. Only free from 12:30 - 13:00 (30 minutes). Not a full hour.\n\n9. **13:00 - 14:00:**\n   - Julie: busy 13:30 - 14:00\n   - Sean: busy 13:00 - 13:30\n   - Lori: free\n   - Conflict: Julie and Sean both have parts busy. Only free from 13:30 - 14:00 (30 minutes). Not a full hour.\n\n10. **13:30 - 14:30:**\n    - Julie: busy 13:30 - 14:00, then free\n    - Sean: free\n    - Lori: free\n    - Conflict: Julie is busy first 30 minutes. Only free from 14:00 - 14:30 (30 minutes). Not a full hour.\n\n11. **14:00 - 15:00:**\n    - Julie: free\n    - Sean: free\n    - Lori: free\n    - **All free for the full hour!**\n\n12. **14:30 - 15:30:**\n    - Julie: free\n    - Sean: free\n    - Lori: free\n    - **All free for the full hour!**\n\n    (But we already found 14:00 - 15:00, so this is overlapping and also valid.)\n\n13. **15:00 - 16:00:**\n    - Julie: free until 16:00\n    - Sean: busy 15:00 - 15:30, free until 16:00\n    - Lori: busy 15:30 - 17:00\n    - Conflict: Sean is busy first 30 minutes, Lori is busy last 30 minutes. No full hour free.\n\n14. **15:30 - 16:30:**\n    - Julie: free until 16:00, then busy\n    - Sean: busy 16:00 - 16:30\n    - Lori: busy entire hour (15:30 - 17:00)\n    - Conflict: Lori is busy, Julie and Sean also have conflicts. No overlap.\n\n15. **16:00 - 17:00:**\n    - Julie: busy entire hour\n    - Sean: busy 16:00 - 16:30, free until 17:00\n    - Lori: busy entire hour\n    - Conflict: Julie and Lori are busy. No overlap.\n\n### Valid Time Slots Found:\n\nFrom the above, the full one-hour slots where all three are free are:\n- 14:00 - 15:00\n- 14:30 - 15:30\n\nHowever, since the meeting duration is exactly one hour, and both slots are valid, we can choose the earlier one for efficiency: 14:00 - 15:00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"14:00:15:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
