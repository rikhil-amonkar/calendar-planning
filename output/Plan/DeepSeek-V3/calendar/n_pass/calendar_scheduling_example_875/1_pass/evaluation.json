We need to find a one-hour slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday where both Natalie and William are free. \n\nFirst, let's list out the busy times for both Natalie and William on each day, and then find the gaps where both are available for at least one hour.\n\n### Monday:\n**Natalie's busy times:**\n- 9:00 - 9:30\n- 10:00 - 12:00\n- 12:30 - 13:00\n- 14:00 - 14:30\n- 15:00 - 16:30\n\n**William's busy times:**\n- 9:30 - 11:00\n- 11:30 - 17:00\n\n**Analyzing free times:**\n- Before 9:00: Not within work hours.\n- 9:00 - 9:30: Natalie is busy, William is free until 9:30.\n- 9:30 - 10:00: Natalie is free, William is busy.\n- 10:00 - 11:00: Both are busy.\n- 11:00 - 11:30: Natalie is free (from 12:00 - 12:30, but William is busy until 17:00).\n  \nNo overlapping free time for one hour on Monday.\n\n### Tuesday:\n**Natalie's busy times:**\n- 9:00 - 9:30\n- 10:00 - 10:30\n- 12:30 - 14:00\n- 16:00 - 17:00\n\n**William's busy times:**\n- 9:00 - 13:00\n- 13:30 - 16:00\n\n**Analyzing free times:**\n- 13:00 - 13:30: Natalie is busy until 14:00, William is free.\n- 14:00 - 16:00: Natalie is free except at 16:00, William is busy until 16:00.\n- 16:00 - 17:00: Natalie is busy, William is free.\n\nNo overlapping free time for one hour on Tuesday.\n\nWait, let me re-examine Tuesday:\nNatalie is free:\n- 9:30 - 10:00\n- 10:30 - 12:30\n- 14:00 - 16:00 (but 16:00 - 17:00 busy)\n\nWilliam is free:\n- 13:00 - 13:30\n- 16:00 - 17:00\n\nOverlap:\n- 16:00 - 17:00: Natalie is busy.\n- 14:00 - 16:00: William is busy until 16:00.\n- 13:00 - 13:30: Natalie is busy until 14:00.\n\nHmm, seems no overlap on Tuesday.\n\nWait, maybe I missed:\nNatalie is free 14:00 - 16:00, William is free 16:00 - 17:00. So at 16:00, Natalie is free until 16:00, William starts being free at 16:00. So no overlapping hour.\n\n### Wednesday:\n**Natalie's busy times:**\n- 11:00 - 11:30\n- 16:00 - 16:30\n\n**William's busy times:**\n- 9:00 - 12:30\n- 13:00 - 14:30\n- 15:30 - 16:00\n- 16:30 - 17:00\n\n**Analyzing free times:**\nNatalie is free all day except 11:00 - 11:30 and 16:00 - 16:30.\nWilliam is free:\n- 12:30 - 13:00\n- 14:30 - 15:30\n- 16:00 - 16:30 (but he's busy 15:30 - 16:00, so 16:00 is free until 16:30, but Natalie is busy 16:00 - 16:30)\n  \nPossible overlaps:\n- 14:30 - 15:30: Natalie is free, William is free.\n  \nCheck:\nNatalie: free at 14:30 - 15:30.\nWilliam: free 14:30 - 15:30.\nPerfect one-hour slot.\n\n### Thursday:\nFor completeness, let's check Thursday, though we already found a slot on Wednesday.\n\n**Natalie's busy times:**\n- 10:00 - 11:00\n- 11:30 - 15:00\n- 15:30 - 16:00\n- 16:30 - 17:00\n\n**William's busy times:**\n- 9:00 - 10:30\n- 11:00 - 11:30\n- 12:00 - 12:30\n- 13:00 - 14:00\n- 15:00 - 17:00\n\n**Analyzing free times:**\nNatalie is free:\n- 9:00 - 10:00 (but William is busy until 10:30)\n- 11:00 - 11:30 (William is busy)\n- 15:00 - 15:30 (William is busy)\n- 16:00 - 16:30 (William is busy)\n\nNo overlapping free hour on Thursday.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only one-hour slot where both Natalie and William are free is on Wednesday from 14:30 to 15:30.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"14:30:15:30\", \"day\": \"Wednesday\"}\n```",
