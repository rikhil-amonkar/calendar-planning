We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for Jose, Keith, Logan, Megan, Gary, and Bobby, considering all their existing commitments and Jose's preference not to meet after 15:30.\n\n### Step 1: List All Participants' Busy Times\nFirst, let's list out all the busy times for each participant on Monday:\n\n1. **Jose**:\n   - 11:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:30 - 13:00\n\n2. **Keith**:\n   - 14:00 - 14:30\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n\n3. **Logan**:\n   - 9:00 - 10:00\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n\n4. **Megan**:\n   - 9:00 - 10:30\n   - 11:00 - 12:00\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:30 - 16:30\n\n5. **Gary**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:00 - 10:30\n   - 11:30 - 13:00\n   - 13:30 - 14:00\n   - 14:30 - 16:30\n\n6. **Bobby**:\n   - 11:00 - 11:30\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:00 - 16:00\n\n### Step 2: Identify Available Time Slots\nWe'll look for a 30-minute window where none of the participants are busy. Also, considering Jose's preference, we'll only look up to 15:30.\n\nLet's go through the day in 30-minute increments and check availability:\n\n1. **9:00 - 9:30**:\n   - Jose: free\n   - Keith: free\n   - Logan: busy (9:00 - 10:00)\n   - Megan: busy (9:00 - 10:30)\n   - Gary: busy (9:00 - 9:30)\n   - Bobby: free\n   - **Not available** (Logan, Megan, Gary busy)\n\n2. **9:30 - 10:00**:\n   - Jose: free\n   - Keith: free\n   - Logan: busy (9:00 - 10:00)\n   - Megan: busy (9:00 - 10:30)\n   - Gary: free\n   - Bobby: free\n   - **Not available** (Logan, Megan busy)\n\n3. **10:00 - 10:30**:\n   - Jose: free\n   - Keith: free\n   - Logan: free\n   - Megan: busy (9:00 - 10:30)\n   - Gary: busy (10:00 - 10:30)\n   - Bobby: free\n   - **Not available** (Megan, Gary busy)\n\n4. **10:30 - 11:00**:\n   - Jose: free\n   - Keith: free\n   - Logan: free\n   - Megan: free\n   - Gary: free\n   - Bobby: free\n   - **Potential slot**: Let's check if any other constraints apply.\n     - All free, and before 15:30.\n   - **Available**\n\n5. **11:00 - 11:30**:\n   - Jose: busy\n   - Keith: free\n   - Logan: free\n   - Megan: busy\n   - Gary: free until 11:30, then busy\n   - Bobby: busy\n   - **Not available** (Jose, Megan, Bobby busy)\n\n6. **11:30 - 12:00**:\n   - Jose: free\n   - Keith: free\n   - Logan: free\n   - Megan: busy (11:00 - 12:00)\n   - Gary: busy (11:30 - 13:00)\n   - Bobby: free\n   - **Not available** (Megan, Gary busy)\n\n7. **12:00 - 12:30**:\n   - Jose: free\n   - Keith: free\n   - Logan: busy\n   - Megan: busy (11:00 - 12:00) - but this ends at 12:00, so from 12:00?\n     - Actually, Megan is busy until 12:00, so 12:00 - 12:30 is free unless another block starts at 12:00.\n     - Looking back: Megan's next block starts at 13:00, so 12:00 - 12:30 is free for Megan.\n   - Gary: busy (11:30 - 13:00)\n   - Bobby: busy\n   - **Not available** (Logan, Gary, Bobby busy)\n\n8. **12:30 - 13:00**:\n   - Jose: busy\n   - Keith: free\n   - Logan: free\n   - Megan: free\n   - Gary: busy\n   - Bobby: busy\n   - **Not available** (Jose, Gary, Bobby busy)\n\n9. **13:00 - 13:30**:\n   - Jose: free\n   - Keith: free\n   - Logan: free\n   - Megan: busy\n   - Gary: free (from 13:00 - 13:30 is free, then busy at 13:30)\n   - Bobby: busy\n   - **Not available** (Megan, Bobby busy)\n\n10. **13:30 - 14:00**:\n    - Jose: free\n    - Keith: free\n    - Logan: free\n    - Megan: free\n    - Gary: busy\n    - Bobby: busy\n    - **Not available** (Gary, Bobby busy)\n\n11. **14:00 - 14:30**:\n    - Jose: free\n    - Keith: busy\n    - Logan: free\n    - Megan: busy (14:30 - 16:30) - but 14:00 - 14:30 is free\n    - Gary: free (from 14:00 - 14:30 is free, then busy at 14:30)\n    - Bobby: busy\n    - **Not available** (Keith, Bobby busy)\n\n12. **14:30 - 15:00**:\n    - Jose: free\n    - Keith: free (last meeting was 15:00 - 15:30)\n    - Logan: free\n    - Megan: busy\n    - Gary: busy\n    - Bobby: busy\n    - **Not available** (Megan, Gary, Bobby busy)\n\n13. **15:00 - 15:30**:\n    - Jose: free (but has preference not after 15:30, so this is the last possible slot)\n    - Keith: busy\n    - Logan: busy\n    - Megan: busy\n    - Gary: busy\n    - Bobby: busy\n    - **Not available** (Keith, Logan, Megan, Gary, Bobby busy)\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Available Slot\nFrom the above, the only slot where everyone is free is **10:30 - 11:00**. Let's double-check each participant for this slot:\n\n- **Jose**: No meetings between 10:30 - 11:00. \u2705\n- **Keith**: No meetings between 10:30 - 11:00. \u2705\n- **Logan**: Free after 10:00 (last busy until 10:00). \u2705\n- **Megan**: Free after 10:30 (last busy until 10:30). \u2705\n- **Gary**: Free after 10:30 (last busy until 10:30). \u2705\n- **Bobby**: No meetings between 10:30 - 11:00. \u2705\n\nAlso, Jose's preference is not to meet after 15:30, and this slot is before that. \u2705\n\n### Step 4: Confirm No Other Slots\nLet's quickly scan if there are any other possible slots before concluding:\n\n- Between 10:30 - 11:00 is the only 30-minute window where all are free.\n- Other potential slots like 13:00 - 13:30 have Megan and Bobby busy.\n- Earlier slots are blocked by multiple people.\n- Later slots are either blocked or after Jose's preferred time.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe only suitable time that fits all constraints is **10:30 - 11:00 on Monday**.\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"10:30:11:00\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
