You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Deborah and Albert for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDeborah is free the entire day.\nAlbert has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 15:00 to 16:30; \n\nAlbert can not meet on Monday after 11:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: \n\nPlease output the answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"time_range\": \"{HH:MM:HH:MM}\", \"day\": \"<DAY>\"}\n\nFor example, if the proposed time is Tuesday, 14:30 to 15:30, the output should be:\n{\"time_range\": \"{14:30:15:30}\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}"

Albert's blocked times on Monday are:\n- 9:00 to 10:00\n- 10:30 to 12:00\n- 15:00 to 16:30\n\nAlbert cannot meet after 11:00, so we must consider only times before 11:00. \n\nAvailable slots for Albert before 11:00:\n- 10:00 to 10:30 (30 minutes)\n\nThis slot is free for both Deborah and Albert and fits the 30-minute duration. \n\nThe solution is:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"10:00:10:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```"
