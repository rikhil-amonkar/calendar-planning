We need to find a 30-minute slot on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 where all four participants\u2014Patrick, Kayla, Carl, and Christian\u2014are free. \n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's busy times in a more visual way to see where the overlaps are.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Patrick**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:00 - 10:30\n   - 13:30 - 14:00\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n2. **Kayla**:\n   - 12:30 - 13:30\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n3. **Carl**:\n   - 10:30 - 11:00\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:30 - 17:00\n\n4. **Christian**:\n   - 9:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:00 - 14:00\n   - 14:30 - 17:00\n\n### Approach:\nTo find a common free slot, we'll look for times when none of the participants are busy. We'll scan through the day in 30-minute increments and check each slot against everyone's schedule.\n\nLet's list possible 30-minute slots and check availability:\n\n1. **9:00 - 9:30**:\n   - Patrick: busy\n   - Christian: busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n2. **9:30 - 10:00**:\n   - Patrick: free\n   - Kayla: free\n   - Carl: free\n   - Christian: busy (until 12:30)\n   - **Not available**\n\n3. **10:00 - 10:30**:\n   - Patrick: busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n4. **10:30 - 11:00**:\n   - Patrick: free\n   - Kayla: free\n   - Carl: busy\n   - Christian: busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n5. **11:00 - 11:30**:\n   - Patrick: free\n   - Kayla: free\n   - Carl: free\n   - Christian: busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n6. **11:30 - 12:00**:\n   - Patrick: free\n   - Kayla: free\n   - Carl: free\n   - Christian: busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n7. **12:00 - 12:30**:\n   - Patrick: free\n   - Kayla: free\n   - Carl: busy\n   - Christian: busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n8. **12:30 - 13:00**:\n   - Patrick: free\n   - Kayla: busy\n   - Carl: free (from 12:30)\n   - Christian: busy until 12:30, then free until 13:00\n     - Wait, Christian is busy 9:00-12:30 and then 13:00-14:00, so 12:30-13:00 is free?\n     - Looking back: Christian is busy 9:00-12:30 and then 13:00-14:00, so 12:30-13:00 is free.\n   - But Kayla is busy 12:30-13:30.\n   - **Not available**\n\n9. **13:00 - 13:30**:\n   - Patrick: free until 13:30-14:00\n   - Kayla: busy\n   - Carl: busy\n   - Christian: busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n10. **13:30 - 14:00**:\n    - Patrick: busy\n    - Kayla: busy until 13:30, then free\n    - Carl: free (busy until 13:30, then next busy at 14:30)\n    - Christian: busy until 14:00\n    - **Not available**\n\n11. **14:00 - 14:30**:\n    - Patrick: free (last busy was 13:30-14:00)\n    - Kayla: free\n    - Carl: free (next busy at 14:30)\n    - Christian: free (busy until 14:00, then next at 14:30)\n    - **All free!**\n\n12. **14:30 - 15:00**:\n    - Carl: busy\n    - Christian: busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n13. **15:00 - 15:30**:\n    - Kayla: busy\n    - Carl: busy\n    - Christian: busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n14. **15:30 - 16:00**:\n    - Patrick: free\n    - Kayla: free (last busy was 15:00-15:30)\n    - Carl: busy\n    - Christian: busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n15. **16:00 - 16:30**:\n    - Patrick: busy\n    - Kayla: busy\n    - Carl: busy\n    - Christian: busy\n    - **Not available**\n\n16. **16:30 - 17:00**:\n    - Patrick: free\n    - Kayla: free\n    - Carl: busy\n    - Christian: busy\n    - **Not available**\n\nFrom the above, the only slot where all four are free is **14:00 - 14:30**.\n\n### Verification:\nLet's double-check this slot:\n\n- **Patrick**:\n  - Last busy: 13:30-14:00\n  - Next busy: 16:00-16:30\n  - So 14:00-14:30 is free.\n\n- **Kayla**:\n  - Last busy: 12:30-13:30\n  - Next busy: 15:00-15:30\n  - So 14:00-14:30 is free.\n\n- **Carl**:\n  - Last busy: 13:00-13:30\n  - Next busy: 14:30-17:00\n  - So 14:00-14:30 is free.\n\n- **Christian**:\n  - Last busy: 13:00-14:00\n  - Next busy: 14:30-17:00\n  - So 14:00-14:30 is free.\n\nYes, all are free during 14:00-14:30.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"14:00:14:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
