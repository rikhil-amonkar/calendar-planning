We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday where both Bobby and Michael are free. The goal is to find the earliest available time that works for both.\n\n### Step 1: List the Busy Times for Each Person on Each Day\n\nFirst, let's list out when Bobby and Michael are busy on Monday and Tuesday.\n\n#### Monday:\n- **Bobby's busy times:**\n  - 14:30 to 15:00\n- **Michael's busy times:**\n  - 9:00 to 10:00\n  - 10:30 to 13:30\n  - 14:00 to 15:00\n  - 15:30 to 17:00\n\n#### Tuesday:\n- **Bobby's busy times:**\n  - 9:00 to 11:30\n  - 12:00 to 12:30\n  - 13:00 to 15:00\n  - 15:30 to 17:00\n- **Michael's busy times:**\n  - 9:00 to 10:30\n  - 11:00 to 11:30\n  - 12:00 to 14:00\n  - 15:00 to 16:00\n  - 16:30 to 17:00\n\n### Step 2: Find Free Slots on Monday\n\nLet's find when both are free on Monday.\n\n**Bobby's free times on Monday:**\n- From 9:00 to 14:30, except 14:30-15:00 is busy, but actually, his only busy time is 14:30-15:00, so:\n  - 9:00 to 14:30 (but need to check Michael's schedule)\n\nWait, let's list all possible 30-minute slots on Monday and see which ones are free for both.\n\n**Possible 30-minute slots on Monday (from 9:00 to 17:00):**\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 9:30-10:00\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 11:30-12:00\n- 12:00-12:30\n- 12:30-13:00\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 13:30-14:00\n- 14:00-14:30\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 15:00-15:30\n- 15:30-16:00\n- 16:00-16:30\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nNow, check each slot against both schedules.\n\n**Bobby's Monday busy: 14:30-15:00**\n**Michael's Monday busy: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-17:00**\n\nSo, let's find slots where:\n- Not in Bobby's busy times (only 14:30-15:00)\n- Not in Michael's busy times (as listed above)\n\nCheck each slot:\n\n1. 9:00-9:30: Michael is busy (9:00-10:00) \u2192 No\n2. 9:30-10:00: Michael is busy \u2192 No\n3. 10:00-10:30: Michael is free (his next busy is 10:30), Bobby is free \u2192 Yes\n   - But let's see if there's an earlier one. Actually, 10:00-10:30 seems to be the first free slot for both.\n   - Wait, is Michael free at 10:00-10:30? His busy is 10:30-13:30, so 10:00-10:30 is free except the last part overlaps at 10:30, but the slot is 10:00-10:30, so it's free until 10:30.\n   - Bobby is free at 10:00-10:30.\n   - So 10:00-10:30 is free for both.\n\nBut let's check if there's any earlier slot where both are free. Earlier slots are all in Michael's busy times until 10:00. So 10:00-10:30 seems to be the earliest.\n\nBut wait, is Michael free at 10:00-10:30? His busy is 9:00-10:00 and then 10:30-13:30. So from 10:00 to 10:30, he's free except at exactly 10:30, but the slot is up to 10:30, so it's free.\n\nSimilarly, Bobby is free at 10:00-10:30 (his only busy is 14:30-15:00).\n\nSo 10:00-10:30 seems to be the earliest free slot on Monday.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other free slots on Monday after that, in case we need alternatives.\n\nNext possible slot after 10:00-10:30 is 10:30-11:00: Michael is busy (10:30-13:30) \u2192 No\n11:00-11:30: Michael busy \u2192 No\n...\nUntil 13:30-14:00: Michael's last busy is until 13:30, then free until 14:00.\nBut Bobby is free at 13:30-14:00.\nMichael is free at 13:30-14:00 (his next busy is 14:00).\nSo 13:30-14:00 is also free.\n\nBut we're looking for the earliest, so 10:00-10:30 is earlier than 13:30-14:00.\n\nNext is 14:00-14:30:\nMichael is busy at 14:00-15:00 \u2192 No\n14:30-15:00: Bobby is busy \u2192 No\n15:00-15:30:\nMichael is free (his next busy is 15:30), Bobby is free.\nBut the meeting is only until 15:30, and Michael is busy at 15:30, but the slot is 15:00-15:30, which is free for both.\nBut this is later than 10:00-10:30.\n\nSo earliest on Monday is 10:00-10:30.\n\n### Step 3: Find Free Slots on Tuesday\n\nNow, let's check Tuesday to see if there's an earlier slot than Monday's 10:00-10:30.\n\n**Bobby's Tuesday busy:**\n- 9:00-11:30\n- 12:00-12:30\n- 13:00-15:00\n- 15:30-17:00\n\n**Michael's Tuesday busy:**\n- 9:00-10:30\n- 11:00-11:30\n- 12:00-14:00\n- 15:00-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\nPossible 30-minute slots on Tuesday (from 9:00 to 17:00):\n\nLet's list possible free slots where both are free.\n\nWe're looking for the earliest, so let's go in order.\n\n1. 9:00-9:30: Bobby busy (9:00-11:30), Michael busy (9:00-10:30) \u2192 No\n2. 9:30-10:00: Bobby busy, Michael busy \u2192 No\n3. 10:00-10:30: Bobby busy, Michael busy \u2192 No\n4. 10:30-11:00: Bobby busy (until 11:30), Michael free (from 10:30 to 11:00) \u2192 Bobby is busy \u2192 No\n5. 11:00-11:30: Bobby busy, Michael busy \u2192 No\n6. 11:30-12:00: Bobby free (his next busy is 12:00), Michael free (from 11:30 to 12:00) \u2192 Both free\n   - So 11:30-12:00 is free for both.\n\nThis is earlier than Monday's 10:00-10:30? No, 11:30 is later than 10:00.\n\nBut we're looking for the earliest possible across both days, so Monday's 10:00-10:30 is earlier than Tuesday's 11:30-12:00.\n\nBut let's see if there's any earlier slot on Tuesday.\n\nNext slots on Tuesday:\n\n7. 12:00-12:30: Bobby busy, Michael busy \u2192 No\n8. 12:30-13:00: Bobby free (his next busy is 13:00), Michael busy (until 14:00) \u2192 No\n9. 13:00-13:30: Bobby busy, Michael busy \u2192 No\n10. 13:30-14:00: Bobby busy, Michael busy \u2192 No\n11. 14:00-14:30: Bobby busy (until 15:00), Michael free (from 14:00 to 15:00) \u2192 Bobby busy \u2192 No\n12. 14:30-15:00: Bobby busy, Michael free \u2192 No\n13. 15:00-15:30: Bobby free (his next busy is 15:30), Michael busy (15:00-16:00) \u2192 No\n14. 15:30-16:00: Bobby busy, Michael busy \u2192 No\n15. 16:00-16:30: Bobby busy (until 17:00), Michael free (from 16:00 to 16:30) \u2192 Bobby busy \u2192 No\n16. 16:30-17:00: Bobby busy, Michael busy \u2192 No\n\nSo the only free slot on Tuesday is 11:30-12:00, which is later than Monday's 10:00-10:30.\n\n### Step 4: Compare Both Days\n\n- **Monday:**\n  - Earliest free slot: 10:00-10:30\n- **Tuesday:**\n  - Earliest free slot: 11:30-12:00\n\nThe earliest availability is Monday at 10:00-10:30.\n\n### Step 5: Verify No Earlier Slot Exists\n\nIs there any slot earlier than 10:00-10:30 on Monday?\n\n- Before 10:00:\n  - Michael is busy from 9:00 to 10:00.\n  - So no overlap where both are free before 10:00.\n\nThus, Monday at 10:00-10:30 is indeed the earliest possible time.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"10:00:10:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
