We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 (that's 9 AM to 5 PM) on Monday through Friday where both Daniel and Bradley are free, considering their existing schedules and preferences.\n\n### Understanding the Constraints\n\nFirst, let's summarize the preferences:\n\n- **Daniel's Preferences:**\n  - Would rather not meet on Wednesday or Thursday.\n  \n- **Bradley's Preferences:**\n  - Do not want to meet on Monday.\n  - Do not want to meet on Tuesday before 12:00.\n  - Do not want to meet on Friday.\n\nGiven these preferences, let's see which days are still possible:\n\n- **Monday:** Bradley doesn't want to meet \u2192 Eliminated.\n- **Tuesday:** Bradley is okay after 12:00.\n- **Wednesday:** Daniel prefers not, but it's not a hard no. Let's keep it as a last resort.\n- **Thursday:** Daniel prefers not \u2192 Eliminated unless necessary.\n- **Friday:** Bradley doesn't want to meet \u2192 Eliminated.\n\nSo, the most likely days are **Tuesday after 12:00** or **Wednesday** if Tuesday doesn't work.\n\n### Checking Tuesday After 12:00\n\nLet's look at Tuesday's schedules after 12:00.\n\n**Daniel's Tuesday Schedule (Busy Times):**\n- 11:00 to 12:00 (but this is before 12:00, so we can ignore)\n- 13:00 to 13:30\n- 15:30 to 16:00\n- 16:30 to 17:00\n\nSo, Daniel is free on Tuesday after 12:00 except:\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 15:30-16:00\n- 16:30-17:00\n\n**Bradley's Tuesday Schedule (Busy Times):**\n- 10:30 to 11:00 (before 12:00, ignore)\n- 12:00 to 13:00\n- 13:30 to 14:00\n- 15:30 to 16:30\n\nSo, Bradley is free on Tuesday after 12:00 except:\n- 12:00-13:00\n- 13:30-14:00\n- 15:30-16:30\n\nNow, let's find overlapping free times on Tuesday after 12:00.\n\nFrom 12:00 onwards, let's list the busy intervals for both:\n\n- Daniel busy: 13:00-13:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n- Bradley busy: 12:00-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:30-16:30\n\nNow, let's find the free intervals where neither is busy:\n\n1. After 12:00:\n   - 12:00-13:00: Bradley busy\n   - 13:00-13:30: Daniel busy, Bradley just freed at 13:00 but Daniel is busy until 13:30\n   - 13:30-14:00: Bradley busy\n   - 14:00-15:30:\n     - Daniel: free\n     - Bradley: free (last busy until 14:00, next at 15:30)\n   - 15:30-16:00: both busy\n   - 16:00-16:30:\n     - Daniel: free (busy at 16:30)\n     - Bradley: busy until 16:30\n   - 16:30-17:00: Daniel busy\n\nSo, the only free slot on Tuesday is **14:00-15:30**. We need a 30-minute meeting, so possible slots:\n- 14:00-14:30\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 15:00-15:30\n\nAll of these are free for both.\n\n### Checking Wednesday (if needed)\n\nSince we found slots on Tuesday, and Daniel prefers not Wednesday, we can go with Tuesday. But for completeness, let's check Wednesday.\n\n**Daniel's Wednesday Busy:**\n- 9:00 to 10:00\n- 14:00 to 14:30\n- 15:30 to 16:00 (not listed, but looking at given data: 14:00-14:30, then next is Friday's data seems mixed, but from original data: Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 14:00 to 14:30, so rest is free)\n\nWait, let me re-examine Daniel's Wednesday busy times from the original data:\n\"Wednesday during 9:00 to 10:00, 14:00 to 14:30\"\n\nSo, Daniel is busy:\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 14:00-14:30\n\nRest is free.\n\n**Bradley's Wednesday Busy:**\n- 9:00 to 10:00\n- 11:00 to 13:00\n- 13:30 to 14:00\n- 14:30 to 17:00\n\nSo, Bradley is free on Wednesday:\n- 10:00-11:00\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 14:00-14:30 (but Bradley is busy 13:30-14:00 and 14:30-17:00, so 14:00-14:30 is actually free? Wait, no, Bradley is busy 14:30-17:00, so 14:00-14:30 is free unless there's overlap. Original says 13:30-14:00 and 14:30-17:00, so 14:00-14:30 is free.\n\nWait, let's list Bradley's Wednesday busy:\n- 9:00-10:00\n- 11:00-13:00\n- 13:30-14:00\n- 14:30-17:00\n\nSo free:\n- 10:00-11:00\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 14:00-14:30\n\nNow, find overlap with Daniel's free times (except 9:00-10:00 and 14:00-14:30):\n\nDaniel free on Wednesday except 9:00-10:00 and 14:00-14:30, so free:\n- 10:00-14:00 except 14:00-14:30 (but 14:00-14:30 is busy)\nWait, no, Daniel is busy 14:00-14:30, so free:\n- 10:00-14:00 (but 14:00-14:30 is busy, so up to 14:00)\nBut 14:00 is end of hour, so free until 14:00.\n\nBradley free:\n- 10:00-11:00\n- 13:00-13:30\n- 14:00-14:30\n\nDaniel free:\n- 10:00-14:00\n\nOverlap:\n- 10:00-11:00: both free\n- 13:00-13:30: both free\n- 14:00-14:30: Daniel busy\n\nSo possible on Wednesday:\n- 10:00-10:30\n- 10:30-11:00\n- 13:00-13:30\n\nBut since we have Tuesday options and Daniel prefers not Wednesday, let's stick with Tuesday.\n\n### Finalizing Tuesday Slot\n\nFrom Tuesday, we have:\n- 14:00-14:30\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 15:00-15:30\n\nAll are fine. Let's pick the earliest one: 14:00-14:30.\n\n### Verifying No Conflicts\n\n- Daniel on Tuesday:\n  - Busy: 13:00-13:30, 15:30-16:00, 16:30-17:00\n  - 14:00-14:30 is free.\n  \n- Bradley on Tuesday:\n  - Busy: 12:00-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:30-16:30\n  - 14:00-14:30 is after 13:30-14:00 busy, so free.\n\nNo conflicts.\n\n### Considering Preferences\n\nDaniel would rather not meet on Wednesday or Thursday, but Tuesday is okay.\nBradley is okay with Tuesday after 12:00, and it's after 12:00.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"14:00:14:30\", \"day\": \"Tuesday\"}\n```",
