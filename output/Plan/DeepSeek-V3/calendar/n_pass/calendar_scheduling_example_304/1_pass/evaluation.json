We need to find a 30-minute slot between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday that works for all six participants: Christine, Janice, Bobby, Elizabeth, Tyler, and Edward. Additionally, Janice prefers not to meet after 13:00. \n\nFirst, let's list out everyone's busy times and then find the overlapping free times.\n\n### Participants' Busy Times on Monday:\n\n1. **Christine**:\n   - 9:30 - 10:30\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n   - 16:00 - 16:30\n\n2. **Janice**:\n   - Free all day (but prefers not after 13:00)\n\n3. **Bobby**:\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 14:30 - 15:00\n\n4. **Elizabeth**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 11:30 - 13:00\n   - 13:30 - 14:00\n   - 15:00 - 15:30\n   - 16:00 - 17:00\n\n5. **Tyler**:\n   - 9:00 - 11:00\n   - 12:00 - 12:30\n   - 13:00 - 13:30\n   - 15:30 - 16:00\n   - 16:30 - 17:00\n\n6. **Edward**:\n   - 9:00 - 9:30\n   - 10:00 - 11:00\n   - 11:30 - 14:00\n   - 14:30 - 15:30\n   - 16:00 - 17:00\n\n### Janice's Preference:\n- Prefers not after 13:00, so ideally, the meeting should be before 13:00.\n\n### Approach:\nWe'll look for a 30-minute slot where none of the participants are busy, and it's before 13:00 to accommodate Janice's preference.\n\nLet's list the possible time slots before 13:00 and check availability:\n\n1. **9:00 - 9:30**:\n   - Elizabeth: busy (9:00 - 9:30)\n   - Tyler: busy (9:00 - 11:00)\n   - Edward: busy (9:00 - 9:30)\n   - **Not available**\n\n2. **9:30 - 10:00**:\n   - Christine: busy (9:30 - 10:30)\n   - Tyler: busy (9:00 - 11:00)\n   - Edward: free until 10:00 (but then busy at 10:00 - 11:00)\n   - **Christine and Tyler busy \u2192 Not available**\n\n3. **10:00 - 10:30**:\n   - Christine: busy (9:30 - 10:30)\n   - Tyler: busy (9:00 - 11:00)\n   - Edward: busy (10:00 - 11:00)\n   - **Not available**\n\n4. **10:30 - 11:00**:\n   - Christine: free (busy until 10:30)\n   - Tyler: busy (9:00 - 11:00)\n   - Edward: busy (10:00 - 11:00)\n   - **Tyler and Edward busy \u2192 Not available**\n\n5. **11:00 - 11:30**:\n   - Christine: free\n   - Tyler: free (busy until 11:00, next at 12:00)\n   - Edward: free until 11:30\n   - Others:\n     - Elizabeth: free until 11:30\n     - Bobby: free\n     - Janice: free\n   - **All free!**\n\n6. **11:30 - 12:00**:\n   - Elizabeth: busy (11:30 - 13:00)\n   - Edward: busy (11:30 - 14:00)\n   - **Not available**\n\n7. **12:00 - 12:30**:\n   - Christine: busy\n   - Bobby: busy\n   - Tyler: busy\n   - **Not available**\n\n8. **12:30 - 13:00**:\n   - Elizabeth: busy (11:30 - 13:00)\n   - Edward: busy (11:30 - 14:00)\n   - **Not available**\n\nAfter 13:00, even though Janice prefers not to meet, let's check if there's any slot in case we can't find one before 13:00. But we already found one at 11:00 - 11:30.\n\n### Verifying 11:00 - 11:30:\n- Christine: free\n- Janice: free (and before 13:00)\n- Bobby: free\n- Elizabeth: free (until 11:30)\n- Tyler: free\n- Edward: free (until 11:30)\n\nAll are free during this time, and it's before 13:00, satisfying Janice's preference.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"time_range\": \"11:00:11:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"}\n```",
