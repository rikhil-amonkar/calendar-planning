(Available connections: Berlin \u2013 Munich and Munich \u2013 Dubrovnik.)\nTo \u201cfit\u201d the 4 + 3 + 3 = 10 desired city\u2013days into 8 unique days, the program uses the idea\nof overlapping days. The departure day from one city is simultaneously counted as part of that city\u2019s stay\n(and so can be \u201cre\u2010used\u201d as the arrival day for the next city). In our computed solution the itinerary order\nis chosen as Berlin \u2192 Munich \u2192 Dubrovnik. Then the overlapping is arranged such that:\n  \u2013 The Berlin segment runs from Day 1 to Day 4 (giving 4 days; conference Day 1 and Day 4 are in Berlin).\n  \u2013 The Munich segment runs from Day 4 to Day 6 (overlapping Day 4 counts for both Berlin and Munich,\n    and giving Munich a total of 3 days: Days 4, 5 and 6).\n  \u2013 The Dubrovnik segment runs from Day 6 to Day 8 (overlapping Day 6 counts for both Munich and Dubrovnik,\n    and yielding 3 days in Dubrovnik: Days 6, 7 and 8).\nBetween segments a flight is \u201ctaken\u201d on the common (overlap) day.\nThe resulting itinerary meets all the constraints.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    # Input parameters\n    total_days = 8\n    # Desired durations (in days) that the traveler wants to spend in each city.\n    # Note: These counts are \u201cdesired\u201d, but because total unique days is 8, we must overlap one day\n    # at each transition so that the \u201creported\u201d days add up to 10.\n    desired_durations = {\n        \"Berlin\": 4,\n        \"Munich\": 3,\n        \"Dubrovnik\": 3,\n    }\n    # Direct flight connections available (bidirectional)\n    # Note: The only allowed moves are those between cities with direct flights.\n    direct_flights = {\n        (\"Berlin\", \"Munich\"),\n        (\"Munich\", \"Berlin\"),\n        (\"Munich\", \"Dubrovnik\"),\n        (\"Dubrovnik\", \"Munich\"),\n    }\n    # The conference constraints: must be in Berlin on Day 1 and Day 4.\n    conference_days = {1, 4}\n    \n    # For our solution we must choose an itinerary order that:\n    # 1.

In our model,\nconference days in Venice are strict (and fixed as days 4-5) so the route must end in Venice.\nBecause the only flight connection into Venice is from Madrid, the only possible order\nthat visits all 3 cities is: Geneva \u2192 Madrid \u2192 Venice (flights assumed bidirectional).\n\nTo \u201coptimize\u201d the itinerary we try to minimize the total deviation from the ideal city-days while\nobeying the fixed and transition constraints. With 5 total days and 2 transit events (which occur\nat the boundary between stay segments), the \u201cpure stay\u201d days available are 5 days.\nSince Venice is fixed (days 4 and 5, exactly 2 days), the remaining days for Geneva and Madrid\nare days 1\u20133 (three days in all). We have two choices to split these three days:\n  Option A: Geneva 1 day and Madrid 2 days  \u2192 deviation: |1-2| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 \n  Option B: Geneva 2 days and Madrid 1 day  \u2192 deviation: |2-2| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2\nBoth yield a total deviation of 2. Since one of the wishes is to visit Madrid for 3 days,\nwe choose Option A (which gives a longer Madrid visit).\n\nWe assume that flights occur instantaneously at the end of a day so that the day numbering for stays is:\n  \u2022 Day 1: Geneva stay (1 full day), then a flight at the end of Day 1 to Madrid.\n  \u2022 Days 2\u20133: Madrid stay (2 full days), with a flight at the end of Day 3 to Venice.\n  \u2022 Days 4\u20135: Venice stay (2 full days, with conference obligations).\n\nThe program computes and outputs a JSON-formatted itinerary showing the day ranges for stays and the flight transitions.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport json\n\ndef compute_itinerary():\n    total_days = 5\n\n    # Given constraints:\n    # Fixed: Venice (conference) must occupy days 4-5.\n    venice_start = 4\n    venice_end = 5\n    venice_days = venice_end - venice_start + 1  # equals 2\n    \n    # Wishes for city stay (ideal but overall days force trade-off)\n    ideal_geneva = 2\n    ideal_madrid = 3\n    ideal_venice = 2  # fixed by conference\n\n    # Available days for Geneva and Madrid (since Venice is fixed to days 4-5)\n    remaining_days = total_days - venice_days  # 5 - 2 = 3\n\n    # Two possible splits for remaining_days:\n    # Option A: Geneva gets 1 day, Madrid gets 2 days.\n    # Option B: Geneva gets 2 days, Madrid gets 1 day.\n    # Compute total deviations from the ideal wishes:\n    deviation_A = abs(1 - ideal_geneva) + abs(2 - ideal_madrid)\n    deviation_B = abs(2 - ideal_geneva) + abs(1 - ideal_madrid)\n\n    # Choose option with lower or equal deviation but with preference for a longer Madrid visit.\n    if deviation_A <= deviation_B:\n        geneva_days = 1\n        madrid_days = 2\n    else:\n        geneva_days = 2\n        madrid_days = 1\n\n    # Compute the itinerary day boundaries.\n    # We assume flights occur immediately after a stay segment.\n    itinerary = []\n    day_counter = 1\n\n    # Segment 1: Geneva stay.\n    geneva_start_day = day_counter\n    geneva_end_day = day_counter + geneva_days - 1\n    itinerary.append({\n        \"day_range\": f\"Day {geneva_start_day}-{geneva_end_day}\",\n        \"place\": \"Geneva\"\n    })\n    day_counter = geneva_end_day  # flight will leave at end of this day\n\n    # Flight from Geneva to Madrid (assumed instantaneous at the end of the day).\n    itinerary.append({\n        \"flying\": f\"Flight on Day {day_counter}\",\n        \"from\": \"Geneva\",\n        \"to\": \"Madrid\"\n    })\n\n    # Next segment: Madrid stay.\n    # Madrid stay begins on next day.\n    day_counter += 1\n    madrid_start_day = day_counter\n    madrid_end_day = day_counter + madrid_days - 1\n    itinerary.append({\n        \"day_range\": f\"Day {madrid_start_day}-{madrid_end_day}\",\n        \"place\": \"Madrid\"\n    })\n    day_counter = madrid_end_day\n\n    # Flight from Madrid to Venice (assumed at end of Madrid segment).\n    itinerary.append({\n        \"flying\": f\"Flight on Day {day_counter}\",\n        \"from\": \"Madrid\",\n        \"to\": \"Venice\"\n    })\n\n    # Final segment: Venice stay fixed because of the conference.\n    # It must occupy days 4-5.

Only direct flights are allowed.\nThe available direct routes are:\n  \u2022 Budapest \u21c4 Mykonos \n  \u2022 Hamburg \u21c4 Budapest\nBecause the \u201craw\u201d sums of full days in each city (6+3+2 = 11) exceed 9, we assume that\non days when a flight is taken the day is \u201csplit\u201d so that the departure city and the arrival city both count.\nIn the computed itinerary below, a flight segment is assumed to occur on a single day so that morning counts for the departing city and the afternoon for the arriving city.\nThus the \u201ccity\u2010day counts\u201d can exceed 9 while the trip still lasts 9 calendar days.\nIn our solution the itinerary is arranged in the order:\n  Mykonos \u2192 Budapest \u2192 Hamburg \u2192 Budapest \u2192 Mykonos\nand the flight days (which provide the necessary overlap to \u201csave\u201d calendar time) are chosen so that:\n  \u2022 Mykonos has 4 full days plus 2 \u201chalf\u2010days\u201d (morning of a flight day and afternoon of a flight day) giving 6 days.\n  \u2022 Budapest gets 5 \u201chalf\u2010days\u201d (from arrivals or departures) plus 1 full day = 3+?

The available direct connections are:\n      \u2013 Lisbon \u21c6 Lyon \n      \u2013 Lisbon \u21c6 Zurich\n  \u2022 On Day 8 and Day 13 you must attend a conference in Lyon.\n  \nBecause the stays in cities must add up to more days than the calendar trip (7 + 6 + 2 = 15)\nwe interpret the rules so that flight days \u201coverlap\u201d (the day a flight is taken counts\ntoward the stay in both the departure and arrival city). In other words, the two \u201coverlap\u201d\ndays reduce the total calendar days to 15 \u2013 2 = 13.\n  \nOne solution is to arrange the itinerary in two parts:\n  (A) Pre\u2010Lyon \u201chome base\u201d in Lisbon of 7 calendar days. During those 7 days the Lisbon day count is met if\n      two day\u2010trips are taken to Zurich (each day\u2010trip counts as a day for both Lisbon and Zurich).\n      For example, spend full days in Lisbon except on two selected days you fly out\n      from Lisbon to Zurich in the morning and then return by the evening. These two days provide\n      the required 2 days in Zurich while still \u201cusing\u201d that day as a Lisbon day.\n  (B) A final segment in Lyon for 6 calendar days (Days 8\u201313) so that you are present on Day 8 and Day 13 for the conference.\n  \nIn this solution:\n  \u2022 Days 1\u20137 are used as the \u201cLisbon base\u201d. Days 2 and 4 become day\u2010trips to Zurich.\n    (On those days, two flights occur: one from Lisbon to Zurich and one from Zurich back to Lisbon.)\n    In this way Lisbon is \u201cvisited\u201d on all 7 days and Zurich gets exactly 2 days.\n  \u2022 On Day 8 a flight from Lisbon to Lyon is taken (flight days overlap, so Day 8 becomes a full Lyon day)\n    and Days 8\u201313 in Lyon add up to 6 days (with the mandatory conference on Day 8 and Day 13).\n  \nThe program computes and then outputs the itinerary as a JSON\u2010formatted list of dictionary segments.\nThe structure is similar to the example:\n  [{'day_range':'Day 1-5','place':'Helsinki'}, {'flying':'Day 5-5', 'from':'Helsinki','to':'Barcelona'}, ... ]\n\"\"\"\n\nimport json\n\ndef main():\n    # Input parameters\n    total_days = 13\n    cities = ['Lisbon', 'Lyon', 'Zurich']\n    # Required \u201ccity\u2010days\u201d (overlap flight days count twice in these sums)\n    required_city_days = {\n        'Lisbon': 7,\n        'Lyon': 6,\n        'Zurich': 2\n    }\n    # Conference days in Lyon must be included\n    conference_days = {'Lyon': [8, 13]}\n    \n    # Available direct flights (assume bidirectional)\n    available_flights = [\n        ('Lisbon', 'Lyon'),\n        ('Lyon', 'Lisbon'),\n        ('Lisbon', 'Zurich'),\n        ('Zurich', 'Lisbon')\n    ]\n    \n    # Compute the itinerary:\n    # Our plan is to split the trip into two main parts:\n    # PRE-LYON: Days 1-7 in Lisbon (with two day-trip excursions to Zurich)\n    # POST: Days 8-13 in Lyon (which includes conference days on Day 8 and Day 13).\n    \n    # For the pre-Lyon portion, we design two day trips to Zurich:\n    # - On Day 2: depart Lisbon->Zurich and return Zurich->Lisbon.
