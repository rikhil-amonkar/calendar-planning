Alright, I need to help Harold and Patrick schedule a half-hour meeting between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll outline Patrick's busy periods. He's booked from 9:00 to 9:30, then from 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, and 15:00 to 16:30. Harold is available all day, so the main constraint is Patrick's schedule.

The goal is to find the earliest possible half-hour slot where both are available. I should consider each time slot where Patrick isn't busy and check if there's a half-hour window that fits.

Let me list all the time slots where Patrick is free:

1. 9:00 to 9:30 - He's busy, so no.
2. 9:30 to 10:30 - He's busy until 10:30, so after 9:30 until 10:30 is free? Wait, no, his first busy slot is 9:00-9:30, then from 10:30 onwards. So between 9:30 and 10:30, he's free for half an hour. But the meeting needs to be half an hour, so maybe 9:30 to 10:00 or 10:00 to 10:30. Wait, but the meeting has to be exactly half an hour. So if we start at 9:30, that's 30 minutes. Or 9:30 to 10:00 is 30 minutes. Wait, but Patrick is busy until 10:30, so from 9:30 to 10:30 is his busy time? No, his first busy period is 9:00-9:30, then 10:30-12:00. So between 9:30 and 10:30, he's free. So the earliest possible is 9:30 to 10:00. That's a 30-minute window.

Wait, but let me check the initial busy periods. Patrick is busy from 9:00-9:30, then 10:30-12:00, etc. So between 9:30 and 10:30, he's free. So the earliest possible meeting time is 9:30 to 10:00.

But wait, the meeting needs to be exactly half an hour. So starting at 9:30 for 30 minutes would end at 10:00, which is within his free time. So that's possible.

But let me make sure. Let's list all possible free slots:

- 9:30-10:30 (free, but needs to be 30 minutes)
- 12:00-12:30 (free, but only 30 minutes)
- 13:30-14:00 (free, 30 minutes)
- 14:30-15:00 (free, 30 minutes)
- 16:30-17:00 (free, 30 minutes)

Wait, but after 15:00, Patrick is busy again until 16:30. So from 16:30 to 17:00, he's free for 30 minutes.

So the possible half-hour slots are:

1. 9:30-10:00
2. 12:00-12:30
3. 13:30-14:00
4. 14:30-15:00
5. 16:30-17:00

Now, the earliest is 9:30, so that's the best option.

To find the earliest half-hour slot available for Harold and Patrick, we analyze Patrick's schedule and identify the earliest free 30-minute window. Patrick is free from 9:30 to 10:30, allowing for a 9:30 to 10:00 meeting.

**Answer:**

The earliest available time is **9:30 AM to 10:00 AM**.
