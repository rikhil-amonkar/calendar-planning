To find a suitable time for the meeting, we need to examine Patrick's busy schedule and find a half-hour time slot that works for both Harold and Patrick.

Patrick's busy schedule:
- 9:00 to 9:30
- 10:30 to 12:00
- 12:30 to 13:30
- 14:00 to 14:30
- 15:00 to 16:30

Patrick is free from 9:30 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:00, and 16:30 to 17:00. However, we need to find a half-hour time slot. 

A suitable time that works for both Harold and Patrick is 13:30 to 14:00.
