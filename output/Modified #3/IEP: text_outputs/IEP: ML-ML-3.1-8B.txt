To find the earliest available time slot for a 30-minute meeting, we need to sort the busy time slots in ascending order and then find the first gap that is at least 30 minutes long. 

First, sort Patrick's busy time slots in ascending order: 
- 9:00 - 9:30
- 9:30 - 10:00 (overlap with the previous slot, ignore)
- 10:30 - 12:00
- 12:30 - 13:30
- 14:00 - 14:30
- 15:00 - 16:30

Ignore the overlapping slots (9:30 - 10:00) and the first slot (9:00 - 9:30) since we can schedule the meeting before 9:00 or after 9:30.

The first available time slot is from 9:00 to 9:30 (30 minutes long), but we can't schedule the meeting before 9:00 since the work hours start at 9:00. So, we consider the next available time slot.

The next available time slot is from 9:30 to 10:30 (1 hour long), but we only need a 30-minute slot. We can schedule the meeting from 10:00 to 10:30, which is the first available time slot that is at least 30 minutes long.

Therefore, the proposed time for the meeting is Monday, 10:00 - 10:30.
