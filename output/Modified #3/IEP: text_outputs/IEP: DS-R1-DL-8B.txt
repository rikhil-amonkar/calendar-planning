Alright, I need to help Harold and Patrick schedule a half-hour meeting between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. Harold's calendar is completely open, which means he's available anytime during those hours. Patrick, on the other hand, has several busy periods throughout the day. 

First, I'll list out Patrick's busy times to clearly see when he's unavailable. Patrick is busy from:
- 9:00 to 9:30
- 10:30 to 12:00
- 12:30 to 13:30
- 14:00 to 14:30
- 15:00 to 16:30

So, the times when Patrick is free would be the gaps between these busy periods. Let me break down the day into half-hour slots to make it easier:

9:00 - 9:30 (busy)
9:30 - 10:00 (free)
10:00 - 10:30 (busy)
10:30 - 11:00 (free)
11:00 - 11:30 (busy)
11:30 - 12:00 (free)
12:00 - 12:30 (busy)
12:30 - 13:00 (free)
13:00 - 13:30 (busy)
13:30 - 14:00 (free)
14:00 - 14:30 (busy)
14:30 - 15:00 (free)
15:00 - 15:30 (busy)
15:30 - 16:00 (free)
16:00 - 16:30 (busy)
16:30 - 17:00 (free)

Now, I need to find a half-hour slot that is completely free for Patrick and within Harold's availability. Since Harold is free all day, the only constraints are Patrick's schedule.

Looking at the free times, the earliest possible slot after 9:00 is 9:30 - 10:00. That's a 30-minute window, which fits the meeting time required.

Wait, but Patrick is busy from 9:00 to 9:30, so 9:30 - 10:00 is right after that. That's a good spot. But let me double-check if there's an earlier time. Between 9:00 to 9:30, Patrick is busy, so the next available time is 9:30 - 10:00. That seems to be the earliest possible time.

I should also check if any other times before that might work, but since the meeting has to be 30 minutes and Patrick is busy until 10:00, 9:30 - 10:00 is the earliest.

So, the meeting should be scheduled at 9:30 - 10:00 to accommodate both Harold and Patrick's schedules.

Here is the proposed time: Monday, 9:30 - 10:00. Reason: This is the earliest possible time slot where Patrick is free and Harold's calendar is open.
